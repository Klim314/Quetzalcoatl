TI  - Antiviral, Antifungal and Antibacterial Activities of a BODIPY-Based Photosensitizer.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) employing the BODIPY-based photosensitizer 2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-4,4'-difluoro-boradiazainda cene (DIMPy-BODIPY) was explored in an in vitro assay against six species of bacteria (eight total strains), three species of yeast, and three viruses as a complementary approach to their current drug-based or non-existent treatments. Our best results achieved a noteworthy 5-6 log unit reduction in CFU at 0.1 muM for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-2913), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (ATCC-44), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (ATCC-2320), a 4-5 log unit reduction for Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC-19606 (0.25 muM), multidrug resistant A. baumannii ATCC-1605 (0.1 muM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-97 (0.5 muM), and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-2146 (1 muM), and a 3 log unit reduction for Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 (ATCC-700084). A 5 log unit reduction in CFU was observed for Candida albicans ATCC-90028 (1 muM) and Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC-64538 (0.5 muM), and a 3 log unit reduction was noted for Candida glabrata ATCC-15545 (1 muM). Infectivity was reduced by 6 log units in dengue 1 (0.1 muM), by 5 log units (0.5 muM) in vesicular stomatitis virus, and by 2 log units (5 muM) in human adenovirus-5. Overall, the results demonstrate that DIMPy-BODIPY exhibits antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal photodynamic inactivation at nanomolar concentrations and short illumination times.
TI  - Telavancin activity tested against Gram-positive clinical isolates from European, Russian and Israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against Gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in European and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. METHODS: 11 601 consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. Interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the FDA and EUCAST, as available. RESULTS: Telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus. All Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for VanA-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin MIC, >1 mg/l). Telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MIC values were obtained for VanA strains. Telavancin (both MIC50 and MIC90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the FDA/EUCAST-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. VanA-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. These results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from Europe.
TI  - Nosocomial Infections and Microbiologic Spectrum after Major Elective Surgery of  the Pancreas, Liver, Stomach, and Esophagus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of infections treated by surgeons are nosocomial infections (NI). The frequency of these infections in relation to the organ operated on as well as the organisms involved are not well defined. Detailed knowledge of these issues is essential for optimal care of surgical patients. This study aimed to determine infection rates and the responsible pathogens after major elective surgery of the pancreas, liver, stomach, and esophagus. METHODS: Between January 1, 2005 and August 31, 2007, the records of all patients of the Department of General, Abdominal and Vascular Surgery, University Hospital Magdeburg (Germany) with elective resection of the pancreas, liver, stomach, and esophagus were evaluated retrospectively. Study parameters were: Patient number, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, indication for resection, operation duration, length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital, mortality, organ-related rate and kind of NI, and microbiologic spectrum. Nosocomial infections were defined as: Surgical site infection (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 1 or 2) and intra-abdominal infection (CDC 3), urinary tract infection, clinical sepsis, blood stream and catheter-related infection, respiratory tract infection, and pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 358 patients were included: 150 (42%) with pancreas resection, 91 (25%) with liver resection, 105 (29%) with gastric resection, and 12 (3%) with esophagus resection. Median LOS in the ICU for all groups was 48.8 h (interquartile range [IQR] 24.9-91.8 h), median LOS in hospital was 16 d (IQR 13-23 d), and in-hospital mortality was 4.5%. Patients with NI had significantly greater in-hospital death and prolonged stay in hospital and ICU (p<0.001). In 120 (33.5%) patients, one or more NI occurred (range, 83% in esophagus patients to 21% in liver patients). Intra-abdominal (16.5%) and surgical site infections (12.3%) were most frequent; 80.8% of the NI were culture-positive. The most frequent clinically relevant isolates were Escherichia coli (12.4%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (12.2%), and Enterococcus faecium (9.7%). The highest resistance rates were found for Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] 29.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.5%). CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing elective surgery of the pancreas, liver, stomach, and esophagus, considerable differences in demographic factors, frequency, and kind of NI exist. The consequences of NI force surgeons to analyze pre-operative risk factors carefully, assess indications for operation thoroughly, and optimize all controllable parameters.
TI  - [Bloodstream infections in southwestern China: 2012 Whire Union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. METHODS: Blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the Whire Union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. We performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using WHONET5. 5 and SPSS19.0. RESULTS: A total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 Gram-positive (50.26%); 868 Gram-negative (49.74%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcius (CNS, 541 strains, 31.00%), Escherichia coli (ECO, 379 strains, 21.72%), Klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), Enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and Staphylococcus aureus (SAU, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. Methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of S. aureus and 85.4% of CNS, respectively. Zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9% resistance to linezolid, respectively. Imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% E. coli, 3.6% Klebsiella spp., and 11.1% Enterobacter spp.. Nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in P. aeruginosa and 79.1% in Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for MRSA and multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections. Patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections than others. CONCLUSION: CNS, E. coli,Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp. and S. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in Southwestern China. Low methicillin-resistant rate was found in Staphylococcus aureus. But vancomycin-resistant rate was high in E. faecium. Imipenem-resistant rates varied in Enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in Acinetobacter spp. Use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.
TI  - A novel gene, optrA, that confers transferable resistance to oxazolidinones and phenicols and its presence in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium of human and animal origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The oxazolidinone-resistant Enterococcus faecalis E349 from a human patient tested negative for the cfr gene and 23S rRNA mutations. Here we report the identification of a novel oxazolidinone resistance gene, optrA, and a first investigation of the extent to which this gene was present in E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from humans and food-producing animals. METHODS: The resistance gene optrA was identified by whole-plasmid sequencing and subsequent cloning and expression in a susceptible Enterococcus host. Transformation and conjugation assays served to investigate the transferability of optrA. All optrA-positive E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates of human and animal origin were analysed for their MICs and their genotype, as well as the location of optrA. RESULTS: The novel plasmid-borne ABC transporter gene optrA from E. faecalis E349 conferred combined resistance or elevated MICs (when no clinical breakpoints were available) to oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid) and phenicols (chloramphenicol and florfenicol). The corresponding conjugative plasmid pE349, on which optrA was located, had a size of 36 331 bp and also carried the phenicol exporter gene fexA. The optrA gene was functionally expressed in E. faecalis, E. faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. It was detected more frequently in E. faecalis and E. faecium from food-producing animals (20.3% and 5.7%, respectively) than from humans (4.2% and 0.6%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Enterococci with elevated MICs of linezolid and tedizolid should be tested not only for 23S rRNA mutations and the gene cfr, but also for the novel resistance gene optrA.
TI  - Bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (APNTP) against  the ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. The 'ESKAPE' pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) have been highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. The stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. Atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (APNTP) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. This study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed APNTP jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the ESKAPE pathogens. Standard plate counts and the XTT metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of APNTP, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. APNTP exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the ESKAPE pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and complete eradication of ESKAPE pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of A. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. This demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Repurposing Non-antimicrobial Drugs and Clinical Molecules to Treat Bacterial Infections.
AB  - There is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. A library, containing 727 FDA approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobactercloacae). Drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. The initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) isolates. Two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (EB) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus isolates including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA).The minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of S. aureus were inhibited (MIC90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/L for EB and FdUrd, respectively. Treatment with EB orally significantly increased mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic MRSA-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. FdUrd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. These data encourage screening and repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Global in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents: Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004-2013.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global  antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study which has been ongoing since 2004. This report examines the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against clinically important pathogens collected globally between 2004 and 2013. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The Cochran Armitage Trend Test was used to identify statistically significant changes in susceptibility between 2004 and 2013. RESULTS: Among the Enterobacteriaceae susceptibility was highest to the carbapenems [imipenem 97.1% (24,655/25,381), meropenem 97.0% (90,714/93,518)], tigecycline (97.0%, 115,361/118,899) and amikacin (96.9%, 115,200/118,899). Against Acinetobacter baumannii the highest rates of susceptibility were for minocycline (84.5%, 14,178/16,778) and imipenem (80.0%, 3,037/3,795). The MIC90 for tigecycline was 2 mg/L. 40% (6,743/16,778) of A. baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant. Enterococci were highly susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid (>99%); vancomycin resistance was observed among 2% of Enterococcus faecalis (325/14,615) and 35% of Enterococcus faecium (2,136/6,167) globally. 40% (14,647/36,448) of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant while 15% (2,152/14,562) of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant. Against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline was >/=99.9%. Globally, 81% (331/410) of statistically significant susceptibility changes during the study period were decreases in susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Amikacin, the carbapenems, and tigecycline were active against most gram-negative pathogens while linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin retained activity against most gram-positive pathogens collected in TEST during 2004-2013.
TI  - Repurposing Salicylanilide Anthelmintic Drugs to Combat Drug Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the US. Repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. In this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. The FDA approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant S. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): 0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). The two drugs were also effective against another Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium (MIC 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the Gram-negative species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant S. aureus clinical isolates, with MICs at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. A time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. Interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. Oxyclozanide was non-toxic to HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro MICs but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. These data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
TI  - Evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Hampton Roads, Virginia.
AB  - We studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated with Eastern Virginia Medical School. The data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram- positive and E. coli the most common Gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. Overall 53% of S.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. There was a broad scatter of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and MIC of 4 mug/mL was reported in 2012. Penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of Enterococcus faecium and 2% of Enterococcus faecalis respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant Gram negative organism in the data compiled. Among the Escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( SXT) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. We found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. Based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.
TI  - Antibiotics in agriculture and the risk to human health: how worried should we be?
AB  - The use of antibiotics in agriculture is routinely described as a major contributor to the clinical problem of resistant disease in human medicine. While a link is plausible, there are no data conclusively showing the magnitude of the threat emerging from agriculture. Here, we define the potential mechanisms by which agricultural antibiotic use could lead to human disease and use case studies to critically assess the potential risk from each. The three mechanisms considered are as follows 1: direct infection with resistant bacteria from an animal source, 2: breaches in the species barrier followed by sustained transmission in humans of resistant strains arising in livestock, and 3: transfer of resistance genes from agriculture into human pathogens. Of these, mechanism 1 is the most readily estimated, while significant is small in comparison with the overall burden of resistant disease. Several cases of mechanism 2 are known, and we discuss the likely livestock origins of resistant clones of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, but while it is easy to show relatedness the direction of transmission is hard to assess in robust fashion. More difficult yet to study is the contribution of mechanism 3, which may be the most important of all.
TI  - Auranofin exerts broad-spectrum bactericidal activities by targeting thiol-redox  homeostasis.
AB  - Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a rising public health threat and make the identification of new antibiotics a priority. From a cell-based screen for bactericidal compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis under nutrient-deprivation conditions we identified auranofin, an orally bioavailable FDA-approved antirheumatic drug, as having potent bactericidal activities against both replicating and nonreplicating M. tuberculosis. We also found that auranofin is active against other Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, and drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Our biochemical studies showed that auranofin inhibits the bacterial thioredoxin reductase, a protein essential in many Gram-positive bacteria for maintaining the thiol-redox balance and protecting against reactive oxidative species. Auranofin decreases the reducing capacity of target bacteria, thereby sensitizing them to oxidative stress. Finally, auranofin was efficacious in a murine model of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection. These results suggest that the thioredoxin-mediated redox cascade of Gram-positive pathogens is a valid target for the development of antibacterial drugs, and that the existing clinical agent auranofin may be repurposed to aid in the treatment of several important antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Bacillusin A, an Antibacterial Macrodiolide from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AP183.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of the organic extracts of a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain (AP183) led to the discovery of a new macrocyclic polyene antibiotic, bacillusin A (1). Its structure was assigned by interpretation of NMR and MS spectroscopic data as a novel macrodiolide composed of dimeric 4-hydroxy-2-methoxy-6-alkenylbenzoic acid lactones with conjugated pentaene-hexahydroxy polyketide chains. Compound 1 showed potent antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium with minimum inhibitory concentrations in a range of 0.6 to 1.2 mug/mL. The biosynthetic significance of this unique class of antibiotic compounds is briefly discussed.
TI  - New antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  - Microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. Moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging. In search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. The antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth of the nosocomial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical E. faecalis, E. faecium, and S. aureus isolates. It also strongly reduced the growth of Legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of Escherichia coli in urine. We postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. Thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) directly from positive blood culture flasks allows rapid identification of bloodstream infections in immunosuppressed hosts.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In immunosuppressed hosts, rapid identification of microorganisms of bloodstream infections is crucial to ensuring effective antimicrobial therapy. Conventional culture requires up to 72 h from sample collection to pathogen identification. METHODS: We used the SepsiTyper Kit and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF; Microflex, Bruker) directly from positive blood culture (BacT/ALERT 3D, FN/FA vials; bioMerieux) in comparison to standard culture methodology (VITEK 2; bioMerieux) for species identification. RESULTS: A total of 62 consecutive positive blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients (solid organ or hematopoietic transplant recipients, or with febrile neutropenia) were analyzed. Culture yielded gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in 27/62 (43.5%) and gram-positive (GPB) in 35/62 (56.5%) vials. For GNB, the predominant species identified by MALDI-TOF and confirmed by VITEK were Escherichia coli (16/16 correctly identified) and Enterobacter cloacae (4/4), with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.6% and 100%, respectively. For GPB, predominant species were Staphylococcus aureus (3/3), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12/24), and Enterococcus faecium (6/6) with a sensitivity of 100%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. The median time from blood collection to species identification was 27.4 h with MALDI-TOF identification and 46.6 h with conventional methodology. CONCLUSION: Using MALDI-TOF directly from positive blood cultures allowed a shorter time to identification with high sensitivity and specificity in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - Spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  - Ac-GF(A6c)G(A6c)K(A6c)G(A6c)F(A6c)G(A6c)GK(A6c)KKKK-amide (A6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43muM. Spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this AMP interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. CD and 2D-(1)H NMR experiments indicated this AMP on binding to SDS and DPC micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages of helical and random coil conformers. CD investigations in the presence of three phospholipid SUVs consisting of POPC, 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC revealed: (1) The interactions occurring with POPC SUVs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the AMP yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) The interactions with 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC SUVs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the CD spectra. (3) The presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of SUVs as was the case with micelles. This data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this AMP are very different from the diversity of conformations adopted by this AMP on insertion into the lipid bilayer. CD spectra of this AMP in the presence of SUVs consisting of LPS isolated from P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.
TI  - Development of novel antibacterial drugs to combat multiple resistant organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are increasing both in hospitals and in the community and are characterized by high mortality rates. New molecules are in development to face the need of active compounds toward resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. In particular, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has supported the initiative to develop ten new antibacterials within 2020. Principal targets are the so-called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae). PURPOSE: To review the characteristics and the status of development of new antimicrobials including new cephalosporins, carbapenems, beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines. CONCLUSIONS: While numerous new compounds target resistant gram-positive pathogens and have been approved for clinical use, very few new molecules are active against MDR gram-negative pathogens, especially carbapenemase producers. New glycopeptides and oxazolidinones are highly efficient against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and new cephalosporins and carbapenems also display activity toward MDR gram-positive bacteria. Although new cephalosporins and carbapenems have acquired activity against MRSA, they offer few advantages against difficult-to-treat gram-negatives. Among agents that are potentially active against MDR gram-negatives are ceftozolane/tazobactam, new carbapenems, the combination of avibactam with ceftazidime, and plazomicin. Since a relevant number of promising antibiotics is currently in development, regulatory approvals over the next 5 years are crucial to face the growing threat of multidrug resistance.
TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy of akacid plus(R) fogging in eradicating causative microorganism in nosocomial infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The novel polymeric guanidine Akacid Plus(R) is a member of the cationic family of disinfectants. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the activity of Akacid Plus(R) against bacteria which cause nosocomial infections and remain viable after contaminating the environment and determine the effects of organic materials to the activity. METHODS: Closed room and control room were created for experimental disinfection. Bacterial suspensions of 0.5 McFarland were prepared from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii and vancomycine-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) strains. A 0.1 mL of each suspension was applied on the chipboard (25 cm(2)) and tile (25 cm(2)) test surfaces without albumin and with 2% albumin to simulate organic dirt, and the test surfaces were placed in the test and control rooms after drying. Before testing, cotton swab premoistened with serum physiologic was used to obtain samples from various surfaces in the environment and the samples were transferred onto 5% sheep blood agar for incubation at 37 degrees C. Akacid Plus(R) solution at a concentration of 0.5% was nebulized with an aerosol applicator (Prowi-06, Germany) for 45 minutes. After a 2-hour waiting period, 1 mL neutralizing broth (Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth, Fluka) was transferred on the test surfaces, and samples were collected with a swab from the test surfaces and various surfaces in the testing room and inoculated on 5% sheep blood agar for incubation at 37oC for 24 hours. At the end of the incubation period, number of colonies were evaluated on the control and test plates. RESULTS: Although coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus spp., and fungi were grown in cultured samples obtained from the environment of experimental laboratory, no growth was observed in the test plates after room disinfection with Akacid Plus(R). After room disinfection, MRSA and A. baumannii were not detectable in the cultured media prepared from the test surfaces with or without albumin. The bacterial count for vancomyine-resistant E. faecium was reduced from 10(7) to 5x10(2) on surfaces without albumin and from 10(7) to 2.5x10(3) on surfaces with albumin. All test plates prepared from the surfaces in the control room showed abundant growth of the microorganism. CONCLUSION: The nebulization of Akacid plus(R) solution at a concentration of 0.5% proved to be an efficient means of disinfection for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms that cause hospital outbreaks and use of isolation measures.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - Update on linezolid in vitro activity through the Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program, 2013.
AB  - Linezolid showed MIC50s and MIC90s of 1 mug/ml (for both) against Staphylococcus  aureus. Two S. aureus strains exhibited higher MICs (4 to 8 mug/ml) caused by cfr and/or target site mutations, including the first detection of cfr in Poland. Linezolid (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.5 and 1 mug/ml) had potent MICs against coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Four CoNS had MICs of 16 to 128 mug/ml due to alterations in 23S rRNA and/or L3/L4. Linezolid inhibited all enterococci and streptococci at </=2 mug/ml, except for one Enterococcus faecium strain (MIC, 8 mug/ml; G2576T [Escherichia coli numbering] mutation).
TI  - Microbiological characterization of aquatic microbiomes targeting taxonomical marker genes and antibiotic resistance genes of opportunistic bacteria.
AB  - The dissemination of medically relevant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (blaVIM-1, vanA, ampC, ermB, and mecA) and opportunistic bacteria (Enterococcus faecium/faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, and CNS) was determined in different anthropogenically influenced aquatic habitats in a selected region of Germany. Over a period of two years, four differently sized wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with and without clinical influence, three surface waters, four rain overflow basins, and three groundwater sites were analyzed by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Results were calculated in cell equivalents per 100 ng of total DNA extracted from water samples and per 100 mL sample volume, which seems to underestimate the abundance of antibiotic resistance and opportunistic bacteria. High abundances of opportunistic bacteria and ARG were quantified in clinical wastewaters and influents of the adjacent WWTP. The removal capacities of WWTP were up to 99% for some, but not all investigated bacteria. The abundances of most ARG targets were found to be increased in the bacterial population after conventional wastewater treatment. As a consequence, downstream surface water and also some groundwater compartments displayed high abundances of all four ARGs. It became obvious that the dynamics of the ARG differed from the fate of the opportunistic bacteria. This underlines the necessity of an advanced microbial characterization of anthropogenically influenced environments.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 LEADER surveillance program.
AB  - The 2013 LEADER surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against Gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the United States. A total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. The groups were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. The MIC90 value for each of the 6 pathogen groups was 1 mug/mL. Susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was 99.83%. Only 12 isolates (2 S. aureus, 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Streptococcus sanguinis, 5 Enterococcus faecium, and 1 Enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). Three of these (2 S. aureus and 1 E. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. The findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.
TI  - Application of whole-genome sequencing for bacterial strain typing in molecular epidemiology.
AB  - Nosocomial infections pose a significant threat to patient health; however, the gold standard laboratory method for determining bacterial relatedness (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE]) remains essentially unchanged 20 years after its introduction. Here, we explored bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as an alternative approach for molecular strain typing. We compared WGS to PFGE for investigating presumptive outbreaks involving three important pathogens: vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (n=19), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=17), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=15). WGS was highly reproducible (average</=0.39 differences between technical replicates), which enabled a functional, quantitative definition for determining clonality. Strain relatedness data determined by PFGE and WGS roughly correlated, but the resolution of WGS was superior (P=5.6x10(-8) to 0.016). Several discordant results were noted between the methods. A total of 28.9% of isolates which were indistinguishable by PFGE were nonclonal by WGS. For A. baumannii, a species known to undergo rapid horizontal gene transfer, 16.2% of isolate pairs considered nonidentical by PFGE were clonal by WGS. Sequencing whole bacterial genomes with single-nucleotide resolution demonstrates that PFGE is prone to false-positive and false-negative results and suggests the need for a new gold standard approach for molecular epidemiological strain typing.
TI  - End group modification: Efficient tool for improving activity of antimicrobial peptide analogues towards Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Increased incidence of infections with multidrug-resistant bacterial strains warrants an intensive search for novel potential antimicrobial agents. Here, an antimicrobial peptide analogue with a cationic/hydrophobic alternating design displaying only moderate activity against Gram-positive pathogens was optimized. Generally, introduction of hydrophobic moieties at the N-terminus resulted in analogues with remarkably increased activity against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Interestingly, the potency against Escherichia coli strains was unaffected, whereas modification with hydrophobic moieties led to increased activity towards the Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii. Despite increased cytotoxicity against murine fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the optimized peptide analogues exhibited significantly improved cell selectivity. Overall, the most favorable hydrophobic activity-inducing moieties were found to be cyclohexylacetyl and pentafluorophenylacetyl groups, while the presence of a short PEG-like chain had no significant effect on activity. Introduction of cationic moieties conferred no effect or merely a moderate activity-promoting effect to the analogues.
TI  - Endophytic fungi: a reservoir of antibacterials.
AB  - Multidrug drug resistant bacteria are becoming increasingly problematic particularly in the under developed countries of the world. The most important microorganisms that have seen a geometric rise in numbers are Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium, Penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumonia and multiple drug resistant tubercule bacteria to name a just few. New drug scaffolds are essential to tackle this every increasing problem. These scaffolds can be sourced from nature itself. Endophytic fungi are an important reservoir of therapeutically active compounds. This review attempts to present some data relevant to the problem. New, very specific and effective antibiotics are needed but also at an affordable price! A Herculean task for researchers all over the world! In the Asian subcontinent indigenous therapeutics that has been practiced over the centuries such as Ayurveda have been effective as "handed down data" in family generations. May need a second, third and more "in-depth investigations?"
TI  - Update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of Gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - A revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Telavancin activity was assessed against Gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. A total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the Telavancin International Surveillance Program for the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/mL, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all Staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/mL (revised FDA breakpoint). Telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) and linezolid (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. All 692 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/mL) at </=0.25 mug/mL (FDA breakpoint), except for 1 strain (MIC, 0.5 mug/mL). All Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis with telavancin MIC values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/mL, respectively, had a VanA phenotype. A comparison data analysis based on the MIC90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. Streptococci showed telavancin MIC50 values of </=0.015 mug/mL, except for Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50, 0.03 mug/mL). These in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.
TI  - Antibiotic Resistance Prevalence in Routine Bloodstream Isolates from Children's  Hospitals Varies Substantially from Adult Surveillance Data in Europe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing AMR levels. It is unclear whether childhood AMR patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. METHODS: Resistance percentages of nonduplicate Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children (ARPEC) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. In addition, resistance percentages were compared between ARPEC isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. RESULTS: Resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for ARPEC isolates compared with EARS-Net. E. coli and K. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in ARPEC (13.4% and 17.9%) than in EARS-Net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in P. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in ARPEC, 19.3% in EARS-Net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in ARPEC and 20.5% in EARS-Net), and for S. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. For many Gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. CONCLUSIONS: Age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
TI  - In vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. Bacterial isolates from the 2013 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (DFI) and Gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. The MIC50 and MIC90 against all organisms tested from DFI were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MIC values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. Pexiganan MIC values among Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. Pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. Decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against S. aureus or E. faecium. Enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (MIC, 32 to 256 mug/ml). The "all organism" MIC90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
TI  - Detection of the classical G2576U mutation in linezolid resistant Staphylococcus  aureus along with isolation of linezolid resistant Enterococcus faecium from a patient on short-term linezolid therapy: first report from India.
AB  - PURPOSE: Linezolid is an effective drug against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We describe the emergence of linezolid resistance in MRSA and VRE from India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One MRSA and two VRE strains were isolated from a patient on linezolid therapy of one week duration. All three isolates were resistant to linezolid with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) >/=4 mg/L. The 746-bp region flanking the possible G2576U mutation on the corresponding DNA from the 23S rRNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplicons were sequenced for all the three isolates. Conjugation experiments using the linezolid resistant MRSA (LRMRSA) and linezolid resistant VRE (LRVRE) isolates as donors and wild strains of corresponding genera as recipients were performed. RESULTS: The MRSA isolate had the classical G2576U mutation. High quality value scores in the sequencing software validated the mutation. Conjugation studies did not indicate presence of transferable resistance for linezolid. Sequencing did not indicate presence of any mutation in the two LRVRE isolates. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report from India citing resistance in Staphylococcus and Enterococcus against Linezolid.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - The impact of hospital-acquired infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria in an oncology intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe overall site-specific hospital-acquired infection (HAI) rates and to describe the microbiological and antibiotic resistance profiles of infecting pathogens, together with their impact on multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria-associated mortality. METHODS: We conducted a 5-year retrospective descriptive study of HAI in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a cancer center in Mexico from January 2007 to December 2011. The following information was collected: patient characteristics and comorbidities, data related to the neoplasm and its treatment, microbiology, and the resistance pattern of all isolates. RESULTS: During the study period, 1418 patients were admitted to the ICU; 134 of them developed 159 infections, with an incidence of 11.2/100 hospitalized patients and 32.2/per 1000 patient-days. Two hundred sixty-six microorganisms were isolated. The overall prevalence of MDR-HAI was 39.5%. The most frequent organisms were as follows: 54 (20%) Escherichia coli (94.4% of these were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers), 32 (12%) Staphylococcus aureus (90.6% of these were methicillin-resistant), 32 (12%) Enterococcus faecium (18.7% of these were vancomycin-resistant), and 20 (6%) Acinetobacter baumannii (all were MDR). Among patients admitted to the ICU, 252 (17.8%) died. Death was related to the HAI in 58 (23%) of these patients (p<0.001) and 51 (88%) had a MDR organism isolated (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of MDR bacteria poses a difficult task for physicians, who have limited therapeutic options. Critically ill cancer patients admitted to the ICU are at major risk of a bacterial MDR-HAI that will impact adversely on mortality.
TI  - [Trends in antibiotic resistance in Medellin and municipalities of the Metropolitan Area between 2007 and 2012: Results of six years of surveillance].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in Medellin and its Metropolitan Area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using WHONET 5.6 program. For interpretation of susceptibility results, CLSI standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. Using the Epi-Info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). In Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in Klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and Enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). K. pneumoniae , S. marcescens and E. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii . CONCLUSIONS: The resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of E. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae . It is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
TI  - Risk factors for mortality in liver transplant recipients with ESKAPE infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infections caused by the pathogens Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp (ESKAPE) have recently been identified as serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant, no information in liver transplant (LT) recipients is available. We sought to investigate the risk factors for associated mortality in LT recipients with ESKAPE infections. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of infection after LT was reviewed. Risk factors for mortality caused by ESKAPE infection were identified. RESULTS: Fifty-three episodes of infections caused by ESKAPE were documented in 51 LT recipients. The main sites of infection were the bloodstream (49.0%), the lungs (33.3%), and the intra-abdominal/biliary tract (17.6%). The risk factors for mortality independently associated with ESKAPE infection were female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 6.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-40.8, P = .042), septic shock (OR = 30.1, 95% CI = 3.7-244.8, P = .001), and lymphocyte counts <300/mm(3) (OR = 20.2, 95% CI = 2.9-142.2, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: To improve the results of LT, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when female LT recipients with ESKAPE infection present with septic shock and decreased lymphocyte counts.
TI  - Removal of total and antibiotic resistant bacteria in advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation in combination with different filtering techniques.
AB  - Elimination of bacteria by ozonation in combination with charcoal or slow sand filtration for advanced sewage treatment to improve the quality of treated sewage and to reduce the potential risk for human health of receiving surface waters was investigated in pilot scale at the sewage treatment plant Eriskirch, Baden-Wuerttemberg/Germany. To determine the elimination of sewage bacteria, inflowing and leaving wastewater of different treatment processes was analysed in a culture-based approach for its content of Escherichia coli, enterococci and staphylococci and their resistance against selected antibiotics over a period of 17 month. For enterococci, single species and their antibiotic resistances were identified. In comparison to the established flocculation filtration at Eriskirch, ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration (pilot-scale) reduced the concentrations of total and antibiotic resistant E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci. However, antibiotic resistant E. coli and staphylococci apparently survived ozone treatment better than antibiotic sensitive strains. Neither vancomycin resistant enterococci nor methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were detected. The decreased percentage of antibiotic resistant enterococci after ozonation may be explained by a different ozone sensitivity of species: Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, which determined the resistance-level, seemed to be more sensitive for ozone than other Enterococcus-species. Overall, ozonation followed by charcoal or sand filtration led to 0.8-1.1 log-units less total and antibiotic resistant E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci, as compared to the respective concentrations in treated sewage by only flocculation filtration. Thus, advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration after common sewage treatment is an effective tool for further elimination of microorganisms from sewage before discharge in surface waters.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  - Current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. In line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated for their relative DNA binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. Encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against Gram-positive (including resistant MRSA, MRSE, VRE strains) and Gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. The bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with MIC of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of sensitive and resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest DNA binding affinity (DeltaTm of 15.4 degrees C). Asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. Molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with DNA, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. Herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial DNA binding agents.
TI  - Concentration-response studies and modelling of the pharmacodynamics of linezolid: Staphylococcus aureus versus Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - For assessing antibiotic effects, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) neglects that most antibiotics display different rates of bacterial killing. Time-kill curves, on the other hand, provide details on these killing rates but their interpretation is more complex and hardly standardised. The aim of the present study was to develop an analysis method to easily compare the pharmacodynamics of linezolid (LZD) against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium via in vitro time-kill curve experiments and to describe it by mathematical modelling. The effect of LZD against both organisms was investigated in a static in vitro infection model using 0.5-32.0 mug/mL LZD over 24h. LZD concentrations were quantified by a validated HPLC assay. A modified sigmoidal maximum effect (Emax) pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that accounts for time-dependent effects was developed in 'R'. As a continuous, growth-control-normalised pharmacodynamic measure, the relative bacterial reduction (RBR) was introduced and derived. LZD was more effective against S. aureus than against E. faecium (Emax 1.8-fold higher) at a comparable potency (EC50, 3.02 mug/mL vs. 1.80 mug/mL). The time delay of the maximum effect was predominantly observed within 6h of exposure. Model evaluation demonstrated its precision, robustness and predictive performance. In conclusion, the presented PK/PD analysis method provides quantitative measures (EC50, Emax) for the antibacterial drug effect as easy to interpret as point estimates, but more informative than the MIC since time- and concentration-dependent effects were considered. Application of the presented model developed as a flexible, robust tool in the free software 'R' appears promising.
TI  - [Recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: The bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of hyperimmune globulin preparations against multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing IgG (Intraglobin/Intratect) or a mixture of IgG, IgA, and IgM (Pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. The target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. RESULTS: All strains were killed to at least 50% by Pentaglobin. One P. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by Intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by Intraglobin to a similar degree compared to Pentaglobin. Opsonic IgG antibodies against E. faecalis were directed against LTA, while opsonic antibodies in Pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. In a mouse bacteremia model, Pentaglobin was more protective than Intratect against Staphylococcus aureus, while Intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. CONCLUSIONS: All tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Enrichment of these preparations with IgM increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.
TI  - Mechanisms of linezolid resistance in staphylococci and enterococci isolated from two teaching hospitals in Shanghai, China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is one of the most effective treatments against Gram-positive pathogens. However, linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains have recently emerged in worldwide. The purpose of this study was to analyse the prevalence and resistance mechanisms of linezolid-resistant/intermediate staphylococci and enterococci in Shanghai, China. RESULTS: Thirty-two linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains, including 14 Staphylococcus capitis, three Staphylococcus aureus, 14 Enterococcus faecalis and one Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates, were collected in this study which displayed linezolid MICs of 8 to 512 mug/ml, 8-32 mug/ml, 4-8 mug/ml and 4 mug/ml, respectively. All linezolid-resistant S. capitis isolates had a novel C2131T mutation and a G2603T mutation in the 23S rRNA region, and some had a C316T (Arg106Cys) substitution in protein L4 and/or harboured cfr. Linezolid-resistant S. aureus isolates carried a C389G (Ala130Gly) substitution in protein L3, and/or harboured cfr. The cfr gene was flanked by two copies of the IS256-like element, with a downstream orf1 gene. Linezolid-resistant/intermediate enterococci lacked major resistance mechanisms. The semi-quantitative biofilm assay showed that 14 linezolid-resistant E. faecalis isolates produced a larger biofilm than linezolid-susceptible E. faecalis strains. Transmission electron microscopy showed the cell walls of linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains were thicker than linezolid-susceptible strains. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that major resistance mechanisms, such as mutations in 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L3 and L4, along with cfr acquisition, played an important role in linezolid resistance. Secondary resistance mechanisms, such as biofilm formation and cell wall thickness, should also be taken into account.
TI  - Vancomycin revisited - 60 years later.
AB  - Vancomycin is one of the older antibiotics that has been now in clinical use close to 60 years. Earlier on, vancomycin was associated with many side effects including vestibular and renal, most likely due to impurities contained in early vancomycin lots. Over the years, the impurities have been removed and the compound has now far less vestibular adverse effects, but still possesses renal toxicity if administered at higher doses rendering trough serum levels of >15 mcg/mL or if administered for prolonged periods of time. Vancomycin is effective against most Gram-positive cocci and bacilli with the exception of rare organisms as well as enterococci that became vancomycin resistant, mostly Enterococcus faecium. The major use of vancomycin today is for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and amoxicillin-resistant enterococci. In its oral form, vancomycin is used to treat diarrhea caused by Clsotridium difficile. With S. aureus, there are only a handful of vancomycin-resistant strains. Nevertheless, a "vancomycin creep" that is slow upward trending of vancomycin MIC from <1 mcg/mL to higher values has been noted in several parts of the world, but not globally, and strains that have MIC's of 1.5-2 mcg/mL are associated with high therapeutic failure rates. This phenomenon has also been recently recognized in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). While vancomycin is relatively a safe agent adverse events include the "red man" syndrome, allergic reactions, and various bone marrow effects as well as nephrotoxicity. Vancomycin has been a very important tool in our therapeutic armamentarium that remained effective for many years, it is likely remain effective as long as resistance to vancomycin remains controlled.
TI  - Blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - Establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. A total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of two transplantation wards of a large hospital in Warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, France). The 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. The highest proportion were bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with Escherichia coli (61 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and Enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. The non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and Acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). Most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). Of 77 staphylococcal strains, 56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 Staphylococcus aureus. Other Gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). Obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). Among all Enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of S aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples, 2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. Both were Enterococcus faecium. Resistant strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.
TI  - Bacteriocin protein BacL1 of Enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes L-Ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  - Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, BacL1 and BacA. We previously reported that BacL1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kDa) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan D-isoglutamyl-L-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of E. faecalis when an accessory factor, BacA, is copresent. However, the target of BacL1 remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of BacL1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that BacL1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target E. faecalis cells. This specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the SH3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of BacL1. Repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of BacL1 and BacA. The static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting of BacL1 to the cell division-associated site. Furthermore, the targeting of BacL1 was detectable among Gram-positive bacteria with an L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including E. faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Listeria monocytogenes. These data suggest that BacL1 specifically targets the L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially lyses the E. faecalis cells during cell division.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in European and US hospitals (2010-13).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) in European and US hospitals. METHODS: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for SSTIs were included. Isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in Europe (Israel included) and the USA, respectively, between 2010 and 2013. RESULTS: Oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal MIC, MIC50 and MIC90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. CoNS from the USA (MIC50, 0.015 mg/L) demonstrated an MIC50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from Europe (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L). Overall, vancomycin-resistant (VanA-phenotype) Enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (MIC50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/L; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all VanA E. faecalis at </=0.5 mg/L. Equivalent oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/L) were noted for all VanB and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MICs (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L) were obtained for VanA strains. Oritavancin had low MICs against the overall populations of Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the Streptococcus anginosus group (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher MICs for Streptococcus dysgalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/L; >/=98.3% susceptible). CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of European and US isolates causing SSTIs. These results describe oritavancin activity against Gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the USA.
TI  - Baseline activity of telavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented infections in U.S. hospitals (2011-2012) as determined by the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml (100.0% susceptible), respectively, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Telavancin was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 100% susceptible) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), while higher MIC values were obtained against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/ml) and E. faecalis (MIC50/90, >2/>2 mug/ml). Streptococci showed telavancin modal MIC results of </= 0.015 mug/ml, except against Streptococcus agalactiae (i.e., 0.03 mug/ml). This study reestablishes the telavancin spectrum of activity against isolates recovered from the United States (2011-2012) using the revised broth microdilution method.
TI  - Membrane active phenylalanine conjugated lipophilic norspermidine derivatives with selective antibacterial activity.
AB  - Natural and synthetic membrane active antibacterial agents offer hope as potential solutions to the problem of bacterial resistance as the membrane-active nature imparts low propensity for the development of resistance. In this report norspermidine based antibacterial molecules were developed that displayed excellent antibacterial activity against various wild-type bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and drug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and beta-lactam-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae). In a novel structure-activity relationship study it has been shown how incorporation of an aromatic amino acid drastically improves selective antibacterial activity. Additionally, the effect of stereochemistry on activity, toxicity, and plasma stability has also been studied. These rapidly bactericidal, membrane active antibacterial compounds do not trigger development of resistance in bacteria and hence bear immense potential as therapeutic agents to tackle multidrug resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Synthetic teichoic acid conjugate vaccine against nosocomial Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTA) are amphiphilic polymers that are important constituents of the cell wall of many Gram-positive bacteria. The chemical structures of LTA vary among organisms, albeit in the majority of Gram-positive bacteria the LTAs feature a common poly-1,3-(glycerolphosphate) backbone. Previously, the specificity of opsonic antibodies for this backbone present in some Gram-positive bacteria has been demonstrated, suggesting that this minimal structure may be sufficient for vaccine development. In the present work, we studied a well-defined synthetic LTA-fragment, which is able to inhibit opsonic killing of polyclonal rabbit sera raised against native LTA from Enterococcus faecalis 12030. This promising compound was conjugated with BSA and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Subsequently, the opsonic activity of this serum was tested in an opsonophagocytic assay and specificity was confirmed by an opsonophagocytic inhibition assay. The conjugated LTA-fragment was able to induce specific opsonic antibodies that mediate killing of the clinical strains E. faecalis 12030, Enterococcus faecium E1162, and community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus strain MW2 (USA400). Prophylactic immunization with the teichoic acid conjugate and with the rabbit serum raised against this compound was evaluated in active and passive immunization studies in mice, and in an enterococcal endocarditis rat model. In all animal models, a statistically significant reduction of colony counts was observed indicating that the novel synthetic LTA-fragment conjugate is a promising vaccine candidate for active or passive immunotherapy against E. faecalis and other Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a quinuclidine-based FtsZ inhibitor and its synergistic potential with beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z (FtsZ) is an essential cell division protein that cooperates in the formation of the cytokinetic Z-ring in most bacteria and has thus been recognized as a promising antimicrobial drug target. We have recently used a structure-based virtual screening approach to identify pyrimidine-linked quinuclidines as a novel class of FtsZ inhibitors. In this study, we further investigated the antibacterial properties of one of the most potent compounds (quinuclidine 1) and its synergistic activity with beta-lactam antibiotics. Susceptibility results showed that quinuclidine 1 was active against multiple antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 24 mug ml(-1). When quinuclidine 1 was combined with beta-lactam antibiotics, synergistic antimicrobial activities against antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus were found. Further in vitro studies suggest that prevention of FtsZ protofilament formation by quinuclidine 1 impairs the formation of Z-ring, and thus inhibits bacterial division. These findings open a new approach for development of quinuclidine-based FtsZ inhibitors into potent antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Prevalence of antibacterial resistant bacterial contaminants from mobile phones of hospital inpatients.
AB  - Mobile phones contaminated with bacteria may act as fomites. Antibiotic resistant bacterial contamination of mobile phones of inpatients was studied. One hundred and six samples were collected from mobile phones of patients admitted in various hospitals in Jazan province of Saudi Arabia. Eighty-nine (83.9%) out of 106 mobile phones were found to be contaminated with bacteria. Fifty-two (49.0%) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 12 (11.3%) Staphylococcus aureus, 7 (6.6%) Enterobacter cloacae, 3 (2.83%) Pseudomonas stutzeri, 3 (2.83%) Sphingomonas paucimobilis, 2 (1.8%) Enterococcus faecalis and 10 (9.4%) aerobic spore bearers were isolated. All the isolated bacteria were found to be resistant to various antibiotics. Hence, regular disinfection of mobile phones of hospital inpatients is advised.
TI  - Selection of potential probiotic Enterococcus faecium isolated from Portuguese fermented food.
AB  - Four Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from fermented products were evaluated for potential use as probiotic strains. In addition to efaAfm gene, commonly found in E. faecium food isolates, none of the isolates possessed virulence genes and none had positive reactions for the production of tyramine, histamine, putrescine and cadaverine in the screening medium used. All of these four isolates proved to be resistant to 65 degrees C. E. faecium 119 did not show antimicrobial activity against any of the target bacteria investigated. E. faecium 85 and 101 inhibited Listeria innocua and E. faecium DSMZ 13590. The strain E. faecium 120 inhibited seven target bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes 7946, L. monocytogenes 7947, L. innocua 2030c, L. innocua NCTC 11286, E. faecium DSMZ 13590, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213) and was chosen as the representative to assess the ability to survive gastrointestinal tract passage simulation, as well as the protective role of two food matrices (skim milk and Alheira) during its passage. For both matrices used, no significant differences (p<0.05) were obtained between the types of digestion - quick and slow passage simulation. In the skim milk matrix the isolate was reduced to values below the detection limit of the enumeration technique by the end of the two digestions, in contrast to the Alheira matrix, for which isolate 120 showed a reduction of only ca. 1 log CFU/ml. The E. faecium strain 120 was shown to be a potential candidate for further investigations as a potential probiotic culture.
TI  - Evaluation of high-resolution melting curve analysis of ligation-mediated real-time PCR, a rapid method for epidemiological typing of ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter Species) pathogens.
AB  - A single-tube method, ligation-mediated real-time PCR high-resolution melt analysis (LMqPCR HRMA), was modified for the rapid typing of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE) pathogens. A 97% agreement (60/62 isolates) was achieved in comparison to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results, which indicates that LMqPCR HRMA is a rapid and accurate screening tool for monitoring nosocomial outbreaks.
TI  - Potential for reduction of streptogramin A resistance revealed by structural analysis of acetyltransferase VatA.
AB  - Combinations of group A and B streptogramins (i.e., dalfopristin and quinupristin) are "last-resort" antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Resistance to streptogramins has arisen via multiple mechanisms, including the deactivation of the group A component by the large family of virginiamycin O-acetyltransferase (Vat) enzymes. Despite the structural elucidation performed for the VatD acetyltransferase, which provided a general molecular framework for activity, a detailed characterization of the essential catalytic and antibiotic substrate-binding determinants in Vat enzymes is still lacking. We have determined the crystal structure of S. aureus VatA in apo, virginiamycin M1- and acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-bound forms and provide an extensive mutagenesis and functional analysis of the structural determinants required for catalysis and streptogramin A recognition. Based on an updated genomic survey across the Vat enzyme family, we identified key conserved residues critical for VatA activity that are not part of the O-acetylation catalytic apparatus. Exploiting such constraints of the Vat active site may lead to the development of streptogramin A compounds that evade inactivation by Vat enzymes while retaining binding to their ribosomal target.
TI  - Novel imidazoline antimicrobial scaffold that inhibits DNA replication with activity against mycobacteria and drug resistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Bacterial antimicrobial resistance is an escalating public health threat, yet the current antimicrobial pipeline remains alarmingly depleted, making the development of new antimicrobials an urgent need. Here, we identify a novel, potent, imidazoline antimicrobial compound, SKI-356313, with bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Gram-positive cocci, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). SKI-356313 is active in murine models of Streptococcus pneumoniae and MRSA infection and is potently bactericidal for both replicating and nonreplicating M. tuberculosis. Using a combination of genetics, whole genome sequencing, and a novel target ID approach using real time imaging of core macromolecular biosynthesis, we show that SKI-356313 inhibits DNA replication and displaces the replisome from the bacterial nucleoid. These results identify a new antimicrobial scaffold with a novel mechanism of action and potential therapeutic utility against nonreplicating M. tuberculosis and antibiotic resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. The current study was performed in order to test the influence of different AST standards on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption. METHODS: Automated AST was performed with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. From each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and MIC data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by DIN and EUCAST, respectively. In addition cumulative AST data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new EUCAST MIC breakpoints. RESULTS: The susceptibility rate of P. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of C. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of E. cloacae, S. marcescens, and M. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from DIN to EUCAST MIC breakpoints. These changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of EUCAST MIC breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that changes of AST breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - Frequency and clinical outcomes of ESKAPE bacteremia in solid organ transplantation and the risk factors for mortality.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although bacteremias caused by the 6 ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (SOT), more information is urgently needed. We sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of ESKAPE bacteremia in SOT and determine the risk factors for mortality. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of bacteremia after SOT was reviewed. Risk factors for mortality caused by ESKAPE bacteremia were identified. RESULTS: Eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by ESKAPE strains. Of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant ESKAPE (rESKAPE) organisms. The only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with ESKAPE was septic shock (odds ratio [OR] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.038-87.682, P < 0.001). The factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were septic shock (OR = 16.558, 95% CI = 6.620-104.668, P = 0.003) and age >/=40 years (OR = 7.521, 95% CI = 1.196-47.292, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: To improve the outcomes of transplantation, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when older SOT recipients with bacteremia due to ESKAPE/rESKAPE organisms present with septic shock.
TI  - Bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  - The ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. Fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. Experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. A specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. Much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. The use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial maximum non-inhibitory and minimum inhibitory concentrations of different water activity depressing solutes.
AB  - The NaCl MNICs (maximum non-inhibitory concentrations) and MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) for growth of various strains of six bacterial species were determined and then compared with those obtained for seven other solutes. The influence of prior growth conditions on the MNICs and MICs was also evaluated. No significant changes on the MNICs and MICs were found among the strains studied within each species. Among all factors investigated, only growth phase -for Gram-negatives- and growth at high NaCl concentrations led to a change in the NaCl MNICs. Species could be classified depending on its NaCl MNICs and MICs (in decreasing order) as follows: Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium. Similar results were obtained for KCl, LiCl, and sodium acetate, but not for the remaining solutes investigated (sucrose, glycerol, MgCl2 and CaCl2). Results obtained indicate that, in general, Gram-negatives showed lower MNICs and MICs than Gram-positives for all the solutes, S. aureus being the most solute tolerant microorganism. When compared on a molar basis, glycerol showed the highest MNICs and MICs for all the microorganisms -except for S. aureus- and LiCl the lowest ones. NaCl MNICs and MICs were not significantly different from those of KCl when compared on a molar basis. Therefore, the inhibitory action of NaCl could not be linked to the specific action of Na(+). Results also showed that the Na(+) tolerance of some species was Cl(-) dependent whereas for others it was not, and that factors others than aw-decrease contribute to the inhibitory action of LiCl, CaCl2 and MgCl2.
TI  - Transformation of human cathelicidin LL-37 into selective, stable, and potent antimicrobial compounds.
AB  - This Letter reports a family of novel antimicrobial compounds obtained by combining peptide library screening with structure-based design. Library screening led to the identification of a human LL-37 peptide resistant to chymotrypsin. This d-amino-acid-containing peptide template was active against Escherichia coli but not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It possesses a unique nonclassic amphipathic structure with hydrophobic defects. By repairing the hydrophobic defects, the peptide (17BIPHE2) gained activity against the ESKAPE pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species. In vitro, 17BIPHE2 could disrupt bacterial membranes and bind to DNA. In vivo, the peptide prevented staphylococcal biofilm formation in a mouse model of catheter-associated infection. Meanwhile, it boosted the innate immune response to further combat the infection. Because these peptides are potent, cell-selective, and stable to several proteases, they may be utilized to combat one or more ESKAPE pathogens.
TI  - [Identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  MALDI-TOF MS system].
AB  - Bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time- of- Flight Mass Spectrometry) system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MALDI-TOF MS system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. A total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by Gram stain were evaluated. These blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between December 2013-February 2014. Conventional methods and BD Phoenix automated bacterial identification system (Becton Dickinson, USA) were used for routine identification. The strains were also identified by real-time Taqman PCR (qPCR) which was considered as the reference method. In MALDI-TOF MS method, MALDI Sepsityper Kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using Microflex LT instrument and FlexControl 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, 90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qPCR, BD Phoenix, Bruker MALDI-TOF MS). The other six samples were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both Phoenix and the MALDI-TOF systems. Of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at the species level (15 S.aureus, 33 S.epidermidis, 29 S.hominis, 10 S.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qPCR method. When comparing the results obtained by qPCR and Bruker MALDI-TOF MS, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. Those isolates were identified as S.hominis by qPCR, however two of them were identified as S.haemolyticus and one as S.epidermidis by MALDI-TOF MS. Compared with real-time Taqman PCR it was detected that Bruker MALDI TOF MS was identified 100% of S.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) to the genus and species level, respectively. In conclusion, it was thought that Bruker MALDI TOF MS system may allow rapid and reliable identification of S.aureus and CNS directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Increase in the Prevalence of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Isolates and Ampicillin-Resistant Non-Typhoidal Salmonella Species in Korea: A KONSAR Study Conducted in 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a forum for rational drug development. In this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program (KONSAR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. Data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and those admitted to other wards were compared. Intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin G-non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VR-EFM) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. Resistance rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of Acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. The prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa, MRSA, and VR-EFM among ICU isolates was higher than those among non-ICU isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, and VR-EFM were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. Resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24% and 8% in 2011, respectively. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. The proportion of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MRSA, penicillin G-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant E. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. Multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from ICUs. The prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant K. pneumoniae and amikacin-resistant P. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water.
AB  - AIM: Super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. There are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as high level disinfectant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, super-oxidized water obtained from Medilox(R) [Soosan E & C, Korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. Antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) against six ATCC strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth [Sigma-Aldrich, USA] was used as neutralizing agent. RESULTS: Medilox(R) was found to be effective against all standard strains (Acinetobacter baumannii 19606, Escherichia coli 25922, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in >/=1 minute. It was found to be effective on Aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in >/=2 minutes and on certain molds in >/=5 minutes. CONCLUSION: Medilox(R) super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.
TI  - Comparative study of prescribing patterns of tigecycline for trial patients versus non-trial patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparing published trial patients and non-trial patients in clinical practice, clinicians often doubt whether critically ill patients are sufficiently represented in randomised clinical trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study evaluated the extent of infection with multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, anti-microbial combination therapy, off-label use and targeted-treatment in trial patients versus non-trial patients. RESULTS: Tigecycline therapy was prescribed for off-label use in more than half of the non-trial patients; 77% of trial patients received study medication as first-line therapy in contrast to 25% of non-trial patients (p<0.001). Tigecycline therapy was targeted for 27% of trial patients versus 73% of non-trial patients (p<0.001). Ninety-six percent of non-trial patients were treated for nosocomial infections compared to 23% of trial patients (p<0.001). In one out of 22 (4.5%) trial patients an ESKAPE pathogen was found, whereas rates of vancomycin- resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended spectrum-beta lactamase- producing Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 13/165 (8%) and 23/165 (14%) for non-trial patients. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline was used for less critical populations in clinical trials than in clinical practice. Our findings confirm the particular need of potent substances such as tigecycline for critically ill patients.
TI  - A broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. Their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. Here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens. Combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature P. aeruginosa biofilms. In addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced P. aeruginosa PA14 preexisting biofilms. PCR studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. Thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Genome Sequences of Two Carbapenemase-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 Isolates.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae, an ESKAPE group (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogen, has acquired multiple antibiotic resistance genes and is becoming a serious public health threat. Here, we report the genome sequences of two representative strains of K. pneumoniae from the emerging K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) outbreak in northeast Ohio belonging to sequence type 258 (ST258) (isolates Kb140 and Kb677, which were isolated from blood and urine, respectively). Both isolates harbor a blaKPC gene, and strain Kb140 carries blaKPC-2, while Kb677 carries blaKPC-3.
TI  - Isolation and structure elucidation of cystargamide, a lipopeptide from Kitasatospora cystarginea.
AB  - A new lipopeptide, cystargamide (1) was isolated from the fermentation broth of the actinomycete Kitasatospora cystarginea. The bacterial strain was selected from a set of 12 Kitasatospora spp. using a secondary metabolomics approach combining liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) with principal component analysis (PCA). Cystargamide (1) was purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and the structure elucidation was achieved by interpreting mass spectrometry and NMR data. Cystargamide (1) contains rare structural features including a 5-hydroxy tryptophan residue and a 2,3-epoxydecanoyl fatty acid group.
TI  - Polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride shows bactericidal advantages over chlorhexidine digluconate against ESKAPE bacteria.
AB  - More information regarding the bactericidal properties of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (PHMG) against clinically important antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens needs to be provided for its uses in infection control. The bactericidal properties of PHMG and chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG) were compared based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations, and time-course-killing curves against clinically important antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE pathogens. Results showed that PHMG exhibited significantly higher bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter spp. than CHG. A slight bactericidal advantage over CHG was obtained against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, ciprofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant Acinetobacter spp., and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In previous reports, PHMG had higher antimicrobial activity against almost all tested Gram-negative bacteria and several Gram-positive bacteria than CHG using MIC test. These studies support the further development of covalently bound PHMG in sterile-surface materials and the incorporation of PHMG in novel disinfectant formulas.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.
AB  - Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.
TI  - Daptomycin is safe and effective for the treatment of gram-positive cocci infections in solid organ transplantation.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci (GPC), especially to glycopeptides, are difficult to treat in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients as a result of lower effectiveness and high rates of renal impairment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of daptomycin in this population. METHODS: Over a 2-year period (March 2008-2010) in 9 Spanish centers, we enrolled all consecutive recipients who received daptomycin to treat GPC infection. The study included 43 patients, mainly liver and kidney transplant recipients. RESULTS: The most frequent infections were catheter-related bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (23.2%), skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus (11.5%), and intra-abdominal abscess caused by Enterococcus faecium (20.9%). The daily daptomycin dose was 6 mg/kg in 32 patients (74.4%). On day 7 of daptomycin treatment, median estimated area under the curve was 1251 mug/mL/h. At the end of follow-up, analytical parameters were similar to the values at the start of therapy. No changes were observed in tacrolimus levels. No patient required discontinuation of daptomycin because of adverse effects. Clinical success at treatment completion was achieved in 37 (86%) patients. Three patients died while on treatment with daptomycin. CONCLUSION: In summary, daptomycin was a safe and useful treatment for GPC infection in SOT recipients.
TI  - Eliciting antibiotics active against the ESKAPE pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils.
AB  - The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. In recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. Here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the Himalaya and Qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against MDR pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. Using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes were identified - predominantly Streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the MDR clinical isolates referred to as ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Enterobacter cloacae. Antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not described previously. Our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific pathogen.
TI  - Ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel from 2005 to 2010.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in Europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia but including ventilated HAP patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent Gram-positive and -negative pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel during 2005 through 2010. A total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were collected from 33 medical centers. Species identification was confirmed, and all isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with MIC90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant CoNS, having a MIC90 of 2 mug/ml. Ceftobiprole was active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most Enterococcus faecium isolates. Ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80% inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. The potency of ceftobiprole against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at MIC values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (MIC50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. High activity was also observed against all Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. Ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.
TI  - Microbiological spectrum and antibiotic sensitivity in endophthalmitis: a 25-year review.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the spectrum and susceptibility pattern of pathogens responsible for culture-positive endophthalmitis referred to a single institution and investigate possible trends in both pathogens and antibiotic sensitivities over the past 25 years. DESIGN: A retrospective, laboratory-based study of consecutive microbiological isolates. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 988 consecutive culture-positive endophthalmitis isolates from 911 eyes. METHODS: All culture-positive endophthalmitis isolates collected from 1987 to 2011 were identified. Susceptibility rates to a variety of antibiotics were calculated. Chi-square test for trend was used to detect changes in spectrum or susceptibility over time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microbial spectrum and susceptibility pattern over time. RESULTS: A total of 988 isolates were identified from 911 eyes. The average patient age was 67 +/- 18 years, and 55% of the patients were female. The most prevalent pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (39.4%), followed by Streptococcus viridans species (12.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (11.1%). Gram-negative organisms and fungi accounted for 10.3% and 4.6% of all isolates, respectively. With the exception of 2 isolates, Enterococcus faecium and Nocardia exalbida, all the other 725 (99.7%) gram-positive bacteria tested were susceptible to vancomycin. Of the 94 gram-negative organisms tested against ceftazidime, 2 were of intermediate sensitivity and 6 were resistant. For 8 antibiotics, increasing microbial resistance over time was observed: cefazolin (P = 0.02), cefotetan (P = 0.006), cephalothin (P<0.0001), clindamycin (P = 0.04), erythromycin (P<0.0001), methicillin/oxacillin (P<0.0001), ampicillin (P = 0.01), and ceftriaxone (P = 0.006). For 3 antibiotics, increasing microbial susceptibility was observed: gentamicin (P<0.0001), tobramycin (P = 0.005), and imipenem (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Coagulase-negative staphylococcus remains the most frequently identified cause of endophthalmitis. Vancomycin and ceftazidime seem to be excellent empiric antibiotics for treating endophthalmitis. Although a statistically significant trend toward increasing microbial resistance against a variety of antibiotics, including cephalosporins and methicillin, was observed, a significant trend toward decreasing microbial resistance against aminoglycosides and imipenem also was detected.
TI  - High inhibition of Paenibacillus larvae and Listeria monocytogenes by Enterococcus isolated from different sources in Tunisia and identification of their bacteriocin genes.
AB  - A total of 300 isolates of Enterococcus, from different sources including faeces  of poultry, cow and sheep, raw milk, ricotta cheese and water, in Tunisia, were screened for their antibacterial activity. Amongst them, 59 bacteriocin-producing strains were detected and identified by molecular methods. Genes encoding for entA, entP, entB, entL50A/B, AS-48 and bac31 bacteriocins were targeted by PCR. The bacteriocin-producing strains were assigned to the species Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus mundtii and Enterococcus durans, respectively, 34, 19, 3, 2 and 1 isolates. Antimicrobial activity was specifically observed against different spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Paenibacillus larvae. The inhibitory activity was totally lost after proteinase K treatment, thereby revealing the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound. Only three bacteriocin genes, namely entP, entA and entL50A/B were detected in the isolates included in this study. Enterocins A and P were the most frequent genes and they were found in 55 (93.2%) and 39 isolates (66.1%), respectively, followed by enterocin L50A/B present in 27 isolates (45.7%). These newly identified bacteriocin-producing enterococci have the potential to be used in bio-preservation of food as well as biological control of foulbrood disease. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Enterococci possess interesting properties not only for the food industry, but also for animal and human health. The antimicrobial potential of these bacteria includes principally bacteriocin-like molecules. With the aim of identifying bacteriocinogenic strains, a collection of 300 enterococci isolated from different origins were screened and their spectrum of action, as well as the gene encoding the bacteriocin, was determined. Fifty-nine bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus showed high activity against Listeria monocytogenes and Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of American foulbrood. Enterocins A, P and L50A/B were found in various combinations. The most important finding of this study is the growth inhibition of P. larvae due to bacteriocin-producing Enterococcus, which opens up the possibility to use these strains to control the disease in honeybees.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium active dimeric isobutyrylphloroglucinol from Ivesia gordonii.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of the chloroform soluble fraction of stem, leaf, and flower extracts of the American plant Ivesia gordonii led to the isolation of a new dimeric acylphloroglucinol, 3,3'-diisobutyryl-2,6'-dimethoxy-4,6,2',4'-tetrahydroxy-5,5'dimethyldiphenyl methane (1), to which we have assigned the trivial name ofivesinol (1), together with a known monomeric acylphloroglucinol, 1,5-dihydroxy-2-(2'-methylpropionyl)-3-methoxy-6-methylbenzene (2). The structures of the isolated compounds were characterized using 1D- and 2D- NMR spectroscopy, including COSY, HMQC, HMBC, and ROESYexperiments, as well as mass spectrometry. Ivesinol (1) showed potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with IC50/MIC/MBC values of 0.10/1.25/>20 microg/mL and 0.05/0.31/>20 microg/mL, respectively (vs. IC50/MIC/MBC 0.13/0.5/1.0 microg/mL and 0.13/0.5/1.0 microg/mL of ciprofloxacin), while the corresponding monomer 2 was found to be less active. Compound 1 also demonstrated strong activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) with IC50/MlC/MBC values of 0.22/1.25/>20 microg/mL, whereas the reference standard ciprofloxacin was found to be inactive against this strain. In addition, compound 2 showed moderate activity against two species of Candida and Cryptococcus neoformans, while 1 was inactive against these fungi. In order to evaluate the influence of the acyl group(s) in phloroglucinol (3) as a ligand, the mono- (4) and diacetylphloroglucinol (5) were prepared from 3, and evaluated for their in vitro SA, MRSA, and VRE activities; 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (5) showed potent activity, like 1, against SA, MRSA, and VRE (ATCC 700221) with IC50/MIC values of 0.3/2.5, 0.23/2.5, and 0.86/2.5 microg/mL, respectively, while 4 was inactive.
TI  - Synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity evaluations of novel pyrazole carboxylic and dicarboxylic acid derivatives.
AB  - A series of pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and pyrazole-3,4-dicarboxylic acid derivatives were synthesized, the structures were confirmed by their NMR ((1)H and (13)C) and FT-IR spectra, and elemental analyses. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds against five bacterial and five fungal pathogens were screened using modified agar well diffusion assay. Most of the molecules have inhibitory effects on both standard and clinical Candida albicans strains. However, only the molecules 8, 10, 21, and 22 demonstrate some inhibitory effects on Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata strains. The structure-antifungal activity relationships of the compounds on the C. albicans strains were investigated by electron-conformational method. The pharmacophores and antipharmacophores responsible for the inhibition and non-inhibition of the C. albicans strains were obtained by electronic and geometrical characteristics of the reactive fragments of the molecules. These fragments along with the associated parameters can be used in designing the future more potent antifungal agents. It has been shown that both the positions of electronegative atoms like F and O in the pyrazole substituents and the amount of the associated charges on such atoms are crucial in regulating the strength of antifungal activity for the C. albicans strain.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of quaternary ammonium salt-type agents containing cholesterol and terpenes.
AB  - New quaternary ammonium salt-type compounds with lipophilic cholesterol and terpene moieties were synthesized. The compounds showed promising antibacterial and antimycobacterial activities. Those compounds containing the cholesterol moiety showed significant activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecium. On the contrary, the antimycobacterial activity increased with the presence of the terpene unit in the molecule.
TI  - Systematic evaluation of commercial susceptibility testing methods for determining the in vitro activity of daptomycin versus Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococci.
AB  - We systematically evaluated 5 methods for testing daptomycin versus 48 Enterococcus faecalis, 51 Enterococcus faecium, and 50 Staphylococcus aureus isolates using (i and ii) broth microdilution (BMD) with 50-mg/liter calcium medium supplementation (reference method) and 30-mg/liter calcium medium supplementation (BMD30 method), (iii) Etest, and (iv and v) MicroScan panel 33 using 2 methods to prepare the bacterial inoculum (MicroScan turbidity and MicroScan Prompt). Isolates were categorized as susceptible (S) or nonsusceptible (NS) based on measured MICs. Essential (+/- 1 dilution) agreement (EA) and categorical (S/NS) agreement (CA) for each method were compared to the reference method. For E. faecium, categorical agreement was poor between the reference method and BMD30 as well as with the three commercial methods, with frequent false-NS results (30 for BMD30, 18 for Etest, 22 for MicroScan Prompt, and 25 for MicroScan turbidity). All E. faecalis isolates were judged to be S by the reference method; two of these isolates were categorized as NS using the BMD30 method, and one was categorized as NS by all three commercial methods. All S. aureus isolates were judged to be S using all five methods. MIC values determined by the comparator methods tended to be higher than those for the reference method, especially for E. faecium isolates. EAs between the reference BMD and BMD30, Etest, MicroScan Prompt, and MicroScan turbidity were 63%, 63%, 63%, and 56%, respectively, for E. faecium, 87%, 83%, 98%, and 80%, respectively, for E. faecalis, and all 100% for S. aureus.
TI  - Daptomycin activity tested against 164457 bacterial isolates from hospitalised patients: summary of 8 years of a Worldwide Surveillance Programme (2005-2012).
AB  - We report the results of 8 years (2005-2012) of the Daptomycin Surveillance Programme Worldwide. Consecutive non-duplicate bacterial isolates (prevalence design) were collected from patients with documented infections in 410 medical centres and were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 164457 Gram-positive isolates were evaluated, including 97542 Staphylococcus aureus, 21413 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 29619 enterococci and 15883 beta-haemolytic streptococci. The prevalence of daptomycin-non-susceptible isolates was extremely low for all species in all geographic regions. Overall, the highest occurrence of non-susceptible isolates was observed among CoNS (0.19%), followed by Enterococcus faecium (0.18%), S. aureus (0.05%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.02%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (0.00%). Moreover, no trend towards increased daptomycin resistance (non-susceptibility) was observed for any species in any geographic region during the study interval. Against S. aureus, the daptomycin MIC(50/90) was 0.25/0.5 mg/L in all geographic regions (99.95% susceptible overall). Only 53 daptomycin-non-susceptible S. aureus isolates were observed and the vast majority (49; 92.5%) had a daptomycin MIC value only 1 log(2) dilution above the published susceptible breakpoint. Daptomycin was also active against CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/L; 99.81% susceptible), E. faecalis (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/L; 99.98% susceptible), E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 2/4 mg/L; 99.82% susceptible) including vancomycin-non-susceptible isolates (4521 isolates; MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/L; 99.76% susceptible), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible). In conclusion, daptomycin has remained very active against indicated species worldwide, and no significant year-to-year or regional variation in daptomycin activity has been detected.
TI  - Secondary bacteremia in rotavirus gastroenteritis.
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of secondary bacteremia in children with rotavirus gastroenteritis and persistence or reemergence of fever. We identified 376 children with a mean of age of 14.2 +/- 10.1 months. A significant pathogen was isolated from blood cultures in 5 patients [Enterococcus faecium (n = 1), Klebsiella spp (n = 1), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Raoultella planticola (n = 1), Candida albicans (n = 1); 1.3%]. The frequency of secondary bacteremia in children with rotavirus gastroenteritis is low, but it should be considered when there is fever lasting >48 hours or reemergence of fever.
TI  - Insufficient discriminatory power of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for typing of Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus isolates.
AB  - MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is increasingly used as a reliable technique for species identification of bacterial pathogens. In this study we investigated the question of whether MALDI-TOF MS can be used for accurate sub-differentiation of strains and isolates of two important nosocomial pathogens Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. For this purpose, a selection of 112 pre-characterized E. faecium isolates (clonal complexes CC2, CC5, CC9, CC17, CC22, CC25, CC26, CC92 altogether 52 multilocus sequence types) and 59 diverse S. aureus isolates (mostly methicillin resistant; CC5, CC8, CC22, CC30, CC45, CC398) were studied using a combination of MALDI-TOF MS and advanced methods of spectral data analysis. The strategy of MS data evaluation included manual peak inspection on the basis of pseudo gel views, unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis and supervised artificial neural network (ANN) analysis. We were capable of differentiating patterns of hospital-associated E. faecium isolates (CC17) from other strains of E. faecium with 87% accuracy, but failed to identify lineage-specific biomarker peaks. For S. aureus pattern analyses we were able to confirm a number of signals described in previous studies, but often failed to identify biomarkers that would allow a consistent and reliable identification of phylogenetic lineages, clonal complexes or sequence types. Hence, the discriminatory power of MALDI-TOF MS was found to be insufficient for reliably sub-differentiating E. faecium and S. aureus isolates to the level of distinct clones or clonal complexes, such as assessed by MLST. Further, a comparison between peak patterns of susceptible and resistant isolates did not identify statistically relevant marker peaks linked to glycopeptide resistance determinants (vanA, vanB) in E. faecium, or the methicillin resistance determinant (mecA) in S. aureus.
TI  - Haloemodin as novel antibacterial agent inhibiting DNA gyrase and bacterial topoisomerase I.
AB  - Drug-resistant bacterial infections and lack of available antibacterial agents in clinical practice are becoming serious risks to public health. We synthesized a new class of haloemodins by modifying a traditional Chinese medicine component, emodin. The novel haloemodin exerts strong inhibitory activity on bacterial topoisomerase I and DNA gyrase, and not on the topoisomerases of human origin. In principle, it shows remarkable antibacterial activities against laboratory and clinically isolated Gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We further expanded its antibacterial spectrum into against Gram-negative bacteria with the assistance of polymyxin B nonapeptide, which helps haloemodin to penetrate through the bacterial outer membrane. Finally, the therapeutic effect of haloemodin in vivo was confirmed in curing S. aureus-induced keratitis on rabbit model. With distinctive structural difference from the antibiotics we used, the haloemodins are of value as promising antibacterial pharmacophore, especially for combat the infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Daptomycin-loaded polymethylmethacrylate bone cement for joint arthroplasty surgery.
AB  - Antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement has been frequently used as an infection prophylaxis or antibiotic-loaded spacer in infected arthroplasty. In addition, daptomycin has been used recently against broad spectrum Gram-positive organisms. The goal of this in vitro study is to investigate the bacteriacidal and mechanical properties of daptomycin-incorporated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement and evaluate its feasibility for clinical use. Daptomycin (0.5, 1, or 2 g) was premixed with 40 g of PMMA bone cement powder before curing. The mechanical properties of the daptomycin-loaded acrylic bone cement (DLABC) were estimated following standard guidance, and the release profile and kinetics of daptomycin from PMMA were analyzed. The antimicrobial efficacy of DLABC was determined with a zone of inhibition (ZOI) assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. The results showed that the compressive strength, of PMMA bone cement, which was higher than 100 MPa in all groups, was sufficient according to ISO 5833 after incorporation of daptomycin. The encapsulated daptomycin was released for 2 weeks with a 9.59 +/- 0.85%, 15.25 +/- 0.69%, and 20.64 +/- 20.33% released percentage on the first day in the low, mid, and high groups, respectively. According to the calculated release kinetics, incorporated daptomycin should be 3.3 times the original dose to double its release. Although all recipes of DLABC had a microbial inhibitory effect, the effect with a higher encapsulated amount of daptomycin was more significant. Therefore, we believe that daptomycin can be locally delivered from PMMA bone cement at the surgical site as a prophylactic or treatment for osteomyelitis against Gram-positive organisms with intact cement function.
TI  - Spiromastixones A-O, antibacterial chlorodepsidones from a deep-sea-derived Spiromastix sp. fungus.
AB  - Fifteen new depsidone-based analogues named spiromastixones A-O (1-15) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep-sea Spiromastix sp. fungus. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. Spiromastixones A-O are classified into two subtypes based on the orientation of ring C relative to ring A, while the n-propyl substituents on rings A and C are rarely seen in natural products. Most analogues are substituted by various numbers of chlorine atoms. All compounds exhibited significant inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values ranging from 0.125 to 8.0 mug/mL. In addition, compounds 6-10 displayed potent inhibitory effects against methicillin-resistant bacterial strains of S. aureus (MRSA) and S. epidermidis (MRSE), while 10 also inhibited the growth of the vancomycin-resistant bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (VRE). The structure-activity relationships are discussed.
TI  - Plantaricin LD1: a bacteriocin produced by food isolate of Lactobacillus plantarum LD1.
AB  - Plantaricin LD1, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LD1, was characterized for biochemical and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocin showed stability at high temperatures (100 degrees C for 20 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure), in a pH range of 2.0-8.0 and also in the presence of organic solvents, surfactants and detergents. The crude preparation was not affected by catalase, amylase and lipase but activity was reduced in the presence of pepsin, trypsin and proteinase K showing proteinaceous nature of the compound. The molecular weight of bacteriocin was found to be approximately 6.5 kDa, and antimicrobial activity was confirmed by bioassay. It inhibited not only related strains but also other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as Lactobacillus curvatus NRRL B-4562, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis NRRL B-1821, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, Enterobacter cloacae NRRL B-14298, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, urogenic Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Vibrio sp. These properties of plantaricin LD1 suggest its applications not only in food safety but in therapeutics as well.
TI  - Etiology of peritonitis.
AB  - AIM: To determine the etiology of peritonitis, as well as the sensitivity of isolated bacteria to antibiotics. METHODS: Study was performed at the Surgical Clinic, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Department of Microbiology, Department of Clinical Pharmacology of University Clinical Centre (UCC) Tuzla. In a prospective study, starting from 1.6.2009. to 30.6.2010., was 60 patients analyzed who underwent surgery for acute peritonitis in the Surgical Clinic, UCC Tuzla. RESULTS: After microbiological processing of the content of the operative field, wound swabs and smears of drainage, we isolated Gram positive coccid bacteria: Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 18.36%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12.6%, while Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecum were found in 3.44% isolates. In the group of Gram-negative bacteria we isolated: Escherichia coli in 15.51%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 10.34% of the cases. The sensitivity of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was largest to vancomycin (100%), and lowest to penicillin (10%) and Staphylococcus aureus sensitivity was largest to vancomycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate (100%) and lowest to penicillins (3.7%). Sensitivity of the facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli was highest to carbapenems 95-100%, and lowest to penicillin preparations 0-56%. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of microbiological findings of 83.33% patients empirical antibiotic therapy was appropriately involved, and in 16.67% was inadequate and later changed, following the results of microbiological findings. This study indicates the importance and validity of microbiological diagnostics to determine the etiology of peritonitis and appropriate selection of antibiotics to treat these infections, with the required surgical treatment.
TI  - Small molecular antibacterial peptoid mimics: the simpler the better!
AB  - The emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria compounded by the depleting arsenal of antibiotics has accelerated efforts toward development of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. In this report, we present a series of small molecular antibacterial peptoid mimics which exhibit high in vitro potency against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including drug-resistant species such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The highlight of these compounds is their superior activity against the major nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Nontoxic toward mammalian cells, these rapidly bactericidal compounds primarily act by permeabilization and depolarization of bacterial membrane. Synthetically simple and selectively antibacterial, these compounds can be developed into a newer class of therapeutic agents against multidrug resistant bacterial species.
TI  - Performance of Vitek 2 for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Vitek 2 (bioMerieux, Inc., Durham, NC) is a widely used commercial antimicrobial  susceptibility testing system. We compared MIC results obtained by Vitek 2 to those obtained by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution (BMD) reference method for 134 staphylococcal and 84 enterococcal clinical isolates. Nineteen agents were evaluated, including all those available on Vitek 2 for testing staphylococci and enterococci. The resistance phenotypes tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 58), S. aureus with inducible clindamycin resistance (ICR) (n = 30), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant MRSA (n = 10), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (n = 37), high-level gentamicin-resistant Enterococcus (n = 15), linezolid-resistant Enterococcus (n = 5), and daptomycin-nonsusceptible Enterococcus faecalis (n = 6). For the staphylococci, there was 98.9% categorical agreement (CA). There was one very major error (VME) for gentamicin in a Staphylococcus hominis isolate, six VMEs for inducible clindamycin in S. aureus isolates, and two major errors (ME) for daptomycin in an S. aureus and a Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate. For enterococci, there was 97.3% CA. Two VMEs were observed for daptomycin in isolates of E. faecalis and 2 ME, 1 for high-level gentamicin resistance and 1 for nitrofurantoin, in E. faecium isolates. Overall, there was 98.3% CA and 99% essential agreement for the testing of staphylococci and enterococci by the Vitek 2. With the exception of detecting ICR in S. aureus, Vitek 2 performed reliably for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci.
TI  - Evaluation of epidemiological cut-off values indicates that biocide resistant subpopulations are uncommon in natural isolates of clinically-relevant microorganisms.
AB  - To date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. As a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) distributions for four common biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on Staphylococcus aureus (N = 1635) and Salmonella spp. (N = 901) but also including Escherichia coli (N = 368), Candida albicans (N = 200), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 60), Enterobacter spp. (N = 54), Enterococcus faecium (N = 53), and Enterococcus faecalis (N = 56). From these data epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) are proposed. As would be expected, MBCs were higher than MICs for all biocides. In most cases both values followed a normal distribution. Bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for Enterobacter chlorhexidine susceptibility (both MICs and MBCs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of Enterobacter (MBC), E. coli (MBC and MIC) and S. aureus (MBC and MIC). There is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. Our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of rifaximin against isolates from patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - Rifaximin, a non-absorbable rifamycin derivative, has published clinical efficacy in the alleviation of symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is associated with the pathogenesis of IBS. This study describes for the first time the antimicrobial effect of rifaximin against SIBO micro-organisms from humans. Fluid was aspirated from the third part of the duodenum from 567 consecutive patients; quantitative cultures diagnosed SIBO in 117 patients (20.6%). A total of 170 aerobic micro-organisms were isolated and the in vitro efficacy of rifaximin was studied by (i) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing by a microdilution technique and (ii) time-kill assays using bile to simulate the small intestinal environment. At a breakpoint of 32 mug/mL, rifaximin inhibited in vitro 85.4% of Escherichia coli, 43.6% of Klebsiella spp., 34.8% of Enterobacter spp., 54.5% of other Enterobacteriaceae spp., 82.6% of non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negative spp., 100% of Enterococcus faecalis, 100% of Enterococcus faecium and 100% of Staphylococcus aureus. For the time-kill assays, 11 E. coli, 15 non-E. coli Gram-negative enterobacteria and three E. faecalis isolates were studied. Rifaximin produced a >3 log10 decrease in the starting inoculum against most of the tested isolates at 500 mug/mL after 24h of growth. The results indicate that rifaximin has a potent effect on specific small bowel flora associated with SIBO. This conclusion should be regarded in light of the considerable time-kill effect at concentrations lower than those achieved in the bowel lumen after administration of conventional doses in humans.
TI  - Functional motions modulating VanA ligand binding unraveled by self-organizing maps.
AB  - The VanA D-Ala:D-Lac ligase is a key enzyme in the emergence of high level resistance to vancomycin in Enterococcus species and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It catalyzes the formation of D-Ala-D-Lac instead of the vancomycin target, D-Ala-D-Ala, leading to the production of modified, low vancomycin binding affinity peptidoglycan precursors. Therefore, VanA appears as an attractive target for the design of new antibacterials to overcome resistance. The catalytic site of VanA is delimited by three domains and closed by an omega-loop upon enzymatic reaction. The aim of the present work was (i) to investigate the conformational transition of VanA associated with the opening of its omega-loop and of a part of its central domain and (ii) to relate this transition with the substrate or product binding propensities. Molecular dynamics trajectories of the VanA ligase of Enterococcus faecium with or without a disulfide bridge distant from the catalytic site revealed differences in the catalytic site conformations with a slight opening. Conformations were clustered with an original machine learning method, based on self-organizing maps (SOM), which revealed four distinct conformational basins. Several ligands related to substrates, intermediates, or products were docked to SOM representative conformations with the DOCK 6.5 program. Classification of ligand docking poses, also performed with SOM, clearly distinguished ligand functional classes: substrates, reaction intermediates, and product. This result illustrates the acuity of the SOM classification and supports the quality of the DOCK program poses. The protein-ligand interaction features for the different classes of poses will guide the search and design of novel inhibitors.
TI  - Could chloramphenicol be used against ESKAPE pathogens? A review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
AB  - The widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'ESKAPE' (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acintobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens. Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.
TI  - Prevalence of antibiotic resistance in US hospitals.
AB  - The percentage of isolates resistant to essential antibiotics among clinically significant bacterial pathogens was evaluated using data from 80089 qualifying admissions in 19 US hospitals (2007-2010). Percentage resistant was highest for the following pathogen/antibiotic pairs: Enterococcus faecium/vancomycin (87.1% [95% CI 86.0-88.1] of 4024 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus/oxacillin-methicillin (56.8% [56.1-57.4] of 23477 isolates), S. aureus/clindamycin (39.7% [39.1-40.4] of 21133 isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa/fluoroquinolones (32.6% [31.8-33.5] of 10982 isolates), and Escherichia coli/fluoroquinolones (31.3% [30.8-31.8] of 30715 isolates). The percentage resistant was 3.9% (3.2-4.9) for E. faecium/daptomycin (n = 2029 isolates). While these results are consistent with those from earlier studies in many respects, the percentage of E. faecium isolates resistant to daptomycin, while still small, is higher than has been reported to date.
TI  - Validation of a novel murine wound model of Acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  - Patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by ESKAPE pathogens, which include A. baumannii (the ESKAPE pathogens are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). As new therapies are being developed to counter A. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. Here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. The model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. A 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. Uninoculated control wounds healed within 13 days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days. Treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16S rRNA community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. The range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. The model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. Ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates collected from the Middle East and Africa between 2004 and 2011.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. In this study, susceptibility among Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the Middle East and Africa was examined. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. In total, 2967 Gram-positive and 6322 Gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. All Enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of Escherichia coli and 32.9% of Klebsiella pneumoniae. More than 95% of E. coli and Enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the MIC90 (MIC required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against A. baumannii was low at 2mg/L. Tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most Gram-negative pathogens. Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most Gram-positive pathogens from the Middle East and Africa.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Novel method to identify the optimal antimicrobial peptide in a combination matrix, using anoplin as an example.
AB  - Microbial resistance is an increasing health concern and a true danger to human well-being. A worldwide search for new compounds is ongoing, and antimicrobial peptides are promising lead candidates for tomorrow's antibiotics. The decapeptide anoplin (GLLKRIKTLL-NH2) is an especially interesting candidate because of its small size as well as its antimicrobial and nonhemolytic properties. Optimization of the properties of an antimicrobial peptide such as anoplin requires multidimensional searching in a complex chemical space. Typically, such optimization is performed by labor-intensive and costly trial-and-error methods. In this study, we show the benefit of fractional factorial design for identification of the optimal antimicrobial peptide in a combination matrix. We synthesized and analyzed a training set of 12 anoplin analogs, representative of 64 analogs in total. Using MIC, hemolysis, and high-performance liquid chromatography retention time data, we constructed analysis-of-variance models that describe the relationship between these properties and the structural characteristics of the analogs. We show that the mathematical models derived from the training set data can be used to predict the properties of other analogs in the chemical space. Hence, this method provides an efficient means of identification of the optimal peptide in the searched chemical space.
TI  - [Surveillance of bacterial distribution and drug resistance in inpatients with surgical infections: a single center study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial distribution and drug resistance in patients with surgical infections, and provide the basis for the standardization treatment of the surgical infection. METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed from January 2008 to December 2011 surgical infection in our samples bacteria identification and drug sensitivity test results. RESULTS: A total of 3829 nonduplicate isolates from 3257 samples, Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 62.4% (the main microbes were P.aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E.coli etc) and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 37.6% (the main microbes were Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus). Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were on an obvious increase. For the performance of the high level of sensitive to Imipenem, Amikacin, Piperacillin and Tazobactam by E. coli and K. pneumonia. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii to cephalosporins, Carbapenems and Fluoroqinolones were higher resistant with Multidrug resistance. No vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant Enterococcus faecium were found. The prevalence of ESBL E.coli was 45.6%-61.5% and ESBL K.pneumoniae isolates were fluctuated. The methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) isolates were relatively high (21.1%-55.8%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than the other Gram-positive cocci. Vancomycin for Staphylococcus performance was highly sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The main composition of surgical clinical infection pathogens are Gram-negative bacillus, and the emergency of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. The resistant rate shows ascendant trend; Drug resistance is significantly higher in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and challenging issue.
TI  - Pediatric antimicrobial susceptibility trends across the United States.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns across US pediatric healthcare institutions are unknown. A national pooled pediatric antibiogram (1) identifies nationwide trends in antimicrobial resistance, (2) allows across-hospital benchmarking, and (3) provides guidance for empirical antimicrobial regimens for institutions unable to generate pediatric antibiograms. METHODS: In January 2012, a request for submission of pediatric antibiograms between 2005 and 2011 was sent to 233 US hospitals. A summary antibiogram was compiled from participating institutions to generate proportions of antimicrobial susceptibility. Temporal and regional comparisons were evaluated using chi(2) tests and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: Of 200 institutions (85%) responding to our survey, 78 (39%) reported generating pediatric antibiograms, and 55 (71%) submitted antibiograms. Carbapenems had the highest activity against the majority of gram-negative organisms tested, but no antibiotic had more than 90% activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Approximately 50% of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. Western hospitals had significantly lower proportions of S. aureus that were methicillin resistant compared with all other regions tested. Overall, 21% of S. aureus isolates had resistance to clindamycin. Among Enterococcus faecium isolates, the prevalence of susceptibility to ampicillin (25%) and vancomycin (45%) was low but improved over time (P< .01), and 8% of E. faecium isolates were resistant to linezolid. Southern hospitals reported significantly higher prevalence of E. faecium with susceptibilities to ampicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid compared with the other 3 regions (P< .01). CONCLUSIONS: A pooled, pediatric antibiogram can identify nationwide antimicrobial resistance patterns for common pathogens and might serve as a useful tool for benchmarking resistance and informing national prescribing guidelines for children.
TI  - Prevalence of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes aph(3')-IIIa and aph(3')-IIa in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Austria.
AB  - The aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-IIa primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-IIIa also inactivates amikacin. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in Austria. In total, 10 541 Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. Isolates were analysed by aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII- and aph(3')-IIa/nptII-specific TaqMan real-time PCR. For positive strains, MICs using Etests were performed and resistance gene sequences were determined. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). In Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa and Salmonella spp., the aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %), 0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. Eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. The overall prevalence of aph(3')-IIa/nptII was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). Escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), Staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and P. aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-IIa. A single Salmonella isolate was positive, resulting in an aph(3')-IIa prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-IIIa/nptIII carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-IIIa. aph(3')-IIa/nptII genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene pool during the observation period.
TI  - Epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens in cancer patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: Infection due to the six ESKAPE pathogens has recently been identified as a serious emerging problem. However, there is still a lack of information on bacteremia caused by these organisms in cancer patients. We aimed to assess the epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (rESKAPE) in patients with cancer. METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized adults with cancer from 2006 to 2011 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1,148 episodes of bacteremia, 392 (34 %) were caused by ESKAPE pathogens. Fifty-four episodes (4.7 %) were due to rESKAPE strains (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium 0, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 13, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESLB)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae 7, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 4, carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and derepression chromosomic ss-lactam and ESBL-producing Enterobacter species 12. Risk factors independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, urinary catheter and urinary tract source. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was more frequent in patients with rESKAPE bacteremia than in the other cases (55.6 % vs. 21.5 %, p < 0.001). Persistence of bacteremia (25 % vs. 9.7 %), septic metastasis (8 % vs. 4 %) and early case-fatality rate (23 % vs. 11 %) were more frequent in patients with rESKAPE bacteremia than in patients with other etiologies (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia due to rESKAPE pathogens in cancer patients occurs mainly among those with comorbidities who have received prior antibiotic therapy and have a urinary tract source. These patients often receive inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and have a poor outcome.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - In-vitro experimental evaluation of skin-to-surface recovery of four bacterial species by antibacterial and non-antibacterial medical examination gloves.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of bacteria recovered from a stainless steel coupon after  touching a pigskin substrate with an examination glove coated on its outside with polyhexanide (PHMB), as compared to the number of bacteria recovered in the same manner with non-coated control gloves was evaluated. METHODS: Suspensions containing 1 x 109 colony-forming units of 4 clinically relevant bacterial species (Enterococcus faecium ATCC #51559; Escherichia coli ATCC #25922; Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC #4352; and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC #33591) were used to contaminate Gamma-irradiated pigskin substrates. Bacterial recoveries from the pigskin substrate, stainless steel coupons, and each glove swatch were performed. A difference in the bacterial recovery from the stainless steel coupons after touching with coated and uncoated control gloves was measured. RESULTS: For E. faecium, the coated glove showed a reduction of 4.63 log10 cfu recovery, when compared to control gloves. For E. coli, the coated glove showed 5.48 log10 cfu, for K. pneumoniae 5.03 log10 cfu, and for S. aureus 5.72 log10 cfu recovery, when compared to the non-coated control glove. CONCLUSION: An in-vitro experiment designed to mimic cross-contamination of clinically relevant bacteria in a simulated healthcare setting following glove contact with a contaminated biological surface and cross-transfer to a stainless steel surface has demonstrated that an examination glove coated on its outside surface with PHMB was able to reduce bacterial recovery from a contaminated surface by > 4 log10 cfu, compared to a control non-coated examination glove. These elaborated results may encourage further clinical investigation on the clinical impact of an antibacterial examination glove.
TI  - [Analysis of resistance tendency of bloodstream-infecting pathogens in China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the resistance profiles and the trend of bloodstream-infecting pathogens isolated from hospitalized patients during 2004-2010. METHODS: The bloodstream isolates were collected from 18 hospitals in 17 cities. Minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) were determined using the agar dilution method recommended by CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute), and susceptibility results were analyzed according to the 2011 CLSI guideline. RESULTS: Among the 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 periods, the proportions of clinical isolates were similar; 43.1% (149 isolates), 34.0% (151 isolates) and 47.5% (776 isolates) for Gram positive strains, 56.9% (197 isolates), 66.0% (293 isolates) and 52.5% (858 isolates) for Gram negative strains, respectively. The isolating rate of MRSA was 54.1% (20/37) in 2007-2008, which was the highest among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010, while it decreased in 2009-2010 (36.5%, 62/170). The MRCNS proportions were similar across the 3 periods. One (1.8%) vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and 1 linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis were found. Although the isolating rates of penicillin non-sensitive strains (oral) were similar between 2009-2010 and 2007-2008 [54.5% (6/11) and 53.9% (7/13), respectively], the resistant rates increased from 0% in 2007-2008 to 30.8% (4/13) in 2009-2010. The results were similar according to the non-meningitis criterion (IV), and the susceptibility rates decreased from 100.0% (11 isolates) in 2007-2008 to 84.6% (11/13) in 2009-2010. ESBL-harboring strains in E. coli were similar among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010 [66.7% (30/45), 73.2% (71/97) and 67.9% (233/343), respectively]. ESBL-producing strains in Klebsilla pnuemoniae decreased year after year, 72.4% (21/29), 50.0% (18/36) and 41.1% (65/158) in 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively. Except that the sensitive rate of Enterobacter cloacae to ertapenem was 80% (32/40), the sensitive rates of other strains to carbapenems were still above 90% and the resistance rates were less than 5%. Acinetobacter baumannii had the highest multi-drug resistance rate (81.8%, 81/99). One strain (1.0%, 1/99) of Acinetobacter baumannii isolated in 2009-2010 was reported to be pan-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: We are facing a more serious situation of bacterial resistance. Acinetobacter baumannii resistance was most serious, usually with the characteristics of multiple drug resistance, and even pan-resistance. Carbapenems remain to be the most effective against enterobacteriaceae. Strains resistant to novel antibiotics (linezolid and tigecycline) have emerged.
TI  - Evidence for phenylalanine zipper-mediated dimerization in the X-ray crystal structure of a magainin 2 analogue.
AB  - High-resolution structure elucidation has been challenging for the large group of host-defense peptides that form helices on or within membranes but do not manifest a strong folding propensity in aqueous solution. Here we report the crystal structure of an analogue of the widely studied host-defense peptide magainin 2. Magainin 2 (S8A, G13A, G18A) is a designed variant that displays enhanced antibacterial activity relative to the natural peptide. The crystal structure of magainin 2 (S8A, G13A, G18A), obtained for the racemic form, features a dimerization mode that has previously been proposed to play a role in the antibacterial activity of magainin 2 and related peptides.
TI  - A current perspective on daptomycin for the clinical microbiologist.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antimicrobial with in vitro bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria that was first approved for clinical use in 2004 in the United States. Since this time, significant data have emerged regarding the use of daptomycin for the treatment of serious infections, such as bacteremia and endocarditis, caused by Gram-positive pathogens. However, there are also increasing reports of daptomycin nonsusceptibility, in Staphylococcus aureus and, in particular, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. Such nonsusceptibility is largely in the context of prolonged treatment courses and infections with high bacterial burdens, but it may occur in the absence of prior daptomycin exposure. Nonsusceptibility in both S. aureus and Enterococcus is mediated by adaptations to cell wall homeostasis and membrane phospholipid metabolism. This review summarizes the data on daptomycin, including daptomycin's unique mode of action and spectrum of activity and mechanisms for nonsusceptibility in key pathogens, including S. aureus, E. faecium, and E. faecalis. The challenges faced by the clinical laboratory in obtaining accurate susceptibility results and reporting daptomycin MICs are also discussed.
TI  - Update of contemporary antimicrobial resistance rates across China: reference testing results for 12 medical centers (2011).
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (R) surveillance across Asia and especially in China has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. This 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in China (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). Samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (S) breakpoints. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% MRSA), Escherichia coli (EC; 288), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA; 221), Klebsiella spp. (KSP; 208), acinetobacters (ACB; 178), enterobacters (155), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 154, 46.8% penicillin-S), and enterococci (ENT; 137). Among 849 Gram-positive (GP) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (TIG), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% S). Resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% VISA, 15.4% teicoplanin non-S coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-R ENT (all Enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-R beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-S rates for SPN and viridans group streptococci, respectively. For Gram-negative bacilli, R among Enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in EC and KSP, respectively; carbapenem-R was only 2.1-4.3% with KPC and IMP type enzymes detected in KSP). The widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), TIG (98.6-100%), amikacin (AMK; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% S). PSA was most inhibited by AMK (90.5% S) and colistin (COL; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. Only COL (100% S) and TIG (MIC90, 2 mug/mL) showed significant potencies against ACB. In conclusion, R among pathogens from 12 Chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against GP pathogens, but more serious R problems were noted among Enterobacteriaceae, PSA, and ACB. Combination treatment for the latter multidrug-R strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national surveillance results applying reference methods.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - [Infections caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.)].
AB  - Methicillin -resistant Staphylocccus aureus (MRSA) and multirresistant entorococci are still problematic in nosocomial infections and new challenges have emerged for their containment. MRSA has increased the multiresistant profile; it has been described vancomycin and linezolid resistant isolates and isolates with decreased daptomycin susceptibility. Moreover, new clones (ST398) have emerged, initially associated with piggeries, and new mec variants (mecC) with livestock origin that escape to the detection with current molecular methods based on mecA gene have been detected. In enterococci, linzeolid resistant isolates and isolates with deceased susceptibility to daptomycin have been described. Moreover, ampicillin resistant Enterococcus faecium due to beta-lactamase production has been recently found in Europe. Control of MRSA isolates and multiresistant enteroccocci should combined antibiotic stewardship strategies and epidemiological measures, including detection of colonized patients in order to reduce colonization pressure and their transmission.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of propolis special extract GH 2002 against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - The need to discover and develop alternative therapies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is timely. The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial potential of propolis, as a purified and concentrated special extract GH 2002, against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistent Stapylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and Candida. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal microbicidial concentrations (MMCs) of propolis against microbial pathogens were evaluated using the broth microdilution method. Propolis extract GH 2002 revealed low MICs in the range of 0.03 to 2 mg/ml against S. pyogenes, S. aureus, E. faecium and Candida. A high bactericidal activity of propolis extract in the range of 0.06 to 1.0 mg/ml was determined for S. pyogenes and S. aureus, however propolis was not bactericidal against E. faecium. Propolis concentrations between 0.6 and 2.4 mg/ml displayed fungicidal activity against different Candida species. Whereas all tested MRSA strains were highly susceptible against propolis, only minor activity was found against VRE strains. Time-kill curves demonstrated a high antimicrobial activity at low MICs already after few hours of incubation against reference strains, clinical antibiotic-susceptible strains, clinical antifungal susceptible strains as well as all tested clinical MRSA strains, but not against VRE strains. In conclusion, clinical drug-sensitive as well as some clinical multidrug-resistant microbial isolates, i.e. MRSA, were susceptible to propolis with different degrees of susceptibility. These results suggest that the special propolis extract GH2002 might be used in the development of alternative products for therapy of microbial infections.
TI  - Synthetic analogs of anoplin show improved antimicrobial activities.
AB  - We present the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the decapeptide anoplin  and 19 analogs thereof tested against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 33591 (MRSA), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (ATCC 700221) (VRE), and Candida albicans (ATCC 200955). The anoplin analogs contain substitutions in amino acid positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. We use these peptides to study the effect of altering the charge and hydrophobicity of anoplin on activity against red blood cells and microorganisms. We find that increasing the charge and/or hydrophobicity improves antimicrobial activity and increases hemolytic activity. For each strain tested, we identify at least six anoplin analogs with an improved therapeutic index compared with anoplin, the only exception being Enterococcus faecium, against which only few compounds are more specific than anoplin. Both 2Nal(6) and Cha(6) show improved therapeutic index against all strains tested.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured Cu-SiO2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  - There is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (HCAI). One method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. The antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in HCAI. The structure of the coatings was determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. Antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on BS ISO 22196:2007. The coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. SEM showed nano-structured aggregates of Cu within a silica matrix. A log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. The results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. The coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
TI  - New antibiotics for bad bugs: where are we?
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is growing up day by day in both community and hospital setting, with a significant impact on the mortality and morbidity rates and the financial burden that is associated. In the last two decades multi drug resistant microorganisms (both hospital- and community-acquired) challenged the scientific groups into developing new antimicrobial compounds that can provide safety in use according to the new regulation, good efficacy patterns, and low resistance profile. In this review we made an evaluation of present data regarding the new classes and the new molecules from already existing classes of antibiotics and the ongoing trends in antimicrobial development. Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) supported a proGram, called "the '10 x 20' initiative", to develop ten new systemic antibacterial drugs within 2020. The microorganisms mainly involved in the resistance process, so called the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae) were the main targets. In the era of antimicrobial resistance the new antimicrobial agents like fifth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, beta-lactamases inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, oxazolidones, glycopeptides, and tetracyclines active against Gram-positive pathogens, like vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) and MRSA, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) but also against highly resistant Gram-negative organisms are more than welcome. Of these compounds some are already approved by official agencies, some are still in study, but the need of new antibiotics still does not cover the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Therefore the management of antimicrobial resistance should also include fostering coordinated actions by all stakeholders, creating policy guidance, support for surveillance and technical assistance.
TI  - Daptomycin use in neutropenic patients with documented gram-positive infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to describe the outcomes associated with daptomycin treatment of documented gram-positive infections in patients with neutropenia. METHODS: All patients with neutropenia (</=500 cells/m(3)) and at least one documented gram-positive culture from 2006-2009 were identified from a retrospective, multicenter, and observational registry (Cubicin((R)) Outcome Registry and Experience (CORE((R)))). Investigators assessed patient outcome (cured, improved, failed, nonevaluable) at the end of daptomycin therapy. All patients were included in the safety analysis. RESULTS: The efficacy population had 186 patients; 159 (85 %) patients had either cure (n = 108, 58 %) or improved (n = 51, 27 %) as an outcome. Success rates (cure plus improved) by the lowest WBC during daptomycin were 98/116 (84 %) for </=100 cells/m(3) and 61/70 (87 %) for 101-499 cells/m(3), P = 0.6. Most patients had cancer; 135/186 (73 %) had hematological malignancy; 26/186 (14 %) had solid tumors, and 9 (5 %) had both. One hundred fifty-six (84 %) patients received other antibiotics before daptomycin treatment; 82 % vancomycin, of which 31 % failed vancomycin. The most common infections were bacteremia (78 %), skin and skin structure infections (8 %), and urinary tract infections/pyelonephritis (6 %). The most common pathogens were vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (47 %), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20 %), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (19 %). The median (min, max) initial daptomycin dose was 6 mg/kg (3.6, 8.3). The median (min, max) daptomycin duration of therapy was 14 days (1, 86). Possibly related adverse events occurred in 12/209 patients (6 %), and 13 patients (6 %) discontinued daptomycin due to adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that daptomycin appeared useful and well tolerated in neutropenic patients, and the degree of neutropenia did not affect daptomycin success rates. Comparative clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.
TI  - One-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 German hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. To combat multidrug resistant organisms (MRDOs) networks of care providers have been established in all states in Germany. The HICARE-network, a project to combat MRDOs, founded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, German-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the German Society of Hospital Hygiene. The aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation of the situation in 2012. METHOD: The survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in May 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. As in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. Based on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (HA), community-acquired (CA) and lifestock-associated (LA) MRSA), vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA/GRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis resp. Enterococcus faecium (VR-E. faecalis resp. VR-E. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (ESBL) E. coli (ESBL-EC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP), multiresistant Acinetobacter spp. (MAB), multiresistant Pseudomonas spp. (MRP), carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as well as Clostridium difficile (CD) infections and severe infections requiring ICU-treatment were included in the survey along with additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. RESULTS: Out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). Data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). The most frequently reported organisms were MRSA 1.53% [CI95: 1.32-1.75], followed by CDAD 1.30% [CI95: 1.11-1.50], ESBL-EC 0.97% [CI95: 0.80-1.14], and ESBL-KP 0.27% [CI95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. Prevalence of MRDOs depended on the level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. Overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical wards compared to surgical wards. All tertiary care providers employed their own infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. Surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. DISCUSSION: With more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over Germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness of the problem of antibacterial resistance in Germany. The prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. Some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. This statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - A multicentre evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of high-dose daptomycin  for the treatment of infective endocarditis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite significant medical advances, infective endocarditis (IE) remains an infection associated with high morbidity and mortality. The objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of high-dose daptomycin, defined as >/= 8 mg/kg/day, in patients with confirmed or suspected staphylococcal and/or enterococcal IE. METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective observational study (2005-11). Adult patients, not undergoing haemodialysis, with blood cultures positive for staphylococci or enterococci and a definitive or possible diagnosis of IE, who received daptomycin >/= 8 mg/kg/day (based on total body weight) for >/= 72 h were included. RESULTS: Seventy patients met the inclusion criteria and comprised 33 (47.1%) with right-sided IE (RIE), 35 (50%) with left-sided IE (LIE) and 2 with both RIE and LIE. Several patients had concomitant sites of infection, with bone/joint infection being most prevalent (12.9%). Sixty-five patients received daptomycin as salvage therapy. Pathogens were isolated from 64 patients, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common organism (84.4%), followed by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (7.8%). The median (IQR) daptomycin dose was 9.8 mg/kg/day (8.2-10.0 mg/kg/day), and was similar in RIE and LIE patients (9.8 and 9.3 mg/kg/day, respectively). A total of 24 (34.3%) received combination therapy. For those patients with pathogens isolated (n = 64), the organism was eradicated in 57 (89.1%) patients. Among 64 clinically evaluable patients, 55 (85.9%) achieved clinical success. No patients required discontinuation of high-dose daptomycin due to creatine phosphokinase elevations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with both RIE and LIE had successful outcomes with high-dose daptomycin therapy. Additional clinical trials evaluating high daptomycin dosages in patients with IE are warranted.
TI  - Specificity of the neutralizers as the cause of errors in evaluating disinfectant efficacy: an assessment of triclosan.
AB  - One of the most commonly used methods for assessing disinfectants in vitro is the dilution-neutralization test. Although it is known that using an effective neutralizer is essential for obtaining reliable results, in the case of disinfectants like triclosan, whose neutralization is more complicated, an adequate neutralizer is not always used. Here, we compare the efficacy of different neutralizers described previously, and others that have been modified, against several antiseptic formulations of triclosan. The strains of reference used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The solutions of antiseptic were triclosan 2% aqueous solution, and three alcoholic solutions containing 2, 0.068 and 0.5% triclosan, respectively. In the dilution-neutralization test, six neutralizers with different degrees of complexity were assayed. Our results show that the antiseptic solutions studied are effective against the strains of reference, with the exception of triclosan 2% aqueous solution against Ps. aeruginosa. Most neutralizers proved ineffective, depending on the antiseptic solution and the bacterial species, particularly in the case of Staph. aureus. These findings confirm a need to test every neutralizer specifically for each disinfectant, at the maximum concentration used, and for every specific bacterial strain. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The choice of an adequate neutralizing agent is essential for obtaining precise results in the evaluation of disinfectants using the dilution-neutralization method. In this study, we show that the neutralization of triclosan and some of its commercial solutions is not a simple task, requiring complex neutralizers. Moreover, the action of the neutralizer is shown to depend on the micro-organism tested. Specificity in view of the disinfectant and the micro-organism calls for performing the neutralizing assay in each particular case of application of the dilution-neutralization method. We also demonstrate that some of the neutralizers described for triclosan in previous studies are not sufficiently effective.
TI  - Risk factors and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens in solid-organ transplant recipients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infections due to the six ESKAPE pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problem, information regarding bacteremia caused by these organisms in solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients is lacking. We sought to determine the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant ESKAPE (rESKAPE) organisms in liver, kidney, and heart adult transplant recipients. METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized SOT recipients from 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 276 episodes of bacteremia, 54 (19.6%) were due to rESKAPE strains (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium [0], methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [5], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [10], carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii [8], carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [26], and derepressed chromosomal beta-lactam and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter species [5]). Factors independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were prior transplantation, septic shock, and prior antibiotic therapy. Patients with rESKAPE bacteremia more often received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy than the others (41% vs. 21.6%; P=0.01). Overall case-fatality rate (30 days) was higher in patients with rESKAPE bacteremia (35.2% vs. 14.4%; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia due to rESKAPE pathogens is frequent in SOT recipients and causes significant morbidity and mortality. rESKAPE organisms should be considered when selecting empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized SOT recipients presenting with septic shock, particularly those with prior transplantation and antibiotic use.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - [An analysis of resistance of nosocomial infection pathogens isolated from 13 teaching hospitals in 2011].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogen profile of nosocomial infection in China,  and to survey the susceptibility rates of these pathogens to the clinical common antibiotics. METHODS: The non-repetitive nosocomial pathogens isolated from bloodstream infection (BSI), hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) and intra-abdominal infection (IAI) and the case data were collected from 13 teaching hospitals in different areas of China and sent to a central laboratory for re-identification and susceptibility testing. The levels of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the common antibiotics were determined by agar dilution method. The data were analyzed by WHONET 5.6 software. RESULTS: A total of 2103 clinical isolates were collected from January to December 2011, of which gram positive cocci and gram negative organisms accounted for 23.2% and 76.8% respectively. The top three pathogens of BSI were E. coli (31.0%, 243/784), K. pneumoniae (14.8%, 116/784) and S. aureus (10.6%, 83/784). The top three pathogens of HAP were A. baumannii (24.2%, 158/652), P. aeruginosa (23.0%, 150/652) and K. pneumoniae (16.4%, 107/652). The top three pathogens of IAI were E. coli (34.3%, 229/667), E. faecium (13.3%, 89/667) and K. pneumoniae (9.6%, 64/667). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) accounted for 64.4% and 78.1% respectively. The susceptibility rates of Staphylococcus species to tigecycline, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid were all 100%. The prevalence of MRSA in HAP was significantly higher than that in BSI or IAI. The susceptibility rates of Enterococcus species to tigecycline, teicoplanin and linezolid were all 100%. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was 64.3% in E. coli and 38.3% in K. pneumonia. Against Enterobacteriaceae, the most active agents were as following in order: tigecycline (92.3% - 100%) [except P.mirabilis], meropenem (87.5% - 100%), imipenem (87.5% - 100%) [except M. morganii], amikacin (87.5% - 100%), polymyxin B (75% - 100%) [except S. marcescens, P. mirabilis and M morganii], cefepime (67.8% - 100%), cefoperazone-sulbactam (66.6% - 100%), piperacillin-tazobactam (61.5% - 100%). Carbapenem-resistance Enterobacteriaceae strains emerged. The susceptibility rates of P. aeruginosa to imipenem and meropenem were 66.2% and 72.2%, respectively. The susceptibility rates of A. baumannii to imipenem and meropenem were 27.7% and 25.9%, respectively. The most active agents against A. baumannii were polymyxin B (100%), followed by tigecycline (79.8%) and minocycline (50.4%). The susceptibility rates of P.aeruginosa to antibiotics in BSI were higher than those in HAP and IAI. Susceptibility rates of S. maltophilia to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline and levofloxacin were about 90% or above. Susceptibility rates of B. cepacia to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftazidime and meropenem were all 100%. Several P.aeruginosa and A. baumannii strains were resistant to all tested antibiotics except polymyxin B. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogen profile is different in different types of infection. The prevalence of multi-drug resistant A. baumannii is high, which is still a key problem of nosocomial infection. Tigecycline remains relatively high activity against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacteria (except P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis) in vitro.
TI  - Multiplex identification of gram-positive bacteria and resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths: evaluation of an automated microarray-based nucleic acid test.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the Verigene Gram-Positive Blood Culture Test (BC-GP) test to identify 12 Gram-positive bacterial gene targets and three genetic resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths containing Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 1,252 blood cultures containing Gram-positive bacteria were prospectively collected and tested at five clinical centers between April, 2011 and January, 2012. An additional 387 contrived blood cultures containing uncommon targets (e.g., Listeria spp., S. lugdunensis, vanB-positive Enterococci) were included to fully evaluate the performance of the BC-GP test. Sensitivity and specificity for the 12 specific genus or species targets identified by the BC-GP test ranged from 92.6%-100% and 95.4%-100%, respectively. Identification of the mecA gene in 599 cultures containing S. aureus or S. epidermidis was 98.6% sensitive and 94.3% specific compared to cefoxitin disk method. Identification of the vanA gene in 81 cultures containing Enterococcus faecium or E. faecalis was 100% sensitive and specific. Approximately 7.5% (87/1,157) of single-organism cultures contained Gram-positive bacteria not present on the BC-GP test panel. In 95 cultures containing multiple organisms the BC-GP test was in 71.6% (68/95) agreement with culture results. Retrospective analysis of 107 separate blood cultures demonstrated that identification of methicillin resistant S. aureus and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. was completed an average of 41.8 to 42.4 h earlier using the BC-GP test compared to routine culture methods. The BC-GP test was unable to assign mecA to a specific organism in cultures containing more than one Staphylococcus isolate and does not identify common blood culture contaminants such as Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, and Bacillus. CONCLUSIONS: The BC-GP test is a multiplex test capable of detecting most leading causes of Gram-positive bacterial blood stream infections as well as genetic markers of methicillin and vancomycin resistance directly from positive blood cultures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a UV-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) produced by Enterococcus faecium strain DSH20 against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. The current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains. METHODS: Acquired resistance profiles of Enterococcus isolates determined based on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition as multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pandrug resistant (PDR). BLIS activity of Enterococcus isolates was investigated against Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) ATCC 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including VRE, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative bacteria containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and Escherichia coli (E. coli). RESULTS: Among 273 Enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 VRE isolates, respectively, were XDR and PDR and eight isolates had BLIS activity against the indicator strain. One of these isolates, identified as E. faecium strain DSH20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence, had potent BLIS production against all 29 VRE strains, but had no activity against MRSA, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and E. coli strains. It was heat stable up to 121 degrees C for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the pH range of 3-9 and had UV stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase K, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. It was designated as an approximately 35kDa peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method. CONCLUSION: This peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of VRE infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the pleuromutilin antibiotic BC-3781 against bacterial  pathogens isolated in the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program in 2010.
AB  - BC-3781 is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. BC-3781 has completed a phase 2 clinical trial in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Its antibacterial spectrum additionally covers the predominant pathogens causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). In this study, the antibacterial activity of BC-3781 was evaluated against a contemporary collection of 10,035 bacterial isolates predominately causing ABSSSI and CABP, among other infections, collected within the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program worldwide in 2010. BC-3781 exhibited potent activity against organisms commonly isolated from ABSSSI such as Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 99.8% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.03 mug/ml; 99.3% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml; 97.8% inhibited at </=1 mug/ml). BC-3781 displayed similar MIC distributions among methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus strains. BC-3781 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, with 76.3% of vancomycin-susceptible and 97.0% of vancomycin-resistant isolates being inhibited at BC-3781 concentrations of </=1 mug/ml. Beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible to BC-3781, with 99.3% and 96.7% of isolates inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Further, activity of BC-3781 against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) was not negatively influenced by beta-lactamase production or resistance to other antimicrobial classes tested. In all, BC-3781 displayed a very potent antibacterial profile including the most prevalent bacterial pathogens causing ABSSSI and CABP, thus warranting further clinical development of this antibiotic in these and possibly other indications.
TI  - Lysins: the arrival of pathogen-directed anti-infectives.
AB  - Lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. Lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific Gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. The potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. Through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. Furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. Clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of lysins in humans.
TI  - Resistance mechanisms and epidemiology of multiresistant pathogens in Europe and  efficacy of tigecycline in observational studies.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial drug resistance is a growing problem in Europe and, even with differences in epidemiology, it is of great concern. The treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) is hindered further by pathogens that are resistant to methicillin, carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins and glycopeptides. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An analysis of the microbiological results from five European observational studies (July 2006 to October 2011) evaluating the efficacy of tigecycline (prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials) for the treatment of cSSTI and cIAI is presented. RESULTS: In total, 213 cSSTI and 623 cIAI patients were included; 34.4% and 56.6%, respectively, were critically ill in intensive care units. At baseline, at least one pathogen was isolated in 167 (78.4%) cSSTI and 464 (74.5%) cIAI patients, and 32.9% and 49.1% of infections were polymicrobial. In cSSTI, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (52.7% and 18.0%, respectively) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, whereas in cIAI most infections were due to E. coli (41.8%), Enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis (21.1%). Clinical response was observed in >80% of patients with E. coli in both cIAI and cSSTI. In cSSTI patients, the clinical response rate to S. aureus was 80.8%. For cIAI, 77.4% of E. faecium and 79.5% of E. faecalis patients responded to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline when given alone or in combination with other antibacterials appeared to be efficacious against multiple pathogens, affirming its role in real-life clinical practice as a broad-spectrum antibacterial for the treatment of patients with cSSTI and cIAI, including the critically ill, across Europe.
TI  - Efficacy of tigecycline for the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections in real-life clinical practice from five European observational studies.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tigecycline is an approved treatment for complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs). The efficacy of tigecycline as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials in the treatment of cSSTI in routine practice is described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individual patient-level data were pooled from five European observational studies (July 2006 to October 2011). RESULTS: A total of 254 cSSTI patients who received tigecycline were included (mean age 63.2 +/- 14.9 years). Of these, 34.4% were in intensive care units, 54.5% acquired their infection in hospital and 90.9% had at least one comorbidity. Infection most commonly affected the limbs (62.4%) and 43.8% of infections were classified as necrotizing. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores at the beginning of treatment were 15.0 +/- 7.9 (n = 205) and 5.8 +/- 3.9 (n = 32), respectively, indicating high disease severity. Staphylococcus aureus (52.7%), Escherichia coli (18.0%) and Enterococcus faecium (12.0%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens; 32.9% of infections were polymicrobial and 30.5% were due to resistant pathogens. Overall, 71.8% received tigecycline as monotherapy and 28.2% as combination therapy for a mean duration of 12 days. Clinical response rates at the end of treatment were 79.6% for all patients who received the standard dosage (183/230), 86.7% for patients who received tigecycline as monotherapy (143/165), 75.0% for patients with a nosocomial infection (96/128), 75.3% for patients with an APACHE II score >15 (61/81) and 58.3% for patients with a SOFA score >/= 7 (7/12). CONCLUSIONS: In these real-life studies, tigecycline, alone and in combination, achieved favourable clinical response rates in patients with cSSTI with a high severity of illness.
TI  - Effect of in-feed paromomycin supplementation on antimicrobial resistance of enteric bacteria in turkeys.
AB  - Histomoniasis in turkeys can be prevented by administering paromomycin sulfate, an aminoglycoside antimicrobial agent, in feed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of in-feed paromomycin sulfate supplementation on the antimicrobial resistance of intestinal bacteria in turkeys. Twelve flocks of breeder turkeys were administered 100 ppm paromomycin sulfate from hatching to day 120; 12 flocks not supplemented with paromomycin were used as controls. Faecal samples were collected monthly from days 0 to 180. The resistance of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus to paramomycin and other antimicrobial agents was compared in paromomycin supplemented (PS) and unsupplemented (PNS) flocks. E. coli from PS birds had a significantly higher frequency of resistance to paromomycin, neomycin and kanamycin until 1 month after the end of supplementation compared to PNS birds. Resistance to amoxicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also more frequent in PS turkeys. Resistance was mainly due to the presence of aph genes, which could be transmitted by conjugation, sometimes with streptomycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, trimethoprim or sulfonamide resistance genes. Resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin in E. faecium was significantly different in PS and PNS breeders on days 60 and 90. Significantly higher frequencies of resistance to paromomycin, kanamycin, neomycin and tobramycin were observed in S. aureus isolates from PS birds. Paromomycin supplementation resulted in resistance to aminoglycosides in bacteria of PS turkeys. Co-selection for resistance to other antimicrobial agents was observed in E. coli isolates.
TI  - Combinatorial biosynthesis and antibacterial evaluation of glycosylated derivatives of 12-membered macrolide antibiotic YC-17.
AB  - Expression plasmids carrying different deoxysugar biosynthetic gene cassettes and the gene encoding a substrate-flexible glycosyltransferase DesVII were constructed and introduced into Streptomyces venezuelae YJ003 mutant strain bearing a deletion of a desosamine biosynthetic (des) gene cluster. The resulting recombinants produced macrolide antibiotic YC-17 analogs possessing unnatural sugars replacing native D-desosamine. These metabolites were isolated and further purified using chromatographic techniques and their structures were determined as D-quinovosyl-10-deoxymethynolide, L-rhamnosyl-10-deoxymethynolide, L-olivosyl-10-deoxymethynolide, and D-boivinosyl-10-deoxymethynolide on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and MS analyses and the stereochemistry of sugars was confirmed using coupling constant values and NOE correlations. Their antibacterial activities were evaluated in vitro against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Substitution with L-rhamnose displayed better antibacterial activity than parent compound YC-17 containing native sugar D-desosamine. The present study on relationships between chemical structures and antibacterial activities could be useful in generation of novel advanced antibiotics utilizing combinatorial biosynthesis approach.
TI  - Activity of four antimicrobial cocktails for tissue allograft decontamination against bacteria and Candida spp. of known susceptibility at different temperatures.
AB  - Several antimicrobial cocktail solutions of differing composition and concentrations are widely used to decontaminate viable banked tissue allografts at different temperatures and times of exposure. We compared the efficiency of four cocktails comprising nine antimicrobials to kill suspensions of a panel of 27 strains of 13 bacterial species, and 3 Candida spp. at 4, 22 and 37 degrees C for 24 h. All but one bacterial strains were susceptible to one or more of the agents tested individually at concentrations at least fourfold below the recommended susceptibility breakpoint minimum inhibitory concentrations for drug/species combinations. Candida lusitaniae was resistant to nystatin and amphotericin. The concentrations of several of the cocktail constituents were often greatly in excess (50-1,000-fold) of that required to inhibit the growth of susceptible strains. All cocktails were ineffective against a pan-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium and one of the four cocktails failed to kill two strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Each cocktail was most efficient at 37 degrees C, less so at 22 degrees C, and poorly active at 4 degrees C. We conclude that the practice of decontamination of tissues with antimicrobials at low temperatures is not supported by in vitro susceptibility tests.
TI  - Bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bloodstream infections in children with febrile neutropenia: experience of single center in southeast of Turkey.
AB  - Empirical antimicrobial therapy is usually started in febrile neutropenic patients without having culture results. The aim of this study was to help determine the policies of empirical antibiotic usage in febrile neutropenic children by detecting the antimicrobial susceptibility profile in this group of patients. In this study 811 blood cultures taken from neutropenic children hospitalized at the Department of Oncology of Gaziantep Children Hospital November 2007 and February 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Blood cultures were routinely collected in aerobic and anaerobic media and incubated using the BACTEC system. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates to antimicrobial agents was performed using the Vitek2((R)) system according to the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Of 811 isolates analyzed, 128 (56.4%) were gram positive cocci, 43 (18.9%) were gram negative bacilli and fungi accounted for 56 (24.7%). The main isolated Gram-positive bacteria from blood were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (56.7%), followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (14.1%). S. aureus and Streptococcus spp. were all susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. S aureus was still susceptible to few other antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline (82.4%), chloramphenicol (55.6%). Seven E. faecium, 7 E. fecalis and 1 E. hirae was isolated from blood cultures. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 6 out of 15 (40%) Enterococcus spp. isolates. Among gram-negative bacteria E. coli (30.2%) was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (20.9%) and Proteus spp. (18.6%). Imipenem (89.2%), meropenem (86.6%), chloramphenicol (88.9%), amicasin (82.4%) and fosfomycin (81.3%) showed highest susceptibility in vitro activity against all Gram-negative isolates. To know the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the pathogens frequently isolated from febrile neutropenic children and to consider this profile before starting an empirical antibiotic therapy would help the clinics which have any role in the treatment of these patients to determine the empirical antibiotic usage policies.
TI  - A new antimicrobial and anticancer peptide producing by the marine deep sediment  strain "Paenibacillus profundus" sp. nov. Sl 79.
AB  - A new linear glyceryl acid derived heptapeptide (1), together with known isocoumarin antibiotic, Y-05460M-A (2), were isolated from the culture of the deep sea sediment strain SI 79 classified as "Paenibacillus profundus" sp. nov. Their structures were determined by 1D- and 2D- NMR techniques and ESI-MS/MS experiments. HPLC analysis of the Marfey derivatives in comparison to their analogs of authentic amino acids revealed that all amino acids in peptide 1, with an exception of Val, have the D-configuration. The compound 1 showed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium as well as cytotoxic and moderate colony growth inhibitory activity against SK-MEL-28 cell line.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among Gram-positive organisms collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was designed to monitor  global longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. In this study, we examine susceptibility among Gram-positive isolates collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011. A total of 9,422 Gram-positive isolates were contributed by 1,255 centers, predominantly from Europe and North America. One-third of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, peaking in prevalence in 2007. All S. aureus isolates (n = 3,614) were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin; minocycline, imipenem, and meropenem were also highly active (>92% susceptibility). Ampicillin and penicillin susceptibility increased significantly during the study period (P < 0.0001 for both). Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 3,373) were highly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (>99%), and levofloxacin and tigecycline (both >96%); imipenem susceptibility was low (32%) in Africa while minocycline susceptibility was low in Asia-Pacific Rim (38%). Penicillin resistance occurred in one-fifth of all S. pneumoniae isolates, with penicillin susceptibility ranging from 14% in Africa to 65% in Europe. Streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 1,056) were highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although only 16% were susceptible to minocycline. Enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 1,112) were highly susceptible (>97%) to ampicillin, linezolid, penicillin, tigecycline, and vancomycin globally, but only 34% were minocycline susceptible; minocycline susceptibility decreased significantly from 2004 to 2011 (P < 0.001). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Enterococcus faecium (n = 267) globally (100% and 98% susceptible, respectively). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Gram-positive pathogens from pediatric patients in TEST 2004 to 2011, with vancomycin and the carbapenems performing well against most pathogens.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from milkmen and cows with clinical mastitis in and around Kampala, Uganda.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis is helpful in treatment and management decisions. However, such data from sub-Saharan Africa is scarce. Here we describe the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from cows with clinical mastitis in Kampala, Uganda. Due to high concern of zoonotic infections, isolates from milkmen are also described. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ninety seven milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 31 nasal swabs from milkmen were collected (one sample per cow/human). Fifty eight (60%) Gram-positive isolates namely Staphylococci (21), Enterococci (16), Streptococci (13), Lactococci (5), Micrococci (2) and Arcanobacteria (1) were detected in cows; only one grew Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, 24 (25%) coliforms namely Escherichia coli (12), Klebsiella oxytoca (5), Proteus vulgaris (2), Serratia (2), Citrobacter (1), Cedecea (1) and Leclercia (1) were identified. From humans, 24 Gram-positive bacteria grew, of which 11 were Staphylococci (35%) including four Staphylococcus aureus. Upon susceptibility testing, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were prevalent; 57%, 12/21 in cows and 64%, 7/11 in humans. However, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not detected. Furthermore, methicillin and vancomycin resistant CoNS were detected in cows (Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis) and humans (Staphylococcus scuiri). Also, vancomycin and daptomycin resistant Enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively) were detected in cows. Coliforms were less resistant with three pan-susceptible isolates. However, multidrug resistant Klebsiella, Proteus, Serratia, Cedecea, and Citrobacter were detected. Lastly, similar species grew from human and bovine samples but on genotyping, the isolates were found to be different. Interestingly, human and bovine Staphylococcus aureus were genetically similar (spa-CC435, spa-type t645 corresponding to ST121) but with different susceptibility patterns. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CoNS, Enterococci, Streptococci, and Escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens associated with clinical bovine-mastitis in Kampala, Uganda. Multidrug resistant bacteria are also prevalent. While similar species occurred in humans and cows, transmission was not detected.
TI  - Synthesis, anti-MRSA, and anti-VRE activity of hemin conjugates with amino acids  and branched peptides.
AB  - The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains has necessitated the synthesis of novel antibacterial agents. It was previously shown that naturally occurring metalloporphyrin hemin possesses dark antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. To improve hemin antibacterial activity, we synthesized a number of hemin conjugates with amino acids and branched peptides. Arginine-containing hemin conjugates demonstrated high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant strains in vitro. Most of the synthesized conjugates showed low toxicity against human erythrocytes and leukocytes.
TI  - Analysis of the tolerance of pathogenic enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus to  cell wall active antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tolerance refers to the phenomenon that bacteria do not significantly die when exposed to bactericidal antibiotics. Enterococci are known for their high tolerance to these drugs, but the molecular reasons why they resist killing are not understood. In a previous study we showed that the superoxide dismutase (SOD) is implicated in this tolerance. This conclusion was based on the results obtained with one particular strain of Enterococcus faecalis and therefore the objective of the present communication was to analyse whether dependence of tolerance on active SOD is a general phenomenon for enterococci and another Gram-positive pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Mutants deficient in SOD activity were constructed in pathogenic enterococci. The wild-type sodA gene was cloned into an expression vector and transformed into SOD-deficient strains for complementation with varying levels of SOD activity. Previously constructed SOD-deficient strains of S. aureus were also included in this study. Tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin was then tested. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the dependence on SOD of tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin is a common trait of antibiotic-susceptible pathogenic enterococci. By varying the levels of expression we could also show that tolerance to vancomycin is directly correlated to SOD activity. Interestingly, deletion of the sodA gene in a non-tolerant Enterococcus faecium strain did not further sensitize the mutant to bactericidal antibiotics. Finally, we showed that the SOD enzymes of S. aureus are also implicated in tolerance to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: High tolerance of enterococci to cell wall active antibiotics can be reversed by SOD deficiency.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (BSIs). Most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. We here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in BSIs in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. METHODS: We analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between January 2005 and January 2011. RESULTS: A total of 4,918 episodes of BSI occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). In both patient groups, Gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than Gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). Amongst Gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Amongst Gram-negative organisms, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many BSIs were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. Yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. Cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following BSI compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate distinct BSI pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial substances against multi-drug resistant pathogens from marine sponge symbiont: Citrinin, a secondary metabolite of Penicillium sp.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To Isolate, purify, characterize, and evaluate the bioactive compounds from the sponge-derived fungus Penicillium sp. FF001 and to elucidate its structure. METHODS: The fungal strain FF001 with an interesting bioactivity profile was isolated from a marine Fijian sponge Melophlus sp. Based on conidiophores aggregation, conidia development and mycelia morphological characteristics, the isolate FF001 was classically identified as a Penicillium sp. The bioactive compound was identified using various spectral analysis of UV, high resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra, 1H and 13C NMR spectral data. Further minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) assay and brine shrimp cytotoxicity assay were also carried out to evaluate the biological properties of the purified compound. RESULTS: Bioassay guided fractionation of the EtOAc extract of a static culture of this Penicillium sp. by different chromatographic methods led the isolation of an antibacterial, anticryptococcal and cytotoxic active compound, which was identified as citrinin (1). Further, citrinin (1) is reported for its potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), rifampicin-resistant S. aureus, wild type S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium showed MICs of 3.90, 0.97, 1.95 and 7.81 microg/mL, respectively. Further citrinin (1) displayed significant activity against the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC 3.90 microg/mL), and exhibited cytotoxicity against brine shrimp larvae LD50 of 96 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Citrinin (1) is reported from sponge associated Penicillium sp. from this study and for its strong antibacterial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens including cytotoxicity against brine shrimp larvae, which indicated that sponge associated Penicillium spp. are promising sources of natural bioactive metabolites.
TI  - Evaluation of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  - Rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. We evaluated the accuracy of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (Nanosphere, Inc., Northbrook, IL) for the identification of Gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. The detection of resistance genes (mecA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and vanA or vanB in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis) by the BC-GP assay also was assessed. A total of 186 positive blood cultures (in BacT/Alert FA bottles) with Gram-positive cocci observed with Gram staining were analyzed using the BC-GP assay. The BC-GP results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. Discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat BC-GP testing. The initial BC-GP organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. Only 40% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. The detection of the mecA gene for 69 blood cultures with only S. aureus or S. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. For 3 of 6 cultures with multiple Staphylococcus spp., mecA detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than S. aureus or S. epidermidis. The detection of vanA agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with E. faecalis or E. faecium. Comparison of the mean times to results for each organism group showed that BC-GP results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in Eastern Europe: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) 2004-2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. The current study examined the activity of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected across Eastern Europe between 2004 and 2010. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodologies. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using CLSI interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. This study included 10 295 Gram-negative and 4611 Gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported among 15.3% of Escherichia coli and 39.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in Turkey (30.9%) and Bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. Imipenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were identified only in Turkey. ESBL-positive E. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). Most antimicrobials showed poor activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of Enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. High rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against E. faecium. One-quarter of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with the highest rate in Romania (51.5%); all MRSA were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Antimicrobial resistance is high in much of Eastern Europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. Tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from Eastern Europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - One-year surveillance of ESKAPE pathogens in an intensive care unit of Monterrey, Mexico.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial species from the ESKAPE group (i.e. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species) are frequently resistant to antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to monitor the incidence of ESKAPE pathogens at the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital in Monterrey, Mexico. METHODS: All clinically relevant organisms isolated from June 2011 to June 2012 were included. Identification and susceptibility testing was performed using panels from Sensititre. Resistance to oxacillin, for S. aureus, and the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), for K. pneumonia, were determined as defined by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Also, the presence of vanA and vanB genes was determined in E. faecium vancomycin (VAN)-resistant isolates. RESULTS: The majority of pathogens (64.5%) isolated in the ICU unit were from the ESKAPE group. The organisms most frequently isolated were A. baumannii (15.8%) and P. aeruginosa (14.3%). A high resistance to carbapenems was detected for A. baumannii (75.3%) while 62% of S. aureus isolates were confirmed to be methicillin resistant. Of the K. pneumoniae isolates, 36.9% were ESBL producers. We detected three E. faecium VAN-resistant isolates, all of which contained the vanA gene. CONCLUSION: The presence of the ESKAPE group of pathogens is a major problem in the ICU setting. The results of this study support the implementation of special antimicrobial strategies to specifically target these microorganisms.
TI  - Nasal and perirectal colonization of vancomycin sensitive and resistant enterococci in patients of paediatrics ICU (PICU) of tertiary health care facilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterococci normally inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and are also a potential pathogen in causing nosocomial infections. The increase in antibiotic resistance and transfer of antibiotic resistance gene to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) due to co-colonization has increased its importance in research. The aim of the study was to evaluate local epidemiology of nasal and rectal colonization with Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) and Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) in patients of Paediatrics Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and correlation with clinical and socioeconomic factors. METHODS: The nasal and perirectal swab samples were collected from 110 patients admitted in PICUs of three tertiary care hospitals of Rawalpindi Medical College, Pakistan. The identification of enterococci was done by biochemical tests and by PCR for ddl, vanA and vanB genes. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion and MICs were determined for vancomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and oxacillin only. RESULTS: Out of 220 nasal and perirectal samples, 09 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and 76 vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), consisting of 40 E. faecalis and 45 E. faecium were isolated. PCR successfully identified both species with ddl primers and VRE with vanA primer. With disc diffusion method, all isolates were resistant to most of the antibiotics tested except linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. VRE showed resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin both and none was resistant to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Generally, E. faecium isolates were more resistant than E. faecalis. MICs of vancomycin for nasal and perirectal VRE were 512 mg/L and 64 to 512 mg/L respectively. VRE were more in patients with prolonged hospitalization, from urban localities and those having pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Present study reveals high colonization and antibiotic resistance in enterococcal isolates from nasal and perirectal area. Nasal colonization by enterococci in PICU is more alarming as VRE may cause infection and can transfer this resistance gene to other microorganisms like S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against Gram-positive pathogens collected in Europe, Latin America, and selected countries in the Asia-Pacific Region (2011).
AB  - We report the results of the international daptomycin surveillance programs for Europe, Latin America, and selected Asia-Pacific nations. A total of 7948 consecutive Gram-positive organisms of clinical significance were collected in 2011 and susceptibility tested against daptomycin and various comparator agents by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. M07-A9. Methods for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically; approved standard: ninth edition Wayne, PA: CLSI. 2012.; Cubicin Package Insert 2012. Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Lexington, MA. Available at http://www.cubicin.com/pdf/PrescribingInformation.pdf. Accessed January 1, 2012.) broth microdilution methods. The test medium was adjusted to contain physiological levels of calcium (50 mg/L) when testing daptomycin. Daptomycin exhibited potent activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus overall and for each region (MIC(50/90), 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL), with susceptibility rates at 100.0% in Latin America, Australia/New Zealand, and India, and at 99.9% in Europe. The daptomycin MIC(50/90) for coagulase-negative staphylococci was also at 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL, and only 1 isolate was considered nonsusceptible with a MIC value at 2 mug/mL. Daptomycin was also highly active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90), 1/1-2 mug/mL) and E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mug/mL for both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant isolates). All enterococcal isolates were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC, </=4 mug/mL) and tigecycline. Susceptibility to linezolid for E. faecalis was at 100.0%, while for E. faecium regional susceptibility rates were at 100.0% except in Europe (99.0%). Viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/1 mug/mL) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mug/mL) continue to be very susceptible to daptomycin. In summary, the results of this investigation document the high potency and wide spectrum of daptomycin when tested against a large resistance-surveillance collection of Gram-positive pathogens and indicate that daptomycin nonsusceptibility remains rare among indicated species after many years of clinical use worldwide.
TI  - Safety assessment and probiotic evaluation of Enterococcus faecium YF5 isolated from sourdough.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium YF5, a strain previously isolated from sourdough, was assessed for safety and probiotic potential. Its virulence and antibiotic resistant phenotypes (cytolysin and gelatinase production, antibiotic susceptibility) and genes (cylA, gelE, ace, agg, esp, and vanA) were surveyed. Results indicated that the tested virulence determinants were nontoxic. In addition, E. faecium YF5 was sensitive to 3 antibiotics such as amoxicillin, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol. Furthermore, results of in vivo animal acute oral toxicity of E. faecium YF5 studies were similar to the control group that indicated no abnormalities. In addition, E. faecium YF5 stably survived in low pH, bile salts, gastric, and intestinal fluids in vitro. Moreover, E. faecium YF5 was found to adhere to human colon cancer cell line HT-29 at 3.39 (+/-0.67) x 10(5) CFU/mL. When cocultured with pathogenic organisms (Enterobacter sakazakii CMCC45402, Escherichia coli CMCC44102, enterohemorrhage Escherichia coli O157: H7 CMCC44828, Salmonella Typhimurium CMCC50071, Shigella flexneri 301, and Shigella sonnei ATCC 29930) and 2 gram-positive strains (Listeria monocytogenes CMCC54001 and Staphylococcus aureus CMCC 26003), it inhibited these foodborne pathogens with exception of S. aureus. Therefore, E. faecium YF5 can be regarded as a safe strain and it may be used as a probiotic preparation or for microecologics.
TI  - An international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: ZAAPS Program results for 2011.
AB  - Through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant Gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and Hong Kong. Linezolid MIC90 values were 2 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the MIC90 value was 1 mug/mL for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. All S. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/mL. Three (0.3%) of 928 strains of CoNS had a linezolid MIC of 4 mug/mL and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in L3. There were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (Brazil [5], France [1], Germany [2] Greece [2], Italy [2], Ireland [1], and Spain [1]) representing 5 species (E. faecium, S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. lugdenensis). A mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid MIC values; one was a S. haemolyticus isolate with a MIC at 4 mug/mL. Resistance rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 ZAAPS Program: CoNS, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among S aureus, S. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected. As the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.
TI  - Clinical relevance of the ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - In recent years, the Infectious Diseases Society of America has highlighted a faction of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) - acronymically dubbed 'the ESKAPE pathogens' - capable of 'escaping' the biocidal action of antibiotics and mutually representing new paradigms in pathogenesis, transmission and resistance. This review aims to consolidate clinically relevant background information on the ESKAPE pathogens and provide a contemporary summary of bacterial resistance, alongside pertinent microbiological considerations necessary to face the mounting threat of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity of Methanol Extracts of Crabapple Mangrove Tree (Sonneratia caseolaris Linn.) Against Multi-Drug Resistant Pathogens.
AB  - The crabapple mangrove tree, Sonneratia caseolaris Linn. (Family: Sonneratiaceae), is one of the foreshore plants found in estuarine and tidal creek areas and mangrove forests. Bark and fruit extracts from this plant have previously been shown to have an anti-oxidative or cytotoxic effect, whereas flower extracts of this plant exhibited an antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. According to the traditional folklore, it is medicinally used as an astringent and antiseptic. Hence, this investigation was carried out on the extract of the leaves, pneumatophore and different parts of the flower or fruit (stamen, calyx, meat of fruit, persistent calyx of fruit and seeds) for antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. The antibacterial activity was evaluated against five antibiotic-sensitive species (three Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria) and six drug-resistant species (Gram-positive i.e. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Gram-negative i.e. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-Escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant-Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acenetobacter baumannii). The methanol extracts from all tested parts of the crabapple mangrove tree exhibited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but was mainly a bactericidal against the Gram-negative bacteria, including the multidrug-resistant strains, when compared with only bacteriostatic on the Gram-positive bacteria. Using Soxhlet apparatus, the extracts obtained by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate revealed no discernable antibacterial activity and only slightly, if at all, reduced the antibacterial activity of the subsequently obtained methanol extract. Therefore, the active antibacterial compounds of the crabapple mangrove tree should have a rather polar structure.
TI  - Effect of Ottoman Viper (Montivipera xanthina (Gray, 1849)) Venom on Various Cancer Cells and on Microorganisms.
AB  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of Montivipera xanthina venom against LNCaP,  MCF-7, HT-29, Saos-2, Hep3B, Vero cells and antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial and fungal species: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli O157H7, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Enterococcus faecium DSM 13590, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. typhimirium CCM 5445, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6957 and Candida albicans ATCC 10239 were studied for evaluating the potential medical benefit of this snake venom. Cytotoxicity of venom was determined using MTT assay. Snake venom cytotoxicity was expressed as the venom dose that killed 50 % of the cells (IC50). The antimicrobial activity of venom was studied by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disc diffusion assay. MIC was determined using broth dilution method. The estimated IC50 values of venom varied from 3.8 to 12.7 or from 1.9 to 7.2 mug/ml after treatment with crude venom for 24 or 48 h for LNCaP, MCF-7, HT-29 and Saos-2 cells. There was no observable cytotoxic effect on Hep3B and Vero cells. Venom exhibited the most potent activity against C. albicans (MIC, 7.8 mug/ml and minimal fungicidal concentration, 62.5 mug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC, 31.25 mug/ml). This study is the first report showing the potential of M. xanthina venom as an alternative therapeutic approach due to its cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects.
TI  - Update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the USA: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011).
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. DAL potency was assessed in the 2011 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9 US Census regions. Monitored Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus (SA; 1,036/50.4% MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 115), Enterococcus faecalis (25), E. faecium (31), Streptococcus pyogenes (155), Streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (VGS; 40). All susceptibility (S) testing used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. DAL (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/mL) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (DAP) and vancomycin (VAN), respectively against SA, with MSSA and MRSA having the same MIC(90) results. CoNS was slightly more DAL-S (MIC(50), </=0.03mug/mL). The highest staphylococcal DAL MIC was only 0.25 mug/mL. beta-Haemolytic streptococci (betaHS) and VGS had DAL MIC results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/mL (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL), and only enterococci showed elevated DAL MIC results. VanA phenotype-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecium had DAL MIC values at >/=1 mug/mL; VanB strains were DAL-S (MIC, </=0.25 mug/mL). All cited DAL quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of MIC creep. In conclusion, year 2011 SENTRY Program data for DAL documents sustained potent activity against SA, CoNS, betaHS, VGS, and VAN-S enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than VAN, DAP, or linezolid.
TI  - Westerdykella reniformis sp. nov., producing the antibiotic metabolites melinacidin IV and chetracin B.
AB  - Westerdykella reniformis Ebead & Overy sp. nov. is described based on morphology  and phylogenetic analyses using ITS, nLSU rDNA, and beta-tubulin gene sequences. Westerdykella reniformis is characterized by the production of cleistothecioid ascomata, containing small globose to subglobose asci with 32, aseptate, dark colored, pronouncedly reniform ascospores having a concave central groove. The isolate was obtained from a red alga (Polysiphonia sp.) collected from the tidal zone in Canada at low tide. Organic extracts enriched in extrolites, obtained from fermentation on a rice-based media, inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), S. warneri, and Proteus vulgaris. Presented here is the identification of the compounds responsible for the observed antimicrobial activity, the taxonomic description of W. reniformis, and a dichotomous key to the known species of Westerdykella based on macro- and micromorphological characters.
TI  - Independent risk factors for the co-colonization of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the region most endemic for vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolation.
AB  - In the majority of cases of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VR E. faecalis) served as the vanA donor to S. aureus. Previous studies that evaluated the risk factors for co-colonization with VRE and MRSA did not differentiate between VR E. faecalis and VR E. faecium. This study aimed to identify variables associated with VR E. faecalis and MRSA co-colonization. A retrospective case-control study from January 2008 to December 2009 was conducted at the Detroit Medical Center. Data were extracted from charts and pharmacy records. Unique patients co-colonized with VR E. faecalis and MRSA (defined as isolation of MRSA within 7 days of VR E. faecalis isolation) were compared with patients with VR E. faecalis who were not co-colonized with MRSA. A total of 546 patients with VR E. faecalis isolation were identified. 85 (15.6 %) VR E. faecalis patients were co-colonized with MRSA and 461 (84.4 %) VR E. faecalis patients were not co-colonized with MRSA. The mean age of the study cohort was 65.9 +/- 16.4 years, 424 (77.7 %) were African-American, and 270 (49.5 %) were residing in long-term care institutions. Independent predictors of co-colonization of VR E. faecalis and MRSA were male gender, impaired consciousness, ICU stay prior to VR E. faecalis isolation, indwelling devices, and isolation of VR E. faecalis from wounds. MRSA was frequently isolated from the same culture specimen as VR E. faecalis (n = 39, 45.9 %), most commonly from wounds. This large study of patients with VR E. faecalis identified the severity of illness, indwelling devices, and chronic wounds as independent predictors of co-colonization with VR E. faecalis and MRSA.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) polyphenols.
AB  - We investigated the antimicrobial properties of polyphenol-rich fractions derived from raw shelled and roasted salted pistachios. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), food and clinical isolates, of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mirabilis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus), the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis and the fungus Aspergillus niger were used. Pistachio extracts were active against Gram-positive bacteria with a bactericidal effect observed against L. monocytogenes (ATCC strains and food isolates), S. aureus and MRSA clinical isolates. Extracts from raw shelled pistachios were more active than those from roasted salted pistachios. The bactericidal activity of pistachio extracts could be used to help control the growth of some microorganisms in foods to improve safety and may find application as a topical treatment for S. aureus.
TI  - Recent trends in resistance to cell envelope-active antibacterial agents among key bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cell envelope-active agents, particularly beta-lactams, play a pivotal role in the treatment of bacterial infections and the extent to which their activity is affected by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is of concern. We analyzed the Surveillance Network (TSN) database to evaluate resistant trends for key cell envelope-active drugs among ESKAPE pathogens. Analysis demonstrated that the activity of these drugs has been notably influenced by the emergence of multidrug resistance; this was especially evident for the beta-lactam drugs. For example, Acinetobacter baumannii resistance to imipenem increased from 23.9% to 34.3%, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 37.0% to 49.7% between 2007 and 2011. During the same time period Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to imipenem increased from 0.8% to 3.8%. As beta-lactams are a cornerstone of anti-infective therapy, it is important to closely monitor the activity of the agents being used today and to aggressively pursue new strategies that can augment current drugs and thwart ever-emerging beta-lactam resistance mechanisms that are continuously encountered.
TI  - Verigene(R) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. A key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with BSIs is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. However, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. During the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of BSIs and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. This review focuses on the properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the Verigene((R)) Gram-Positive Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GP), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria associated with BSIs, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Listeria spp., and Enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (mecA, vanA, and vanB). Based on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between BC-GP test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree of agreement for identification of mecA-mediated meticillin resistance in S. aureus and S. epidermidis organisms and vanA- or vanB-mediated vancomycin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium organisms.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 5-halogenomethylsulfonyl- benzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives.
AB  - A series of 5-halogenomethylsulfonylbenzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives was synthesized as potential antibacterial agents. A new method of synthesis of benzimidazoles was developed. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were tested against a series of reference and clinical strains. The reference strains include Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, B. cereus, E. hirae, M. luteus) and Gram-negative rods (E. coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, B. bronchiseptica). The clinical strains include six methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and two methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) S. aureus strains, one methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, three E. faecalis and two E. faecium strains. Compound with trifluoromethyl- substituent at C-2 position (4) displayed significant antibacterial activities comparable with nitrofurantoin against four strains, and higher against Micrococcus luteus. MIC values for clinical Staphylococci strains (MRSA) were 12.5-25 mug/mL; for Enterococcus strains these values were 50-100 mug/mL. MIC values for reference and clinical strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus group were similar, respectively.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin and comparators against selected groups of Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Telavancin is a novel, rapidly cidal, dual-action glycopeptide. This study examined its in vitro activity against relevant Gram-positive pathogens, comprising 99 meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 40 meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 79 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 45 Enterococcus faecalis, 60 Enterococcus faecium, 40 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 60 Streptococcus pneumoniae. Except with VanA enterococci, telavancin MICs were tightly clustered and unimodal. Telavancin MICs for staphylococci ranged from </=0.03 mg/L to 0.5mg/L, with no shift for MRSA or MSSA in relation to vancomycin MIC. Nevertheless, and independently of species, CoNS with raised vancomycin MICs had reduced susceptibility to telavancin, however this was much more marked for teicoplanin. Modal telavancin MICs were 0.5mg/L and </=0.03 mg/L for glycopeptide-susceptible E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively, with no rise for VanB isolates, but ranges rose to 4-16 mg/L and 1-4 mg/L for VanA isolates, respectively. Streptococci were consistently susceptible, with MICs of </=0.06 mg/L. Telavancin MICs by Etest agreed within 1 doubling dilution with those found previously by BSAC agar dilution in 96.2% of cases, although with slight bias towards lower values. In the few cases (13/345) where telavancin MICs by Etest were >/=2 doubling dilutions different from those by agar dilution, the Etest value was always lower; this effect was greater for the other antibiotics tested. Telavancin had excellent activity, except against enterococci with VanA, with no erosion of this activity against MRSA with raised vancomycin MICs. MICs by Etest were nearly always within 1 dilution of those by BSAC agar dilution.
TI  - Improving linezolid use decreases the incidence of resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms.
AB  - Surveillance studies have shown the emergence of infections with linezolid-resistant bacteria. The relationship between appropriate linezolid use and the spread of linezolid resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms in a single tertiary referral centre was evaluated. In an initial observational study, a prospective prescription-indication study was conducted on intensive care areas and haematology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery and nephrology wards during 2009. An intervention through follow-up feedback on audit results from May-June 2010 was then conducted. From July-December 2010, a second drug-use study of linezolid was conducted, with the same objectives and methodology. To assess the antimicrobial pressure of linezolid, an ecological study was conducted from 2006-2010 in the same hospital wards. Indications for linezolid in the initial study were considered suitable in 38.5% of cases, whilst in the second study the rate was 51.2% (33% increase). Linezolid consumption fell by 57% in the second half of 2010. A significant correlation was found between its inadequate use (DDD/1000 patient-days) and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains/1000 patient-days (r=0.93; P=6.9e-024); 85% of the variability in the incidence of linezolid resistance was predicted by its inadequate use. Its partial correlations were significant for Enterococcus faecium (r=0.407; P=0.049), Staphylococcus epidermidis (r=0.874; P=2.3e-008) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (r=0.406; P=0.049) but not Staphylococcus aureus (r=0.051; P=0.704). A relationship was found between appropriate linezolid use and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains of E. faecium, S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus.
TI  - Design and synthesis of 16-membered cyclopeptides active against vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE).
AB  - The design, synthesis and antibiotic activities of the modified carboxylate binding pocket (D-O-E ring) of vancomycin (1) are summarized in this short account. The preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies indicated that both the structure of the 16-membered macrocycle including the absolute configuration of the modified AA4 unit and the presence of a hydrophobic chain were important for anti-VRE activities of these series of synthetic analogues. Compounds 9c and 9d in which the central amino acid (AA4) of vancomycin was replaced by (2R,3R)-alpha-hydroxy-beta-amino acid and (2R,3R)-alpha,beta-diamino acid, respectively, were found to be useful templates in searching for active compounds against both vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant strains. Two of these compounds (16d and 16n) having an elongated peptide chain at the C-terminal were found to be active against a broad spectrum of both vancomycin-sensitive (Staphylococcus aureus) and -resistant strains (E. faecium, E. faecalis).
TI  - Additional risk factors for infection by multidrug-resistant pathogens in healthcare-associated infection: a large cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of risk factors for healthcare-associated infection (HCAI). The purpose of this study was to identify additional risk factors for HCAI, which are not included in the current definition of HCAI, associated with infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, in all hospitalized infected patients from the community. METHODS: This 1-year prospective cohort study included all patients with infection admitted to a large, tertiary care, university hospital. Risk factors not included in the HCAI definition, and independently associated with MDR pathogen infection, namely MDR Gram-negative (MDR-GN) and ESKAPE microorganisms (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species, carbapenem-hydrolyzing Klebsiella pneumonia and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species), were identified by logistic regression among patients admitted from the community (either with community-acquired or HCAI). RESULTS: There were 1035 patients with infection, 718 from the community. Of these, 439 (61%) had microbiologic documentation; 123 were MDR (28%). Among MDR: 104 (85%) had MDR-GN and 41 (33%) had an ESKAPE infection. Independent risk factors associated with MDR and MDR-GN infection were: age (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.7 and 1.5, p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively), and hospitalization in the previous year (between 4 and 12 months previously) (adjusted OR = 2.0 and 1,7, p = 0.008 and p = 0.048, respectively). Infection by pathogens from the ESKAPE group was independently associated with previous antibiotic therapy (adjusted OR = 7.2, p < 0.001) and a Karnofsky index <70 (adjusted OR = 3.7, p = 0.003). Patients with infection by MDR, MDR-GN and pathogens from the ESKAPE group had significantly higher rates of inadequate antibiotic therapy than those without (46% vs 7%, 44% vs 10%, 61% vs 15%, respectively, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the inclusion of additional risk factors in the current definition of HCAI for MDR pathogen infection, namely age >60 years, Karnofsky index <70, hospitalization in the previous year, and previous antibiotic therapy, may be clinically beneficial for early diagnosis, which may decrease the rate of inadequate antibiotic therapy among these patients.
TI  - Environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  - The risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. Dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant to several classes of antibiotics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. A total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of Bari, Southern Italy. We have isolated multi-drug resistant Enterococci and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. The presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. No Salmonella, Yersinia or Campylobacter species were isolated. Giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. The predominant Enterococcus species were E. faecium (61.6%), E. gallinarum (23.3%) and E. casseliflavus (5.5%). Other species, including E. faecalis were also isolated. These strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. Resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of Enterococcus spp., respectively. Resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the Enterococcus spp. isolated. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. Canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.
TI  - Twenty-five years of shared life with vancomycin-resistant enterococci: is it time to divorce?
AB  - Twenty-five years ago, isolation of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREm) was reported both in the UK and in France. Since then, VREm has spread worldwide in hospitals. Hospital outbreaks appeared to be related to the evolution since the end of 1980s of a subpopulation of E. faecium highly resistant to ampicillin and fluoroquinolones (the so-called clonal complex CC17) that later acquired resistance to vancomycin. CC17 isolates are presumably better adapted than other E. faecium isolates to the constraints of the hospital environment and most contain mobile genetic elements, phage genes, genes encoding membrane proteins, regulatory genes, a putative pathogenicity island and megaplasmids. Colonization and persistence are major features of VREm. Inherent characteristics of E. faecium including a remarkable genome plasticity, in part due to acquisition of IS elements, in particular IS16, have facilitated niche adaptation of this distinct E. faecium subpopulation that is multiply resistant to antibiotics. Quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid are licensed for the treatment of VREm infections, with linezolid often used as a first-line treatment. However, the emergence of plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid by production of a Cfr methyltransferase in Enterococcus faecalis is worrying. Daptomycin has not been extensively evaluated for the treatment of VREm infections and resistant mutants have been selected under daptomycin therapy. Although control of VRE is challenging, a laissez-faire policy would result in an increased number of infections and would create an irreversible situation. Although so far unsuccessful, dissemination of glycopeptide-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with van genes acquired from resistant enterococci cannot be ruled out.
TI  - Assessment of safe enterococci as bioprotective cultures in low-acid fermented sausages combined with high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  - Three bacteriocinogenic, non-aminogenic and non-virulent Enterococcus strains (Enterococcus faecium CTC8005, Enterococcus devriesei CTC8006 and Enterococcus casseliflavus CTC8003) were used as starter cultures in low-acid fermented sausages to assess their competitiveness and their bioprotective potential against Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The inoculated strains were successfully monitored by RAPD-PCR. All the strains were able to grow, survive and dominate the endogenous enterococci population and avoided the growth of Enterobacteriaceae. E. devriesei CTC8006 and E. faecium CTC8005 particularly inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes during the whole ripening process. S. aureus was not affected by the inoculated bacteriocinogenic enterococci strains. The application of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment (600 MPa for 5 min) at the end of ripening (day 21) produced an immediate reduction in the counts of Enterobacteriaceae to levels <1 log cfu/g and promoted a decrease of 1-log unit in the counts of S. aureus. E. faecium CTC8005, which reduced the counts of L. monocytogenes ca. 2 log cfu/g immediately after stuffing and in combination with HHP treatment promoted a further reduction of 1 log cfu/g in the pathogen counts. The combination of E. faecium CTC8005 and HHP was the most efficient antilisterial approach.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acid exhibit potent bactericidal activity against ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - A series of 36 synthetic antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids  were screened to determine their effectiveness to treat Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens, which are known to commonly infect chronic wounds. The primary amino acid sequences of these peptides incorporate either three or six dipeptide units consisting of the unnatural amino acids Tetrahydroisoquinolinecarboxylic acid (Tic) and Octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (Oic). The Tic-Oic dipeptide units are separated by SPACER amino acids with specific physicochemical properties that control how these peptides interact with bacterial cell membranes of different chemical compositions. These peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against these pathogens in the range from >100 to 6.25 mug/mL. The observed diversity of MIC values for these peptides against the various bacterial strains are consistent with our hypothesis that the complementarity of the physicochemical properties of the peptide and the lipid of the bacteria's cell membrane determines the resulting antibacterial activity of the peptide.
TI  - ZAAPS Program results for 2010: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from 75 medical centres in 24 countries.
AB  - The Zyvox(R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program monitors the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents for Gram-positive organisms in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific. For the 2010 Program a total of 6305 Gram-positive strains were collected from 75 medical centres on five continents (24 countries). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on organisms from the following groups: Staphylococcus aureus (2875), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (855), enterococci (787), Streptococcus pneumoniae (926), viridans group and other streptococci (325), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (507). Linezolid demonstrated a 99.81% susceptibility rate among 6305 strains tested from 24 nations. Of the resistant isolates, four linezolid-resistant strains of enterococci (two each for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) were found in four nations (China, Thailand, Germany, and Brazil). Eight CoNS (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis) isolates were observed to be resistant to linezolid (MIC, >/=8 mug/ml). Two strains from Mexico were determined to be from an ongoing epidemic, and investigations showed that isolates from Italy and Brazil were also from circulating resistant clones discovered in earlier years. MRSA rates varied by region and between nations, as did resistances to other potential therapeutic agent options frequently listed for MRSA therapy such as clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In summary, the 2010 ZAAPS Program demonstrated that linezolid activity remains stable around the world with >99% susceptibility.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - Ultraviolet disinfection of antibiotic resistant bacteria and their antibiotic resistance genes in water and wastewater.
AB  - Disinfection of wastewater treatment plant effluent may be an important barrier for limiting the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARBs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). While ideally disinfection should destroy ARGs, to prevent horizontal gene transfer to downstream bacteria, little is known about the effect of conventional water disinfection technologies on ARGs. This study examined the potential of UV disinfection to damage four ARGs, mec(A), van(A), tet(A), and amp(C), both in extracellular form and present within a host ARBs: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), Escherichia coli SMS-3-5, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 01, respectively. An extended amplicon-length quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was developed to enhance capture of ARG damage events and also to normalize to an equivalent length of target DNA ( approximately 1000 bp) for comparison. It was found that the two Gram-positive ARBs (MRSA and VRE) were more resistant to UV disinfection than the two Gram-negative ARBs (E. coli and P. aeruginosa). The two Gram-positive organisms also possessed smaller total genome sizes, which could also have reduced their susceptibility to UV because of fewer potential pyrimidine dimer targets. An effect of cell type on damage to ARGs was only observed in VRE and P. aeruginosa, the latter potentially because of extracellular polymeric substances. In general, damage of ARGs required much greater UV doses (200-400 mJ/cm(2) for 3- to 4-log reduction) than ARB inactivation (10-20 mJ/cm(2) for 4- to 5-log reduction). The proportion of amplifiable ARGs following UV treatment exhibited a strong negative correlation with the number of adjacent thymines (Pearson r < -0.9; p < 0.0001). ARBs surviving UV treatment were negatively correlated with total genome size (Pearson r < -0.9; p < 0.0001) and adjacent cytosines (Pearson r < -0.88; p < 0.0001) but positively correlated with adjacent thymines (Pearson r > 0.85; p < 0.0001). This suggests that formation of thymine dimers is not the sole mechanism of ARB inactivation. Overall, the results indicate that UV is limited in its potential to damage ARGs and other disinfection technologies should be explored.
TI  - [Daptomycin for the treatment of gram-positive infections after cardiac surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHOD: Surgical infection remains a main cause of death after heart surgery, despite advances in pharmacological therapy. Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, useful in gram-positive organisms resistant to standard treatment, including vancomycin. The aim of this study was to describe the use of daptomycin regarding efficacy, efficiency and safety in patients with gram-positive infections after heart surgery using a retrospective analysis on 49 adult patients. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin shows excellent in vitro and in vivo activity against gram-positive organisms, such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, especially MRSA. Daptomycin is also effective against increasing vancomycin-resistant or vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus.
TI  - Biocidal activity of metalloacid-coated surfaces against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)  has been recently described. The metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (H3O+), which creates an acidic pH that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. We determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. METHODS: Metalloacid-coated and non-coated (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/mL. Eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two Staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate MRSA Mu50 strain and a ST80-PVL-producing MRSA strain); a vancomycin-resistant vanA Enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains; a MBL-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain; a toxin-producing Clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus). The assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. RESULTS: Against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). Microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.
TI  - Rapid identification of Gram-positive pathogens and their resistance genes from positive blood culture broth using a multiplex tandem RT-PCR assay.
AB  - The early initiation of targeted antibiotic therapy in patients with bacteraemia  and septic shock impacts favourably on outcomes. Rapid methods are therefore increasingly employed for bacterial identification directly from positive blood culture bottles, but with variable success. We evaluated the performance of the Gram Positive 12 multiplex tandem PCR (MT-PCR) assay (AusDiagnostics; catalogue no. 6202, version 07) containing targets for the identification of staphylococci including Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci including Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and their common antibiotic resistance genes (mecA, vanA, vanB). A total of 673 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture broths demonstrating Gram-positive cocci on microscopy were analysed in parallel with traditional phenotypic methods. Amplification of the internal control was inhibited in 79/673 (11.7 %) samples; however, MT-PCR identification was in concordance with phenotypic identification to the genus level in 96.6 % (537/556) of the remaining monomicrobial specimens and to the species level, where applicable, in 100 % (172/172) of samples. MT-PCR identification for 94.7 % (36/38) of polymicrobial samples matched traditional phenotypic identification. Meticillin and vancomycin susceptibility results determined by MT-PCR in blood culture broths demonstrated complete agreement with those determined by phenotypic methods in all 143 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and eight E. faecium isolates, respectively. Gram-positive pathogens and their key antibiotic resistance markers were reliably identified with the MT-PCR assay within 3 h of a positive blood culture result.
TI  - Screen for agents that induce autolysis in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The growing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections underscores the need to discover new antibiotics and to use them with maximum effectiveness. In response to these needs, we describe a screening protocol for the discovery of autolysis-inducing agents that uses two Bacillus subtilis reporter strains, SH-536 and BAU-102. To screen chemical libraries, autolysis-inducing agents were first identified with a BAU-102-based screen and then subdivided with SH-536 into two major groups: those that induce autolysis by their direct action on the cell membrane and those that induce autolysis secondary to inhibition of cell wall synthesis. SH-536 distinguishes between the two groups of autolysis-inducing agents by synthesizing and then releasing beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) in late stationary phase at a time that cells have nearly stopped growing and are therefore tolerant of cell wall synthesis inhibitors. Four hits, named compound 2, compound 3, compound 5, and compound 24, obtained previously as inducers of autolysis by screening a 10,080-compound discovery library with BAU-102, were probed with SH-536 and found to release beta-Gal, indicating that their mode of action was to permeabilize the B. subtilis cell membrane. The four primary hits inhibited growth in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus anthracis, with MICs in the 12.5- to 25-mug/ml (20 to 60 muM) range. The four primary hits were further used to probe B. subtilis, and their action was partially characterized with respect to the dependence of induced autolysis on specific autolysins.
TI  - Estimating the burden of healthcare-associated infections caused by selected multidrug-resistant bacteria Finland, 2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) and antibiotic resistance is important for resource allocation in infection control. Although national surveillance networks do not routinely cover all HAIs due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, estimates are nevertheless possible: in the EU, 25,000 patients die from such infections annually. We assessed the burden of HAIs due to multidrug-resistant bacteria in Finland in 2010. METHODS: By combining data from the National Infectious Disease Registry on the numbers of bacteremias caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., and susceptibility data from the National Antimicrobial Resistance Network and the Finnish Hospital Infection Program, we assessed the numbers of healthcare-associated bacteremias due to selected multidrug-resistant bacteria. We estimated the number of pneumonias, surgical site and urinary tract infections by applying the ratio of these infections in the first national prevalence survey for HAI in 2005. Attributable HAI mortality (3.2%) was also derived from the prevalence survey. RESULTS: The estimated annual number of the most common HAIs due to the selected multidrug-resistant bacteria was 2804 (530 HAIs per million), 6% of all HAIs in Finnish acute care hospitals. The number of attributable deaths was 89 (18 per million). CONCLUSIONS: Resources for infection control should be allocated not only in screening and isolation of carriers of multidrug-resistant bacteria, even when they are causing a small proportion of all HAIs, but also in preventing all clinical infections.
TI  - False daptomycin-nonsusceptible MIC results by Microscan panel PC 29 relative to  Etest results for Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci.
AB  - This study correlated the daptomycin MIC results obtained by Microscan and by Etest in Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci and found that the Microscan panel GP 29 had a high rate of false nonsusceptible results. Of the isolates interpreted as nonsusceptible by Microscan, 87% of Staphylococcus aureus, 90% of Enterococcus faecalis, and 88% of Enterococcus faecium isolates were interpreted as susceptible by Etest. In turn, Etest also has false nonsusceptible results compared to reference methods.
TI  - Influence of the N- and C-terminal regions of antimicrobial peptide pleurocidin on antibacterial activity.
AB  - Pleurocidin, a 25-mer antimicrobial peptide, has been known to exhibit potent antibacterial activity. To investigate the functional roles in N- and C-terminal regions of pleurocidin on the antibacterial activity, we designed four truncated analogs. The antibacterial susceptibility testing showed that pleurocidin and its analogs exerted antibacterial effect against various bacterial strains and further possessed specific activity patterns corresponding with their hydrophobic scale [pleurocidin &gt; Anal 3 (1-22) > Anal 1 (4-25) > Anal 4 (1-19) > Anal 2 (7-25)]. Fluorescence experiments using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide [diSC3(5)] indicated that the differences in antibacterial activity of the peptides were caused by its membrane-active mechanisms including membrane disruption and depolarization. Blue shift in tryptophan fluorescence demonstrated that the decrease in net hydrophobicity attenuates the binding affinity of pleurocidin to interact with plasma membrane. Therefore, the present study suggests that hydrophobicity in the N- and C-terminal regions of pleurocidin plays a key role in its antibacterial activity.
TI  - Epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis: a case-case-control study.
AB  - Although much is known about vancomycin-resistant (VR) Enterococcus faecium, little is known about the epidemiology of VR Enterococcus faecalis. The predilection of VR E. faecalis to transfer the vancomycin resistance determinant to Staphylococcus aureus is much greater than that of VR E. faecium. The epidemiology of VR E. faecalis has important implications regarding the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA); 8 of 13 reported VRSA cases have been from Michigan. A retrospective case-case-control study was conducted at the Detroit Medical Center, located in southeastern Michigan. Unique patients with VR E. faecalis infection were matched to patients with strains of vancomycin-susceptible (VS) E. faecalis and to uninfected controls at a 1:1:1 ratio. Five hundred thirty-two VR E. faecalis cases were identified and were matched to 532 VS E. faecalis cases and 532 uninfected controls. The overall mean age of the study cohort (n = 1,596) was 63.0 +/- 17.4 years, and 747 (46.8%) individuals were male. Independent predictors for the isolation of VR E. faecalis (but not VS E. faecalis) compared to uninfected controls were an age of >/=65 years, nonhome residence, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, exposure to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in the prior 3 months, and immunosuppressive status. Invasive procedures and/or surgery, chronic skin ulcers, and indwelling devices were risk factors for both VR E. faecalis and VS E. faecalis isolation. Cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone exposures were unique, independent predictors for isolation of VR E. faecalis. A majority of case patients had VR E. faecalis present at the time of admission. Control of VR E. faecalis, and ultimately VRSA, will likely require regional efforts focusing on infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship.
TI  - A comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. Whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. The present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (BSIs) using two and three blood culture specimens. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. Each specimen was inoculated into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH, US), and then incubated at 37 degrees C for seven days. RESULTS: Of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. There were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. The recovery rates of true pathogen were 75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first, second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). There were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Among 25 Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3, 10% each). Among 38 Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of BSIs between the two and three blood culture specimens using the VersaTREK blood culture system. Three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.
TI  - Exposure to clinical X-ray radiation does not alter antibiotic susceptibility or  genotype profile in gram-negative and gram-positive clinical pathogens.
AB  - Inadvertent exposure of bacterial pathogens to X-ray radiation may be an environmental stress, where the bacterium may respond by increasing mutational events, thereby potentially resulting in increased antibiotic resistance and alteration to genotypic profile. In order to examine this, four clinical pathogens, including the Gram-negative organisms Escherichia coli O157:H7 NCTC12900 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC10662, as well as the Gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus NCTC6571 and Enterococcus faecium were exposed to X-rays (35,495 cGy/cm2) over a seven-day period. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed before, during and after exposure by examining susceptibility, as quantified by E-test with six antibiotics, as well as to a further 11 antibiotics by measurement of susceptibility zone sizes (mm). Additionally, the DNA profile of each organism was compared before, during and after exposure employing the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction (ERIC PCR). Results indicated that exposure of these organisms to this amount of X-ray radiation did not alter their antibiotic susceptibility, nor their genomic DNA profile. Overall, these data indicate that exposure of bacteria to X-ray radiation does not alter the test organisms' antibiotic susceptibility profiles, nor alter genomic DNA profiles of bacteria, which therefore does not compromise molecular epidemiological tracking of bacteria within healthcare environments in which patients have been exposed to X-ray radiation.
TI  - Therapy of 1,025 severely ill patients with complicated infections in a German multicenter study: safety profile and efficacy of tigecycline in different treatment modalities.
AB  - This large prospective non-interventional study investigated the effects of tigecycline either as single agent or in combination with other antimicrobial agents in 1,025 patients treated in clinical routine at German hospitals. Sixty-five percent of the patients had APACHE II scores > 15, indicating high overall disease severity. Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) or complicated skin and skin tissue infections (cSSTI) were the most common indications, with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Escherichia coli being the most frequently isolated pathogens. Clinical success was reported at the end of tigecycline therapy in 74.2% of the total population, in 75.4% of the cIAI and in 82.2% of the cSSTI patients. The subpopulation (28.0% of the patients) infected with multidrug-resistant pathogens (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers and vancomycin-resistant enterococci) were treated with similar success rates as the overall population. Tigecycline was generally well tolerated. Drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in 7.7% of the total population; 2.5% had serious AEs mostly attributable to inefficacy of therapy or deterioration of the disease. Mortality rates were consistent with the types of infection and severity of illness. There was no indication of excessive mortality associated with tigecycline as had been suggested in previously performed meta-analyses. In this large non-interventional study performed in the clinical routine setting, tigecycline achieved favorable clinical success rates in a patient population with high severity of illness and a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogens and showed a good safety and tolerability profile.
TI  - The changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in Europe: trends from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System.
AB  - We investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in Europe. Aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. Trend analyses used generalized linear models. Robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. From 2002 to 2008, the overall number of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. In the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% CI 6.9-7.5%). The frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in E. coli and Enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. Bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% CI 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year; 95% CI -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% CI 3.0-3.7). Increasing rates of E. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. Our data suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during EARSS surveillance. Trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. It appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. As a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.
TI  - Adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  - Adenylate kinase (AK) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. We have shown that AK release serves as a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. The AK assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (SCV) and bacteria within established biofilms. The usefulness of the AK assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including Escherichia coli and all members of the "ESKAPE" pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). The assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. Moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited AK release. Four of these were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. Two of these molecules were further characterized. The antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against S. aureus planktonic, SCV population, and biofilm-associated cells. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, was active toward E. faecium in vitro and also reduced E. faecium pathogenesis in a Galleria mellonella infection model. Our data demonstrate that the AK assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. Further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.
TI  - Three bioactive sesquiterpene quinones from the Fijian marine sponge of the genus Hippospongia.
AB  - A sesquiterpenoid quinone, epi-ilimaquinone (1), and two sesquiterpene amino quinones, smenospongine (2) and glycinylilimaquinone (3), were isolated from the Fijian marine sponge Hippospongia sp. The structures of these compounds were determined by spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1 and 3 were reported for the first time in this study from the sponge of the genus Hippospongia. Compound 1 displayed potent cytotoxic activity and showed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, wild type S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and displayed antifungal activity against amphotericin-resistant Candida albicans while compounds 2 and 3 showed moderate cytotoxic activity. However, compound 1 did not show appreciable antifungal activity against wild type C. albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sporangia or Sordaria sp.
TI  - National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Funding for Studies  of Hospital-Associated Bacterial Pathogens: Are Funds Proportionate to Burden of Disease?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-associated infections (HAIs) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. The pathogens that cause the majority of serious HAIs are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, referred as ESCKAPE. We aimed to determine the amount of funding the National Institute of Health (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly ESCKAPE pathogens. METHODS: The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) database was used to identify NIAID antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." RESULTS: Funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. Antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. The total funding for all ESKCAPE pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. S. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in FY2009, the highest funding amount of all the ESCKAPE pathogens. Based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per S. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per C. difficile related death. CONCLUSIONS: Although the funding for ESCKAPE pathogens has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. Efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.
TI  - Synergistic effects between silver nanoparticles and antibiotics and the mechanisms involved.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (nano-Ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. In this study, the combination effects between nano-Ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. The MIC and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects. The results showed that nano-Ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic activities. The antibiofilm activities of nano-Ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. Formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. The results indicated that nano-Ags also had antibiofilm activities. To understand these effects of nano-Ags, an ATPase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. The antibacterial activity of nano-Ags was influenced by ATP-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. Additionally, nano-Ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. It was concluded that nano-Ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.
TI  - [Linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecium: the first G2576T mutation in Turkey].
AB  - Linezolid which is the first member of oxazolidinone class of synthetic antimicrobial agents, was licensed for the treatment of gram-positive coccal infections in Turkey in 2006. In recent years, multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), have emerged rapidly worldwide and linezolid exhibited good clinical efficacy against VRE. However, linezolid-resistant bacteria have been reported from Turkey. In April 2011, a 66-year-old paraplegic woman was admitted to our hospital because of an infected decubitis ulcer and empirical antibiotic therapy was started. Since the patient's condition worsened during treatment, she was moved to the intensive care unit. Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were recovered from tracheal aspirates and blood, respectively. Following three weeks of linezolid therapy blood culture yielded linezolid and vancomycin resistant E.faecium. Linezolid resistance in the VRE strain was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, subsequently. Linezolid-resistant two isolates were identified as E.faecium by 16S rRNA sequencing and both isolates had G2576U mutation in 23S rRNA gene. Linezolid resistance which was identified in a vancomycin-resistant E.faecium isolate is a new problem for Turkey. Last year another mutation related to linezolid resistance was reported from Istanbul, Turkey. The isolate had G2576T mutated 23S rRNA genes. Resistance should be considered and closely followed-up during linezolid treatment.
TI  - [Interaction of Bifidobacterium bifidum with members of normal microflora in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  - AIM: Study the influence of exometabolites of B. bifidum on biological properties of bacteria that are the members of normoflora and their ability to interact with associative microsymbionts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial strains that are members of the normal microflora of human intestine: B. bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcusfaecium and Escherichia coli lactose positive non-hemolytic (lac "+"/hly "-") were used. As opportunistic microorganisms cultures of E. coli lactose negative hemolytic (lac "-"/hly "+"), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were used. Isolation and identification of microorganisms was performed by generally accepted methods according to guidances. In the first series of experiments influence of B. bifidum metabolites on biological properties of microorganisms that are members ofnormoflora was studied. In the second series--the influence of bifidobacteria supernatants on interrelations of B. bifidum, L. acidophilus and E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" with opportunistic associants. Growth properties (GP), biofilm formation (BFF) and anti-lysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms was studied photometrically. Optical density measurement were performed on ELx808 (BioTek, U.S.A.) photometer. The data obtained were treated by nonparametric method using Mann-Whitney criteria. RESULTS: B. bifidum supernatant was established to stimulate in 33.3-66.7% of cases or did not alter growth/reproduction, BFF and ALA of microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of intestine including bacteria of the same species that could have implications for realization by bifidobacteria ofbiotope colonization resistance. Features of interaction ofexometabolites of bifidobacteria with microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of human intestine consisting in enchantment or changes of effects of the influence of normoflora members on BFF of associants were revealed. The maximum enchantment of inhibitory effect of indigenous strains under the influence ofbifidobacteria was noted in associations E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" E. coli lac "-"/hly "+" as well as E. faecium--S. aureus. CONCLUSION: Thus, the data obtained may be used for detection of mechanisms of functioning of normal microsymbiocenosis in human associative symbiosis.
TI  - Antibacterial spirobisnaphthalenes from the North American cup fungus Urnula craterium.
AB  - Urnucratins A-C (1-3), which possess an unusual bisnaphthospiroether skeleton with one oxygen bridge and one C-C bridge and represent a new subclass of bisnaphthalenes, were isolated from the North American cup fungus Urnula craterium. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were determined by means of HRMS, NMR, and quantum chemical CD calculations. Urnucratin A (1) was found to be active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pyogenes with MIC values of 2, 1, and 0.5 mug/mL, respectively.
TI  - Armeniaspiroles, a new class of antibacterials: Antibacterial activities and total synthesis of 5-chloro-Armeniaspirole A.
AB  - Armeniaspiroles, a novel class of natural products isolated from Streptomyces armeniacus, are characterized by a novel spiro[4.4]non-8-ene scaffold. Various derivatives of Armeniaspiroles could be obtained by halogenation, alkylation, addition/elimination or reductions. A total synthesis of the 5-chloro analog of Armeniaspirole A has been accomplished in a linear six-step sequence. 5-Chloro-Armeniaspirole A exhibits good activity against a range of multidrug-resistant, Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Linezolid-resistant clinical isolates of meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative  staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium from China.
AB  - Seventeen meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), including ten Staphylococcus capitis, four Staphylococcus cohnii, two Staphylococcus haemolyticus and one Staphylococcus sciuri, and an Enterococcus faecium isolate with various levels of linezolid resistance were isolated from intensive care units in a Chinese hospital. PFGE indicated that the four S. cohnii isolates belonged to a clonal strain, and that nine of the S. capitis isolates were indistinguishable (clone A1) and the other one was closely related (clone A2). A G2576T mutation was identified in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene in the E. faecium isolate. Besides the G2576T mutation, a novel C2104T mutation was detected in the nine clone A1 S. capitis isolates. The cfr gene was detected in all the staphylococci except an S. sciuri isolate, whose 23S rRNA gene contained the G2576T mutation. There was a clonal dissemination of linezolid-resistant MRCoNS in intensive care units of our hospital, and this is the first report, to our knowledge, of linezolid-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in China.
TI  - [Psoas abscess after ureteral stent exchange for cutaneous ureterostomy: report of a case].
AB  - A 69-year-old man underwent a radical cystectomy and cutaneous ureterostomy for carcinoma in situ of the urinary bladder. The ureteral stents were exchanged for cutaneous ureterostomy 35 days after the operation. The patient suffered from high fever with chills a few hours after the stent exchange, and was readmitted to our hospital. High fever was not improved by treatment with Ceftriaxone for 5 days. Five days after the stent exchange, computed tomography (CT) revealed a right psoas abscess. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected in the blood culture. Urine culture showed MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium. Computed tomography-guided percutaneous catheter drainage and treatment consisting of vancomycin, minocycline and ciprofloxacin were performed for the psoas abscess. This treatment significantly reduced the size of the abscess and high fever was improved. The catheter was removed 22 days after the drainage. However, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a spondylitis at L4 and L5. Therefore, antibiotics treatment was continued for about 3 months. There has been no sign of recurrence of bladder cancer and psoas abscess at 23 months after the operation.
TI  - Air contamination around patients colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms.
AB  - Care-related infections are a major public health concern. Their transmission can be associated with environmental factors. This study looks at air contamination around 45 patients colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). We found that 30 hospital rooms (67%) were contaminated with MDRO species and 10 rooms (22%) were contaminated with at least 1 MDRO.
TI  - Rapid identification of ESKAPE bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  - This article describes Bacteria ID Chips ('BacChips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. BacChips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. Pressing the layer of PDMS into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). After assembly, BacChips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. To use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased PDMS draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. After the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air is drawn into the BacChip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. A pH indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. Importantly, BacChips operate without external equipment or instruments. By visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that BacChips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the ESKAPE panel of pathogens, including strains of: Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccocus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. This article describes a BacChip for point-of-care detection of ESKAPE pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.
TI  - Total synthesis of marinomycin A using salicylate as a molecular switch to mediate dimerization.
AB  - Antibiotics play a significant role in human health because of their ability to treat life-threatening bacterial infections. The growing problems with antibiotic resistance have made the development of new antibiotics a World Health Organization priority. Marinomycin A is a member of a new class of bis-salicylate-containing polyene macrodiolides, which have potent antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Herein, we describe a triply convergent synthesis of this agent using the salicylate as a novel molecular switch for the chemoselective construction of the macrodiolide. This strategy raises new questions regarding the biosynthetic role of the salicylate and its potential impact on the mechanism of action of these types of agents. For instance, in contrast to penicillin, which enhances the electrophilicity of the cyclic amide through ring strain, salicylates reduce the electrophilicity of the aryl ester through an intramolecular resonance-assisted hydrogen bond to provide an amide surrogate.
TI  - Experience with daptomycin daily dosing in ICU patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy.
AB  - PURPOSE: For critically ill patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), daptomycin dosing recommendations are scarce. We, therefore, retrospectively assessed routinely measured daptomycin plasma concentrations, daptomycin dose administered and microbiological data in 11 critically ill patients with Gram-positive infections that had received daptomycin once daily. METHODS: The retrospective analysis included critically ill patients treated at the intensive care unit (ICU) who had daptomycin plasma concentrations measured. RESULTS: Daptomycin dose ranged from 3 to 8 mg/kg/q24 h in patients undergoing CRRT (n = 7) and 6 to 10 mg/kg/q24 h in patients without CRRT (n = 4). Peak and trough concentrations showed a high intra- and inter-patient variability in both groups, independent of the dosage per kg body weight. No drug accumulation was detected in CRRT patients with once-daily daptomycin dosing. Causative pathogens were Enterococcus faecium (n = 6), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2) and unknown in one patient. Microbiological eradication was successful in 8 of 11 patients. Two of three patients with unsuccessful microbiological eradication and fatal outcome had an Enterococcus faecium infection. CONCLUSION: In critically ill patients undergoing CRRT, daptomycin exposure with once-daily dosing was similar to ICU patients with normal renal function, but lower compared to healthy volunteers. Our data suggest that daptomycin once-daily dosing is appropriate in patients undergoing CRRT.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - Novel model to study combined effects of microorganisms and oxidants on development of intestinal necrosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the cause of intestinal necrosis in diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is multi-factorial, oxidants and bacteria likely are key factors. Many animal models of NEC generate histologic necrosis, but it is rare to see the gross necrosis that is observed in infants. Here, we present a novel model that produces full-thickness intestinal necrosis when chloramine-T, an oxidizing agent, is introduced directly into isolated intestinal loops. The aim of this study was to determine the role of bacteria in this model. METHODS: Three-week-old mice underwent isolated ileal loop construction by suture ligation, and either chloramine-T or saline was injected into the loop. Intestines were then returned to the abdominal cavity, and the incision was closed for 24 h, after which the intestinal loops were analyzed histologically and microbiologically. To determine if bacteria home to the site of injury, some mice had intracecal injection of luminescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). These mice were sacrificed 2, 6, 8, and 24 h later, and luminescent bacteria were localized via photon camera imaging. RESULTS: No gross necrosis was observed in the saline-treated group, but 59% of the animals in the chloramine-T-treated group had necrosis (p<0.001). Relative bacterial species numbers were calculated for untreated control animals and those with saline-treated loops and chloramine-T-treated loops without and with necrosis. Lactobacillus was detected in 60% of the control animals but was absent in all animals that underwent surgery. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, PA, and Enterococcus faecium were present only in animals that underwent loop construction; however, bacterial communities did not differ according to loop treatment or the presence or absence of necrosis. After intracecal injection of PA, bacteria homed to the loop and proximal bowel even though the loop was discontinuous with the remaining bowel. CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal chloramine-T causes full-thickness necrosis in three-week-old mice and is characterized by a loss of probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus. Necrotic loops of bowel become colonized rapidly with pathogenic bacteria by unconventional mechanisms. Oxidant stress and colonization by pathogenic bacteria may play important roles in intestinal necrosis across a wide spectrum of pathologic states, including NEC.
TI  - Volatile organic compound analysis by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry for Gram-positive bacteria differentiation.
AB  - Approximately 50 % of all clinically proven infections in critically ill patients are caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The timely and appropriate treatment of these infections is vital in order to avoid negative outcomes. Hence, fast and reliable methods are needed for the early detection and identification of microorganisms. Recently, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile organic compounds emitted by microorganisms has been employed to study Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report a feasibility study of ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry (IMR-MS) for in vitro growth detection and species differentiation of selected Gram-positive bacteria that are frequently isolated in blood culture samples, namely, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry was used to analyze the headspace above cultures containing Gram-positive bacteria incubated at 37 degrees C starting with 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Measurements to determine the presence of volatile organic compounds were performed 4, 8, and 24 h after incubation, respectively. The detection of microbial growth was accomplished already after 8 h in cultures containing E. faecalis. After 24 h of incubation, characteristic mass spectra were obtained for all species. Processing these mass spectra by hierarchic clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) enabled us to differentiate between bacterial species. IMR-MS in conjunction with a cumulative end-point model provides the means for rapid growth detection and differentiation of Gram-positive bacteria on the species level, typically within an analysis time of less than 3 min per sample.
TI  - [Analysis of distribution characteristics and drug resistance of 2748 strains of  pathogens isolated from burn patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide epidemiological data of the distribution characteristics and drug resistance of the pathogens isolated from burn patients in recent years for guiding rational use of antibiotics in clinic. METHODS: Totally 2748 strains of pathogens were isolated from 1977 specimens (blood, catheter, wound excretion, etc.) collected from 478 patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital from March 2003 to June 2011. After being identified by API strips, drug resistance of the 2748 isolated pathogens to 55 commonly-used antibiotics including gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin, amikacin, etc. was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method. The WHONET 5.3 software was used to analyze the following subjects: the distribution of the pathogens with different types and different sources each year, the changes in drug-resistant rates of Gram negative bacilli, Gram positive cocci, and fungi to several antibiotics, and the changes in sensitive rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Candida albicans (CA) to several antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 2748 strains of pathogens, 1879 strains of Gram negative bacilli accounted for 68.38%, 628 strains of Gram positive cocci accounted for 22.85%, and 241 strains of fungi accounted for 8.77%. The isolation rate of strains from wound excretion ranked the first (1022 strains accounted for 37.19%), followed by those from respiratory tract (995 strains accounted for 36.21%) and blood (421 strains accounted for 15.32%). Strains isolated from other types of specimens were rare. Isolation rate of PA ranked the first (996 strains accounted for 36.24%), followed by SA (495 strains accounted for 18.01%) and AB (395 strains accounted for 14.37%). Isolation rate of AB showed a trend of increase year by year, but that of SA presented the opposite trend. Isolation rate of PA was quite stable. There were 484 strains of methicillin resistant SA among Staphylococci, accounting for 17.61%. Resistant rates of PA and AB to polymyxin B and polymyxin E were below 30.00%, and those of PA and AB to other antibiotics, such as the third generation cephalosporins, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, were from 57.91% to 100.00%. Resistant rate of AB to minocycline was 39.68%. From 2004 to 2011, sensitive rate of PA to quinolone antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year, but that of AB to minocycline, netilmicin, imipenem, meropenem, tobramycin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam presented the opposite trend. Resistant rates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and SA to teicoplanin and linezolid were less than 10.00%. Resistant rate of SA, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium to vancomycin was 0. Resistant rates of SA to quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, fusidic acid, and compound sulfamethoxazole were low, respectively 0.82%, 9.35%, 2.21%, and 31.85%. Sensitive rates of SA to erythromycin, clindamycin, compound sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and minocycline showed an increasing trend year by year. Both infection rate and resistant rate of fungi were low. The resistant rates of CA to 5 kinds of antibiotics were less than 15.00%. The sensitive rate of CA to 5-flucytosine declined slightly, and those of CA to the other 4 antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year. CONCLUSIONS: The three dominant pathogens that cause infection in burn patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital in recent years are PA, SA, and AB in order. PA and AB are outstandingly multidrug-resistant among the isolated strains. AB might replace PA as the main pathogenic bacterium that cause the death of burn patients with infection.
TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the US Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). After intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. Ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant Gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Because of its unique spectrum of activity, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-MRSA activity. The activity of ceftaroline against S. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. Ceftaroline has low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all tested species of streptococci, and has potent activity against S. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. The activity of ceftaroline is limited against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. The in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class B metallo-beta-lactamases or AmpC cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in phase III randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. Two identical trials (CANVAS 1 and CANVAS 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with cSSSI. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (difference -1.1%, 95% CI -4.2, 2.0). An additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the FDA guidance definition of ABSSSI at treatment day 3. Clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% CI 1.3, 14.0). Clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with CAP was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase III trials (FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2). Of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against MRSA, patients with confirmed or suspected MRSA CAP were excluded from the FOCUS trials. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% CI 1.6, 11.8). An additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe CAP and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. CABP). Day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% CI -0.6, 20.6). In the phase III trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. Overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, as well as many common Gram-negative organisms. It is a welcome treatment option for ABSSSI and CABP.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-positive pathogens in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Several species of Gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. Here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in Saudi Arabia. In the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among Staphylococcus aureus in the Kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. As yet, no vancomycin-resistant MRSA have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. Currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (VRE) is low; however, VRE has been described in the Kingdom as well as Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. In recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in Saudi Arabia. The organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. On the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.
TI  - Costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in Manhattan. The main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: Controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [CI], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; CI, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; CI, 1.5-5.4). Patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; CI, 0.01-0.08). CONCLUSIONS: With careful matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. The difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.
TI  - Sesquiterpenes and cyclopeptides from the endophytic fungus Trichoderma asperellum SAMUELS, LIECKF. & NIRENBERG.
AB  - Trichodones A-C (1-3, resp.), three new sesquiterpenes, together with the two known cyclopeptides PF1022F and halobacillin (4 and 5, resp.), have been isolated from the crude extract of the endophytic fungus Trichoderma asperellum SAMUELS, LIECKF. & NIRENBERG residing in the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Panax notoginseng (BURKILL) F.H.CHEN. The structures and configurations of compounds 1-3 were determined by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The relative configuration for 1 was determined by analysis of its pertinent coupling constants and NOESY correlations, whereas the absolute configuration of 1 was established by CD spectroscopy. Compounds 4 and 5 displayed antibacterial activities against Enterococcus faecium (CGMCC 1.2025) with IC(5)(0) values of 7.30 and 5.24 muM, and against Staphylococcus aureus COL (CGMCC 1.2465) with IC(5)(0) values of 19.02 and 14.00 muM, respectively.
TI  - Exploration of the chemical space of novel naphthalene-sulfonamide and anthranilic Acid-based inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins are a well established, validated and still a very promising target for the design and development of new antibacterial agents. Based on our previous discovery of several noncovalent small-molecule inhibitor hits for resistant PBPs we decided to additionally explore the chemical space around these compounds. In order to clarify their structure-activity relationships for PBP inhibition two new series of compounds were synthesized, characterized and evaluated biochemically: the derivatives of anthranilic acid and naphthalene-sulfonamide derivatives. The target compounds were tested for their inhibitory activities on three different transpeptidases: PBP2a from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, PBP5fm from Enterococcus faecium strains, and PBP1b from Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. The most promising results for both of these series of compounds were obtained against the PBP2a enzyme with the IC50 values in the micromolar range. Although these results do not represent a significant breakthrough in the field of noncovalent PBP inhibitors, they do provide useful structure-activity relationship data, and thus a more solid basis for the design of potent and noncovalent inhibitors of resistant PBPs.
TI  - Examining the fish microbiome: vertebrate-derived bacteria as an environmental niche for the discovery of unique marine natural products.
AB  - Historically, marine invertebrates have been a prolific source of unique natural  products, with a diverse array of biological activities. Recent studies of invertebrate-associated microbial communities are revealing microorganisms as the true producers of many of these compounds. Inspired by the human microbiome project, which has highlighted the human intestine as a unique microenvironment in terms of microbial diversity, we elected to examine the bacterial communities of fish intestines (which we have termed the fish microbiome) as a new source of microbial and biosynthetic diversity for natural products discovery. To test the hypothesis that the fish microbiome contains microorganisms with unique capacity for biosynthesizing natural products, we examined six species of fish through a combination of dissection and culture-dependent evaluation of intestinal microbial communities. Using isolation media designed to enrich for marine Actinobacteria, we have found three main clades that show taxonomic divergence from known strains, several of which are previously uncultured. Extracts from these strains exhibit a wide range of activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens, as well as several fish pathogens. Exploration of one of these extracts has identified the novel bioactive lipid sebastenoic acid as an anti-microbial agent, with activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Vibrio mimicus.
TI  - Bacteribilia with resistant microorganisms after preoperative biliary drainage--the influence of bacteria on postoperative outcome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In pancreatic surgery, preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) leads to bacteribilia. Whether positive bile duct cultures are associated with a higher postoperative morbidity might be related to the resistance of the species isolated from bile. STUDY: Intraoperative bile duct cultures were collected from all patients who underwent pancreatic surgery. Postoperative morbidity was analyzed according to the species and the resistance found on bile duct cultures. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent (166/301) of patients had PBD, while 45% (135/301) underwent primary operation. PBD was associated with a positive bile duct culture in 87% (144/166) versus 21% (28/135) in patients without PBD (p = 0.001) and polymicrobial infections in 53% (88/166) versus 6% (8/135) (p = 0.001). Postoperative morbidity was 40% (121/301); mortality was 3% (9/301). PBD was not associated with morbidity and mortality, but resistant species on bile duct cultures lead to significantly more postoperative complications, 54% (25/46) versus 38% (96/255) (p = 0.033), with significantly more antibiotic therapies. CONCLUSION: PBD is associated with polymicrobial infections with resistant microorganisms, resulting in more postoperative complications. Since PBD cannot always be avoided, surgeons and gastroenterologists must be aware of their institutional surveillance data to identify patients at risk for postoperative complications.
TI  - Transferable plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid due to cfr in a human clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Nonmutational resistance to linezolid is due to the presence of cfr, which encodes a methyltransferase responsible for methylation of A2503 in the 23S rRNA. The cfr gene was first described in animal isolates of staphylococci, and more recently, it has been identified in Staphylococcus aureus from human clinical infections, including in an outbreak of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. In enterococci, cfr has been described in an animal isolate of Enterococcus faecalis from China. Here, we report an isolate of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis (603-50427X) recovered from a patient in Thailand who received prolonged therapy with the antibiotic for the treatment of atypical mycobacterial disease. The isolate lacked mutations in the genes coding for 23S rRNA and L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins and belonged to the multilocus sequence type (MLST) 16 (ST16), which is commonly found in enterococcal isolates from animal sources. Resistance to linezolid was associated with the presence of cfr on an ~97-kb transferable plasmid. The cfr gene environment exhibited DNA sequences similar to those of other cfr-carrying plasmids previously identified in staphylococci (nucleotide identity, 99 to 100%). The cfr-carrying plasmid was transferable by conjugation to a laboratory strain of E. faecalis (OG1RF) but not to Enterococcus faecium or S. aureus. The cfr gene was flanked by IS256-like sequences both upstream and downstream. This is the first characterization of the potential horizontal transferability of the cfr gene from a human linezolid-resistant isolate of E. faecalis.
TI  - Epidemiological features and risk factors of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in  intensive care unit patients: 2008-2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Encephalopathy is a common complication of sepsis, and its onset can  occur at any stage of sepsis and implies worse prognosis. However, the incidence, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of sepsis-associated encephalopathy remain controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiological features and risk factors for sepsis-associated encephalopathy. METHODS: Our retrospective study included all patients with sepsis admitted to our intensive care unit from 2008 to 2011. After excluding 91 patients, 232 patients were assigned to either a sepsis-associated encephalopathy group or sepsis without encephalopathy group. Between-group differences in baseline patient data including vital signs, disease severity, pathogens, sites of infection, biochemical indicators, and time on a mechanical ventilator, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and 28-day mortality rate were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of sepsis-associated encephalopathy was 17.7%. The sepsis-associated encephalopathy group had significantly higher 28-day mortality (56.1% vs. 35.1%; P=0.013), spent a significantly longer time on a ventilator ((8.2+/-2.2) days vs. (2.9+/-0.4) days; P=0.021), and had a significantly longer ICU stay ((12.4+/-2.4) days vs. (7.1+/-0.6) days; P=0.042). Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, Glasgow coma scale, heart rate, blood lactate, serum sodium, platelets, serum albumin, and pH values were related to the presence of encephalopathy. Patients with biliary tract infections and intestinal infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were more prone to develop sepsis-associated encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Encephalopathy increases mortality rate in septic patients. Clinical intervention to reduce risk factors and thereby morbidity and mortality depends on a correct understanding of the differences between patients with sepsis and patients with both sepsis and encephalopathy.
TI  - Evaluation of standard- and high-dose daptomycin versus linezolid against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  - Daptomycin MICs for enterococci are typically 1- to 2-fold higher than those for  Staphylococcus aureus, and there is an imminent need to establish the optimal dose for appropriate treatment of enterococcal infections. We investigated the bactericidal activity of daptomycin at various dose exposures compared to that of linezolid against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model utilizing simulated endocardial vegetations over 96 h. Daptomycin at doses of 6, 8, 10, and 12 mg/kg of body weight/day and linezolid at a dose of 600 mg every 12 h were evaluated against two clinical vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains (EFm11499 and 09-184D1051), one of which was linezolid resistant (09-184D1051), and one clinical vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis strain (EFs11496). Daptomycin MICs were 4, 2, and 0.5 mug/ml for EFm11499, 09-184D1051, and EFs11496, respectively. Bactericidal activity, defined as a >/= 3 log(10) CFU/g reduction from the initial colony count, was demonstrated against all three isolates with all doses of daptomycin; however, bactericidal activity was not sustained with the daptomycin 6- and 8-mg/kg/day regimens. Linezolid was bacteriostatic against EFm11499 and displayed no appreciable activity against 09-184D1051 or EFs11496. Concentration-dependent killing was displayed with more sustained reduction in colony count (3.58 to 6.46 and 5.89 to 6.56 log(10) CFU/g) at 96 h for the simulated regimen of daptomycin at doses of 10 and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively (P </= 0.012). No E. faecium mutants with reduced susceptibility were recovered at any dosage regimen; however, the E. faecalis strain developed reduced daptomycin susceptibility with daptomycin at 6, 8, and 10 but not at 12 mg/kg/day. Daptomycin displayed a dose-dependent response against three VRE isolates, with high-dose daptomycin producing sustained bactericidal activity. Further research is warranted.
TI  - Persistence of nosocomial pathogens on various fabrics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fabrics can become contaminated with high numbers of microorganisms that may be pathogenic to patients in a hospital setting and can play an important role in the chain of infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival of several clinical bacterial and fungal isolates on several fabrics commonly used in hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial and fungal survival was tested on the following materials, each of which are commonly used in our hospital: 100% smooth cotton, 60% cotton-40% polyester, 100% wool and 100% silk. One isolate each of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Geotrichum candidum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Escherichia coli, inducible beta-lactamase (IBL) positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa, IBL-positive Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were used to contaminate fabrics. The survival of these microorganisms was studied by testing the fabric swatches for microbial growth. RESULTS: The median survival times for all the tested bacteria and fungi were as follows: 26 days on cotton, 26.5 days on cotton-polyester, 28 days on silk, and 30 days on wool. Among the bacterial species tested, E. faecium had the longest survival time on cotton-polyester fabrics. For the fungal isolates, it was observed that C. tropicalis and C. krusei survived for the shortest amount of time on cotton fabrics in the present study. CONCLUSION: This survival data indicate that pathogenic microorganisms can survive from days to months on commonly used hospital fabrics. These findings indicate that current recommendations for the proper disinfection or sterilization of fabrics used in hospitals should be followed to minimize cross-contamination and prevent nosocomial infections.
TI  - Daptomycin experience in critical care patients: results from a registry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin is often the drug of choice in critically ill patients with gram-positive infections, although circumstances often prevent its use. In these situations, clinicians are frequently left with limited data regarding alternative agents. OBJECTIVE: To describe patients with reported sepsis receiving daptomycin in a critical care unit. METHODS: This multicenter, noncomparative, noninterventional study identified patients in critical care units, using the Cubicin Outcomes Registry and Experience (CORE) 2005-2009 registry. A descriptive account of patient characteristics, infectious etiology, outcomes at the end of daptomycin therapy, and 30-day mortality is reported. Nonevaluable patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis but included in the safety analysis. RESULTS: We identified 128 patients, 98 (77%) of whom were evaluable for efficacy. Patient characteristics for the efficacy population were 55 (56%) males, 30 (31%) aged 66 years or older, 38 (39%) had creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, and 27 (28%) were on dialysis. Common underlying diseases included acute or chronic renal failure 44 (45%), hypertension 40 (41%), and diabetes 27 (28%). Seventy-two (73%) patients were bacteremic. The most common pathogens found were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (32%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (21%), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (20%). Prior to daptomycin, antibiotics were used in 84 (86%) patients, most commonly vancomycin (65/84; 77%). The median (range) initial daptomycin dose was 6 mg/kg (3-10) and duration of 10 days (1-58). Overall success rate was 70% (31% cured; 39% improved). Twelve adverse events possibly related to daptomycin were reported in 9 of 128 (7%) patients in the safety population; 4 of these in 4 (3%) patients were serious. The mortality rate within 30 days of completing daptomycin was 42 of 128 (33%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide preliminary results on the use of daptomycin in critically ill patients with complicated conditions. Controlled studies are needed to best evaluate daptomycin use in these patients.
TI  - Oritavancin: mechanism of action.
AB  - Oritavancin is a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide analogue of vancomycin that contains the heptapeptide core common to all glycopeptides. It differs from vancomycin by the presence of a hydrophobic N-4-(4-chlorophenyl)benzyl (also referred to as 4'-chlorobiphenylmethyl) substituent on the disaccharide sugar, the addition of a 4-epi-vancosamine monosaccharide to the amino acid residue in ring 6, and the replacement of the vancosamine moiety by 4-epi-vancosamine. One mechanism of action of oritavancin is inhibition of transglycosylation (important in peptidoglycan synthesis) by binding to D-alanyl-D-alanine stem termini in Gram-positive bacteria. The inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis via inhibition of transglycosylation is common to all glycopeptides (vancomycin) and lipoglycopeptides. Secondary binding of oritavancin to the pentaglycyl (Asp/Asn) bridging segment in peptidoglycan also occurs, which distinguishes it from vancomycin and contributes to oritavancin's activity versus vancomycin-resistant organisms. The presence of the hydrophobic 4'-chlorobiphenylmethyl group allows for interaction and disruption of the cell membrane, resulting in depolarization, permeabilization, and concentration-dependent, rapid cell death. This mechanism is shared with telavancin but not vancomycin and results in activity against daptomycin-nonsusceptible organisms. In conclusion, oritavancin's mechanism of action involves at least 3 known mechanisms: inhibition of transglycosylation, inhibition of transpeptidation, and cell membrane interaction/disruption. Oritavancin's multiple mechanisms of action confer activity against vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant organisms, as well as rapid, concentration-dependent killing versus actively growing, stationary phase, and biofilm-producing Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass Dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  - The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. In the present study, 47 LAB strains were isolated from farmed seabass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16S rDNA and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA - polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). Their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecium (59%), Enterococcus faecalis (21%), Enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), Enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), Enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and Lactococcus lactis (1 strain). An Aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. The survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. Different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. More than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum, and Carnobacterium sp. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.
TI  - Action of linezolid or vancomycin on biofilms in ventriculoperitoneal shunts in vitro.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts used to treat hydrocephalus have an overall infection rate of about 10% of operations. The commonest causative bacteria are Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. Major difficulties are encountered with nonsurgical treatment due to biofilm development in the shunt tubing and inability to achieve sufficiently high CSF drug levels by intravenous administration. Recently, three cases of S. epidermidis CSF shunt infection have been treated by intravenous linezolid without surgical shunt removal, and we therefore investigated vancomycin and linezolid against biofilms of these bacteria in vitro. A continuous-perfusion model of shunt catheter biofilms was used to establish mature (1-week) biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (both methicillin resistant [MRSA and MRSE]), Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. They were then "treated" with either vancomycin or linezolid in concentrations achievable in CSF for 14 days. The biofilms were then monitored for 1 week for eradication and for regrowth. Enterococcal biofilms were not eradicated by either vancomycin or linezolid. Staphylococcal biofilms were eradicated by both antibiotics after 2 days and did not regrow. No resistance was seen. Linezolid at concentrations achievable by intravenous or oral administration was able to eradicate biofilms of both S. epidermidis (MRSE) and S. aureus (MRSA). Neither vancomycin at concentrations achievable by intrathecal administration nor linezolid was able to eradicate enterococcal biofilms. It is hoped that these in vitro results will stimulate further clinical trials with linezolid, avoiding surgical shunt removal.
TI  - [Antibiotic treatment of enterococcal infections in gastroenterology with daptomycin - first experiences from the EU-CORE registry study (European Cubicin(R) Outcomes Registry and Experience)].
AB  - Enterococci are a frequent cause of nosocomial infections in gastroenterology. The increase of Enterococcus faecium infections with development of resistance to gentamicin and vancomycin as well as possible linezolid resistance require alternative antibiotic therapies. Study data show that daptomycin, a highly bactericidal antibiotic is effective in enterococcal infections. However, in Germany daptomycin is so far only approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. In the Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Halle (Saale) from May 2 009 to April 2 010 all gastroenterological patients with evidence of invasive enterococcal infection received intravenous daptomycin treatment at inclusion in the European Cubicin(R) Outcomes Registry and Experience (EU-CORE). Gastroenterological diseases treated were necrotising pancreatitis, infected pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses, obstructive cholangitis and sepsis. The clinical outcome was retrospectively detected by protocol-defined criteria. A total of 13 patients (8 male, 5 female, median age 59 years) with microbiologically assured enterococcal infections (10 x E. faecium, including 1 x VRE, 6 x E. faecalis, including double infections) were treated with intravenous daptomycin (6 mg per kg body weight). In the presence of polymicrobial infections (10 of 13 patients), an additional anti-infective therapy was initiated according to sensitivity testing. Concomitantly a direct focus approach with stenting, puncture or drainage was performed. The clinical cure rate was 92 % (12 of 13 patients). One patient died from a non-surgically uncontrollable malignancy (Klatskin tumour Bismuth IIIb). There were no adverse events. These results allow us to conclude that antibiotic therapy with daptomycin in invasive or bacteraemic enterococcal infections leads to high cure rates (up to 90 % and more) when concomitant and adequate focus relief is performed. Larger clinical studies to obtain an extended drug approval are desirable.
TI  - Minim typing--a rapid and low cost MLST based typing tool for Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based genotyping method for Klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci. The approach is termed mini-MLST or Minim typing and it has previously been applied to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Six SNPs were derived from concatenated MLST sequences on the basis of maximisation of the Simpsons Index of Diversity (D). DNA fragments incorporating these SNPs and predicted to be suitable for HRM analysis were designed. Using the assumption that HRM alleles are defined by G+C content, Minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a D = 0.979 against known STs. The method was tested against 202 K. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the MLST analyses were performed after the HRM analyses. The HRM-based alleles were indeed in accordance with G+C content, and the Minim typing identified known STs and flagged new STs. The tonB MLST locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two Minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. However these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. Therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonB gene (D = 0.929), and the other using HRM data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonB MLST fragment (D = 0.995). The HRM assays were developed on the Rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the LightCycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. The assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current MLST data. Minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by ESKAPE organisms: cause, clinical features, and management.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite important geographical variations, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episodes. Their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on ICU patients' outcome. This review updates information on VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. Local colonization determines treatment options. The contribution of tracheobronchitis is an important issue. Minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria VAP to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. Strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by ESKAPE pathogens. SUMMARY: VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.
TI  - [Trends of bacterial resistance phenotypes in high-complexity public and private  hospitals in Colombia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe and compare the frequency of bacterial resistance phenotypes  of microorganisms obtained from patients in intensive care units (ICU) and other (non-ICU) high-complexity public and private hospital services in Colombia. METHODS: A retrospective observational, analytical, multicenter study was conducted. The records from January 2007 to December 2009 on bacterial isolates and bacterial resistance phenotypes of microorganisms obtained from ICU and non-ICU patients in 79 high-complexity public and private hospitals were consolidated. The information was analyzed with the WHONET((R)) 5.5 (WHO) software, following the 2009 recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and summarized on an Excel((R)) spreadsheet. A descriptive analysis with the calculation of proportions was performed. The trends were analyzed with Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: The 2007-2009 trends for bacterial resistance phenotypes show increased percentages of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin-resistant K. pneumoniae, ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae (r = 1, P < 0.01), and reduced percentages of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (r = -1, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The trend analysis presented in this study is the baseline for establishing a national epidemiological surveillance subsystem. The trends observed reveal that bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs in hospitals in Colombia is a dynamic phenomenon, with evidence of the emergence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae phenotypes in the hospitals.
TI  - A simple method for primary screening of antibacterial peptides in plant seeds.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Regarding the importance of finding new antibacterial  drugs, screening of plants as a promising resource are now conducted worldwide. In this study, we report the application of a simple previously described method for screening of different plant seeds in order to find the best resources of plant antimicrobial peptides. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total water soluble protein of 10 different plant seeds were extracted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent agar-overlay bioassays. Standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Escherichia coli were included in the bioassays. This method also was used for total proteins precipitated by Ammonium sulphate which ensure the protein nature of the test substances. Molecular size and the amounts of effective peptides were estimated using Tricin-SDS-PAGE and densitometry. RESULTS: Two different plant seeds showed noticeable antibacterial activities against tested Gram positive bacteria and a moderate inhibitory effect on Gram negative ones. Based on the results of Tricin-SDS-PAGE analysis which were carried out in parallel to bioassays, it was concluded that effective antibacterial substances are peptides with molecular weight of slightly larger than 5 kDa. CONCLUSION: On the basis of results of agar-overlay experiments and by screening of 10 different herbal seeds, we could introduce seeds of M. sativa L. and Onobrychis sativa Lam., as great sources of putative plant antibacterial peptides. The proposed screening method can be used for screening of large number of different plant seeds and even other parts of the plant body, regarding some necessary modification in total water soluble protein extraction steps.
TI  - Mechanism of Honey Bacteriostatic Action Against MRSA and VRE Involves Hydroxyl Radicals Generated from Honey's Hydrogen Peroxide.
AB  - It has been recently reported that honey hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with unknown honey components produced cytotoxic effects resulting in bacterial growth inhibition and DNA degradation. The objective of this study was twofold: (a) to investigate whether the coupling chemistry involving hydrogen peroxide is responsible for a generation of hydroxyl radicals and (b) whether (*)OH generation affects growth of multi-drug resistant clinical isolates. The susceptibility of five different strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and four strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) isolates from infected wounds to several honeys was evaluated using broth microdilution assay. Isolates were identified to genus and species and their susceptibility to antibiotics was confirmed using an automated system (Vitek((R)), Biomerieux((R))). The presence of the mec(A) gene, nuc gene and van(A) and (B) genes were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that no clinical isolate was resistant to selected active honeys. The median difference in honeys MICs against these strains ranged between 12.5 and 6.25% v/v and was not different from the MIC against standard Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Generation of (*)OH during bacteria incubation with honeys was analyzed using 3'-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein (APF) as the (*)OH trap. The (*)OH participation in growth inhibition was monitored directly by including APF in broth microdilution assay. The growth of MRSA and VRE was inhibited by (*)OH generation in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure of MRSA and VRE to honeys supplemented with Cu(II) augmented production of (*)OH by 30-fold and increased honey bacteriostatic potency from MIC(90) 6.25 to MIC(90)< 0.78% v/v. Pretreatment of honeys with catalase prior to their supplementation with Cu ions fully restored bacterial growth indicating that hydroxyl radicals were produced from H(2)O(2) via the Fenton-type reaction. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that bacteriostatic effect of honeys on MRSA and VRE was dose-dependently related to generation of (*)OH from honey H(2)O(2).
TI  - Reversal of antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive bacteria by the antihistaminic azelastine.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance represents a serious problem that complicates microbial infection. The use of 'helper compounds' capable of enhancing the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics is being investigated. Azelastine, a new generation antihistaminic, possesses certain antibacterial activity and is capable of inducing alteration in the bacterial membrane permeability. Hence, we hypothesized that it could reverse resistance to antibiotics. Azelastine significantly increased the antibacterial activity of eight antibiotics belonging to five different classes (beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and tetracyclines) against nine Gram-positive clinical isolates: five Staphylococcus aureus, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and two Enterococcus faecium, seven of which were multi-drug resistant, reversing their resistance to the tested antibiotics. The synergistic effects of azelastine with the studied antibiotics increased with raising the pH from 5 to 8. Antibiotics did not affect the ability of azelastine to alter the permeability of a liposomal artificial membrane model, an effect thought to be critical for the interaction with antibiotics. The findings of this study present azelastine as a potential 'helper compound' that could reverse the resistance of multi-drug resistant Gram-positive clinical isolates to antibiotics.
TI  - [Microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  - AIM: Development of methodical approach of evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in human intestine microsymbiocenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 9 bifidobacteria cultures (dominants) and 18 opportunistic microorganism strains (associants) isolated from patients during examination for intestine dysbiosis and identified by conventional methods were used. Evaluation of microbial "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis was performed by author developed technique that is based on determination of growth factors (GF), anti-lysozyme activity (ALA) and formation of biofilms (BFF) of associants co-incubated with exometabolites of dominants. GF, ALA, BFF were studied photometrically (Bukharin O.V., 1999, 2009; O'Toole G.A., 2000). The data were statistically analyzed by Fisher-Student criteria. RESULTS: The detected opposite (increase/reduction) phenomenon of the "dominant-associant" pair allowed realization of the "friend-foe" identification in microsymbiocenosis. Associants (E. coli and Enterococcus faecium) were "friend" species, in which bifidobacteria exometabolites did not change growth properties and stimulated ALA (by 17,5--32%) and BFF (by 25 - 39%). Associants (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans) were "foe" microsymbiont species, in which bifidoflora exometabolites decreased GF (by 20,7--68%), ALA (by 22,7--54%) and BFF (by 22,5 --39%). CONCLUSION: Indigenous microflora during microsymbiocenosis formation can participate in "friend-foe" identification, the basis of which is determined by microsymbiont exometabolites. The data obtained open a perspective of understanding mechanisms of intramicrobial interactions and can be used for both diagnostics and optimal selection of "candidates" during creation of new probiotics and synbiotics.
TI  - Novel vancomycin-resistance transposon, plasmid replicon types, and virulence factors of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci in Zhejiang, China.
AB  - Forty-seven vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains were isolated from clinical samples in 13 Zhejiang hospitals and fecal samples from ICU patients in a large teaching hospital in China. No VRE isolates were detected in healthy human subjects. CC17 was the main clonal complex in clinical Enterococcus faecium isolates but not in isolates from healthy human subjects. Novel vancomycin-resistance transposons were detected among VRE strains. This is the first report demonstrating insertion of tnpA and fosB genes in the vanRS-vanH intergenic region of Tn1546 leading to coresistance to vancomycin and fosfomycin. The four plasmid replicon types (pRUM, pRE25, pEF418, and pB82) were more common in VRE isolates, suggesting their association with vancomycin resistance and nosocomial transmission. The prevalence rate of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-related Inc18-like plasmid, pIP501, in VRE was 21.3%. The prevalence of the esp gene among VRE isolates was high (76.6%). In several VRE strains, the esp and hyl genes were cotransferred with the vanA gene by conjugation. Although the frequency of VRE is low in Chinese hospitals, its association with virulence determinants, the vancomycin-resistance transposon with other resistance gene insertions or plasmids may lead to multidrug resistance and the evolution of pathogenic VRE.
TI  - An N-halamine-based rechargeable antimicrobial and biofilm controlling polyurethane.
AB  - An N-halamine precursor, 5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMH), was covalently linked to the surface of polyurethane (PU) with 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as the coupling agent. The reaction pathways were investigated using propyl isocyanate (PI) as a model compound. The results suggested that the imide and amide groups of DMH have very similar reactivities toward the isocyanate groups on PU surfaces activated with HDI. After bleach treatment the covalently bound DMH moieties were transformed into N-halamines. The new N-halamine-based PU provided potent antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium), Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacterium), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, drug-resistant Gram-positive bacterium), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE, drug-resistant Gram-positive bacterium), and Candida albicans (fungus), and successfully prevented bacterial and fungal biofilm formation. The antimicrobial and biofilm controlling effects were stable for longer than 6 months under normal storage in open air. Furthermore, if the functions were lost due to prolonged use they could be recharged by another chlorination treatment. The recharging could be repeated as needed to achieve long-term protection against microbial contamination and biofilm formation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the investigational pleuromutilin compound BC-3781 tested against Gram-positive organisms commonly associated with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - BC-3781 is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent developed as an intravenous and oral therapy for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and respiratory tract infections (RTI). BC-3781 and comparator agents were tested by the broth microdilution method against 1,893 clinical Gram-positive organisms predominantly causing ABSSSI. BC-3781 exhibited potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mug/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.5 mug/ml), and Enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin-nonsusceptible strains) (MIC(50/90), 0.12/2 mug/ml). Compared with other antibiotics in use for the treatment of ABSSSI, BC-3781 displayed the lowest MICs and only a minimal potential for cross-resistance with other antimicrobial classes.
TI  - Studies on the biosynthesis of the lipodepsipeptide antibiotic Ramoplanin A2.
AB  - Ramoplanin, a non-ribosomally synthesized peptide antibiotic, is highly effective against several drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), two important opportunistic human pathogens. Recently, the biosynthetic cluster from the ramoplanin producer Actinoplanes ATCC 33076 was sequenced, revealing an unusual architecture of fatty acid and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic genes (NRPSs). The first steps towards understanding how these biosynthetic enzymes cooperatively interact to produce the depsipeptide product are expression and isolation of each enzyme to probe its specificity and function. Here we describe the successful production of soluble enzymes from within the ramoplanin locus and the confirmation of their specific role in biosynthesis. These methods may be broadly applicable to the production of biosynthetic enzymes from other natural product biosynthetic gene clusters, especially those that have been refractory to production in heterologous hosts despite standard expression optimization methods.
TI  - Colicin M hydrolyses branched lipids II from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Lipids II found in some Gram-positive bacteria were prepared in radioactive form  from l-lysine-containing UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The specific lateral chains of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus (di-L-alanine, D-isoasparagine, and pentaglycine, respectively) were introduced by chemical peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemistry. The branched nucleotides obtained were converted into the corresponding lipids II by enzymatic synthesis using the MraY and MurG enzymes. All of the lipids were hydrolysed by Escherichia coli colicin M at approximately the same rate as the meso-diaminopimelate-containing lipid II found in Gram-negative bacteria, thereby opening the way to the use of this enzyme as a broad spectrum antibacterial agent.
TI  - Factors influencing the occurence of nosocomial bloodstream infections observed in thoracic and cardiosurgical postoperative care units.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse the epidemiology and aetiology of laboratoryconfirmed bloodstream infections (LC-BSI) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) after pulmonary and coronary surgery, in postoperative intensive care units in 2009. METHODS: Sources of infections were identified by the hospital Infection Control Team in cooperation with ITU personnel using the CDC definitions. RESULTS: A total of 37 LC-BSI and 21 CLA-BSI cases in 3.096 patients were detected. Central line device utilization ratio was 0.50. The total cumulative LC-BSI incidence rate was 1.2% and CLA-BSI rate 8.7 per 1,000 central line days. The most common causes of LC-BSI were Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus - 5.9%, CNS - 50.0%, Enterococcus faecium - 5.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We found that in those units in which surveillance of CLA-BSI had been conducted since 2002, BSI incidence rates were higher than those reported in the NHSN programme.
TI  - Trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan study, 2006 to 2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 1,141), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in Taiwan. MICs of tigecycline were determined following the criteria of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST-2011). Among drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, all of the PRSP isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (MIC(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one MRSA isolate (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three VRE isolates (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for ESBL-producing E. coli (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (MIC(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by FDA criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by EUCAST-2011 criteria. The susceptibility rate for A. baumannii (MIC(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. A bimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii isolates, and a unimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates. In Taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of A. baumannii.
TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of infections by multiresistant bacteria in cirrhosis: a prospective study.
AB  - Epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical effect of infections by multiresistant bacteria in cirrhosis are poorly known. This work was a prospective evaluation in two series of cirrhotic patients admitted with infection or developing infection during hospitalization. The first series was studied between 2005 and 2007 (507 bacterial infections in 223 patients) and the second between 2010 and 2011 (162 bacterial infections in 110 patients). In the first series, 32% of infections were community acquired (CA), 32% healthcare associated (HCA), and 36% nosocomial. Multiresistant bacteria (92 infections; 18%) were isolated in 4%, 14%, and 35% of these infections, respectively (P < 0.001). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E; n = 43) was the main multiresistant organism identified, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 17), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 14), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 14). The efficacy of currently recommended empirical antibiotic therapy was very low in nosocomial infections (40%), compared to HCA and CA episodes (73% and 83%, respectively; P < 0.0001), particularly in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia (26%, 29%, and 44%, respectively). Septic shock (26% versus 10%; P < 0.0001) and mortality rate (25% versus 12%; P = 0.001) were significantly higher in infections caused by multiresistant strains. Nosocomial origin of infection (hazard ratio [HR], 4.43), long-term norfloxacin prophylaxis (HR, 2.69), recent infection by multiresistant bacteria (HR, 2.45), and recent use of beta-lactams (HR, 2.39) were independently associated with the development of multiresistant infections. Results in the second series were similar to those observed in the first series. CONCLUSIONS: Multiresistant bacteria, especially ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, are frequently isolated in nosocomial and, to a lesser extent, HCA infections in cirrhosis, rendering third-generation cephalosporins clinically ineffective. New antibiotic strategies tailored according to the local epidemiological patterns are needed for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections in cirrhosis.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  - The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. Consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. Little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different pH values. Consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (SA) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR Vibrio sp, MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) producing Salmonella sp, ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL producing Proteus mirabilis, ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI)]. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-positive isolates at a pH of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. A mean CZOI of 5 mm was recorded for the SCMC dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the SA dressing. At a pH of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. However, at a pH of 8.5 the mean CZOI of the SCMC dressing was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the SA dressing for a select number of isolates. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the Gram-positive bacteria. Susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. Interestingly, when pH was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (P < 0.05). Overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all pH ranges. In addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when pH became more acidic. The findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role pH plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
TI  - [Systematic review of antimicrobial resistance among Gram positive cocci in hospitals in Colombia].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is a public health problem worldwide whose proper management requires knowledge of its presence and its behavior in each region and country. OBJECTIVES: A survey of the medical literature was conducted to identify levels of resistance to antibiotic markers in Gram positive bacterial isolates from Colombian hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature included articles indexed in MEDLINE and LILACS. A manual search was made of Colombian scientific journals and other infectious disease literature not available electronically. RESULTS: A total of 34 observational studies were located, including a series of consecutive reports initiated in 2001. Most of the reports came from the city of Bogota. The rate of methicillin resistance for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci in non intensive care unit isolates ranged between 35%-50% and 72%-76%, respectively. Resistance in intensive care unit isolates had a range between 35%-71% and 74%-83%, respectively. The rate of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium averaged less than 20% over the years but with large annual variation . CONCLUSIONS: Resistance markers appeared in high frequency among Gram positive isolates identified in hospitals in major Colombian cities.
TI  - Agreement assessment of tigecycline susceptibilities determined by the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods among commonly encountered resistant bacterial isolates: results from the Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, 2008 to 2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, initiated in 2006,  is a nationwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered drug-resistant bacteria. This study compared the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 3,014 isolates of clinically important drug-resistant bacteria using the standard broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 759), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE; n = 191), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 602), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 736), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 726) that had been collected from patients treated between 2008 and 2010 at 20 hospitals in Taiwan. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted according to the currently recommended U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria. The MIC(90) values of tigecycline against MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing E. coli, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii were 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. The total error rates between the two methods using the FDA criteria were high: 38.4% for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and 33.8% for A. baumannii. Using the EUCAST criteria, the total error rate was also high (54.6%) for A. baumannii isolates. The total error rates between these two methods were <5% for MRSA, VRE, and ESBL-producing E. coli. For routine susceptibility testing of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii against tigecycline, the broth microdilution method should be used because of the poor correlation of results between these two methods.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance dynamics and isolation rate of staphylococci and enterococci from patients of reconstructive surgery units].
AB  - The dynamics of isolation of staphylococci and enterococci from clinical material of patients and their antibiotic susceptibility within a 5-year period (2005-2009) was analysed. 5990 isolates were tested: 1250 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 3268 isolates of S. epidermidis, 1005 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and 467 isolates of E. faecium. Grampositive infections were shown to be prevailing within the last 2-3 years, the nosocomial epidermal staphylococci more and more replacing S. aureus (the ratio of S. epidermidis and S. aureus in 2009 was 3.3). The isolation rate of E. faecalis significantly increased (by 3.5 times) and the ratio of E. faecalis and E. faecium in 2009 was 4.3. The microflora composition with respect to the isolation source was analysed and its clinical significance was estimated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that oxacillin had its own specific niche, while antibiotics active against resistant grampositive cocci, such as rifampicin, fusidic acid, fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin), cefoxitin, as well as amoxicillin/clavulane in infections due to E. faecalis, might be considered as the drugs of choice. In the treatment of nosocomial infections, when the etiological role of MRSA or VRE is suspected or confirmed, the complex therapy should obligatory include the most active antibiotics (vancomycin or linezolid among them).
TI  - Improved antibiotic-impregnated catheters with extended-spectrum activity against resistant bacteria and fungi.
AB  - Minocycline-rifampin-impregnated central venous catheters (M/R CVCs) have been shown to be efficacious in reducing catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and inhibiting the biofilm adherence of resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. To expand the spectrum of antimicrobial activity, a novel second-generation M/R catheter was developed by adding chlorhexidine (CHX-M/R). CVCs and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) were impregnated with CHX-M/R and compared with first-generation M/R catheters, CHX-silver sulfadiazine-treated CVCs (CHX/SS-CVCs), chlorhexidine-treated PICCs, and uncoated catheters. A biofilm catheter colonization model was used to assess the efficacy of catheters against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), P. aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata. CHX-M/R-impregnated CVCs were the only antimicrobial catheters that completely inhibited the biofilm colonization of all resistant bacterial and fungal organisms tested at all time intervals, and they were significantly superior to uncoated catheters (all P values were </=0.003). Furthermore, CHX-M/R-coated CVCs had a significantly more effective and prolonged (up to 3 weeks) antimicrobial activity against MRSA and P. aeruginosa than M/R, CHX/SS, and uncoated CVCs (P < 0.0001). Similarly, CHX-M/R-coated PICCs were also superior to M/R-coated and CHX-coated PICCs in preventing biofilms of MRSA, VRE, P. aeruginosa, and Candida species (P value = 0.003 for all). Our study shows that novel CHX-M/R-coated catheters have unique properties in completely inhibiting biofilm colonization of MRSA, VRE, P. aeruginosa, and fungi in a manner superior to that of M/R- and chlorhexidine-treated catheters.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance monitoring in Lower Saxony (ARMIN): first trends for MRSA, ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and VRE from 2006 to 2010].
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most important health topics of the past few years. To identify regional trends of antimicrobial resistance in inpatient and outpatient care, the Governmental Institute of Public Health of Lower Saxony (Germany) launched the sentinel system ARMIN (Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring in Lower Saxony). Currently 9 laboratories participate as sentinel sites and contribute single case data of their microbiological results. Data are presented by an interactive data query in the internet. From 2006 to 2010 laboratories reported about 800 000 diagnostic test results. The proportion of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) among all Staphylococcus aureus increased from 19.5% in 2006 to 23.4% in 2010 for inpatient care in Lower Saxony. During the same period Escherichia coli resistance to cefotaxime for inpatient care increased from 3.0% to 8.8%. Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin decreased from 13.6% to 5.6%. Currently the emphasis of ARMIN is on the description of trends and on the information of prescribing physicians. A quality circle was established to improve standardisation.
TI  - Activity of tigecycline and comparators against skin and skin structure pathogens: global results of the Tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial, 2004-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) reports on 24 784 isolates collected from integumentary culture sources between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and susceptibility were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints applied against tigecycline). RESULTS: All methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. MIC(90)s for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium ranged between 0.12 mg/l and 0.25mg/l. Resistance to the carbapenems and tigecycline was low among the Enterobacteriaceae, with resistance at </= 2.0% between 2004 and 2009 for tigecycline against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, and Serratia marcescens, for imipenem against E. coli and Enterobacter spp, and for meropenem against E. coli, Enterobacter spp, and S. marcescens. Against the Acinetobacter baumannii collected in 2009, resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam was >30%; between 2004 and 2009 resistance to minocycline varied between 1.4% and 4.8%, and tigecycline MIC(90)s were </= 2mg/l. Against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected, MIC(90)s were greater than the susceptibility breakpoint for cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, levofloxacin, and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: The problem of antimicrobial resistance is demonstrated by the data presented. T.E.S.T. continues to provide valuable information on antimicrobial resistance globally.
TI  - Mechanistic analysis of muraymycin analogues: a guide to the design of MraY inhibitors.
AB  - The systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the muraymycins (MRYs) using an Ugi four-component reaction (U4CR) was investigated. The impact of the lipophilic substituent on antibacterial activity was significant, and the analogues 8 and 9 having a lipophilic side chain exhibited good activity against a range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including MRSA and VRE. Further investigation of compounds 8 and 9 revealed these analogues to be selective inhibitors of the MraY transferase and nontoxic to HepG2 cells. The SAR of the accessory urea-peptide moiety indicated that it could be simplified. Our SAR study of the MRYs suggests a probable mechanism for inhibition of the MraY, where the inner moiety of the urea-dipeptide motif interacts with the carbohydrate recognition domain in the cytoplasmic loop 5. The predicted binding model would provide further direction toward the design of potent MraY inhibitors. This study has set the stage for the generation of novel antibacterial "lead" compounds based on MRYs.
TI  - Telavancin activity tested against a contemporary collection of Gram-positive pathogens from USA Hospitals (2007-2009).
AB  - This study updates the activity of telavancin against Gram-positive pathogens collected from USA hospitals (2007-2009). Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 mug/mL) was active against coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (100% susceptible), for which only daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(50/90), </= 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) exhibited similar activity. Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) inhibited 96.5% of Enterococcus faecalis at the Food and Drug Administration breakpoint (MIC, </= 1 mug/mL), where ampicillin (99.9% susceptible), daptomycin (99.9% susceptible), and linezolid (100% susceptible) also demonstrated high-level coverage. Telavancin inhibited, respectively, 100.0% and 91.7% of VanB-phenotype E. faecalis and E. faecium at </= 1 mug/mL, whereas it was less active against VanA strains. Telavancin was uniformly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae and resistant subsets, and demonstrated good potency (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL) against other streptococci, regardless of resistance to other drugs. This assessment reveals potent activity of telavancin against Gram-positive isolates collected from USA hospitals with no evidence of emergence of resistance.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline and linezolid among gram-positive isolates collected in the United States as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (TEST) between 2004 and 2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was initiated in 2004 to chart the activity of tigecycline and comparator antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms globally. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide an analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive organisms collected from the 9 census regions of the United States between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: The MICs and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology. For tigecycline, US Food and Drug Administration susceptibility criteria were used. RESULTS: A total of 8782 Staphylococcus aureus isolates (54.5% methicillin-resistant S aureus) were collected, with the highest percentage of MRSA isolates collected from the South Central region (67.9%). All S aureus isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. Overall, 4.6% of Enterococcus faecalis (n = 3753) and 69.1% of Enterococcus faecium (n = 1417) isolates were vancomycin resistant, with the highest rates in the East North Central region for E faecalis (7.1%) and the South Atlantic region for E faecium (79.5%). Small numbers of linezolid nonsusceptible E faecalis (n = 13) were identified. MIC(90) values for tigecycline were </=0.25 mg/L against E faecalis and 0.12 mg/L against E faecium. Of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected (n = 4541), 1.1% were penicillin resistant. All S pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin; susceptibility to tigecycline varied between 80.9% (Pacific region) and 95.2% (West North Central region). CONCLUSIONS: The rates of MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp varied among the 9 census regions; however, susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline remained consistent, with low MIC(90) values and high rates of antimicrobial susceptibility.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial aporphine alkaloids from Fissistigma poilanei (Annonaceae) collected in Vietnam.
AB  - Two new aporphine alkaloids: 8-hydroxy-9-methoxy-1,2-methylenedioxyaporphine (1)  and 8-hydroxy-3,9-dimethoxy-1,2-methylenedioxyaporphine (2) were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of Fissistigma poilanei along with five known compounds: oxocrebanine (3), kuafumine (4), (2R,3R)-3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxydihydroflavonol-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (5), (+)-catechin 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (6) and quercetine 3,7-dimethoxy-3'-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7). These two new aporphine alkaloids exhibited a moderate cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cell lines (KB, Hep-G2, MCF-7, LU) as well as antimicrobial activity against Lactobacillus fermentum, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtillis.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance really starts to hurt.
AB  
TI  - One-pot syntheses of pseudopteroxazoles from pseudopterosins: a rapid route to non-natural congeners with improved antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Rapid one-pot methodologies to prepare pseudopteroxazole (1) and novel congeners  from abundant natural pseudopterosins have been devised. This is highlighted here with the first synthesis of the marine natural product homopseudopteroxazole (2) utilizing a novel, silver(I)-mediated catechol to benzoxazole transformation. Pseudopteroxazoles and isopseudopteroxazoles exhibit potent activity against a range of important Gram-positive pathogens including Mycobacterium spp. and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Several non-natural pseudopteroxazoles exhibited strong activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, thereby displaying a broader spectrum of antibiotic activity compared to pseudopteroxazole.
TI  - Engineered biosynthesis of glycosylated derivatives of narbomycin and evaluation  of their antibacterial activities.
AB  - A 14-membered macrolide antibiotic narbomycin produced from Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 15439 is composed of polyketide macrolactone ring and D-desosamine as a deoxysugar moiety, which acts as an important determinant of its antibacterial activity. In order to generate diverse glycosylated derivatives of narbomycin, expression plasmids carrying different deoxysugar biosynthetic gene cassettes and the gene encoding a substrate-flexible glycosyltransferase DesVII were constructed and introduced into S. venezuelae YJ003 mutant strain bearing a deletion of thymidine-5'-diphospho-D-desosamine biosynthetic gene cluster. The resulting recombinants of S. venezuelae produced a range of new analogs of narbomycin, which possess unnatural sugar moieties instead of native deoxysugar D-desosamine. The structures of narbomycin derivatives were determined through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry analyses and their antibacterial activities were evaluated in vitro against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Substitution with L-rhamnose or 3-O-demethyl-D-chalcose was demonstrated to exhibit greater antibacterial activity than narbomycin and the clinically relevant erythromycin. This work provides new insight into the functions of deoxysugar biosynthetic enzymes and structure-activity relationships of the sugar moieties attached to the macrolides and demonstrate the potential of combinatorial biosynthesis for the generation of new macrolides carrying diverse sugars with increased antibacterial activities.
TI  - [Investigation of the efficacy of some disinfectants against nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. isolates].
AB  - Nosocomial infections which exhibit an increasing trend worldwide, are important  contributors to morbidity and mortality. Most bacteria that cause nosocomial infections can retain their viability even after exposure to disinfectants in routine practice. This study was conducted to determine the susceptibilities of nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. isolates to various disinfectants. A total of 30 S.aureus [16 were methicillin-resistant (MRSA), 14 were methicillin-susceptible (MSSA)] and 21 Enterococcus spp. (13 E.faecalis, 7 E.faecium, 1 non-typable Enterococcus spp.) strains isolated from clinical samples of hospitalized patients as nosocomial infection agents in the Central Microbiology Laboratory of Ibn-i Sina Hospital, Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, were included in the study. Glutaraldehyde (2% wt/vol), chlorhexidine gluconate (4% wt/vol), 2-propanol (70% vol/vol), povidone iodine (7.5% wt/vol), povidone iodine (10% wt/vol) and hydrogen peroxide (3% wt/vol) susceptibilities of the isolates were investigated by quantitative suspension test at contact times of 3, 5, and 10 minutes. All of the isolates were found susceptible to glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) at all tested contact times. However, 12 S.aureus (5 MSSA, 7 MRSA) and 3 enterococci (2 E.faecium, 1 E.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 3 minutes contact time; 11 S.aureus (4 MSSA, 7 MRSA) and 7 E.faecalis isolates were found susceptible at 5 minutes contact time, and 6 S.aureus (4 MSSA, 2 MRSA) and 3 enterococci (1 E.faecium, 2 E.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible at 10 minutes contact time. One MSSA and 8 enterococci (4 E.faecium, 3 E.faecalis, 1 Enterococcus spp.) isolates were found resistant to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 10 minutes contact time. In conclusion, glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) can be safely used against S.aureus and Enterococcus spp. owing to their high effectiveness, however, hydrogen peroxide (3%) should not be preferred against those strains due to the presence of resistant isolates, in Ankara University Ibn-i Sina Hospital.
TI  - High-dose daptomycin for treatment of complicated gram-positive infections: a large, multicenter, retrospective study.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical response and safety of high-dose daptomycin for treatment of complicated gram-positive infections. DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, observational, case series analysis. SETTING: Five academic medical centers in four major United States cities. PATIENTS: Two hundred fifty adults, not undergoing dialysis, who received high-dose daptomycin (>/= 8 mg/kg/day) for at least 72 hours for complicated gram-positive infections between January 1, 2005, and March 1, 2010. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical and microbiologic outcomes were assessed at the end of high-dose daptomycin therapy. Safety evaluations were recorded for all patients, and when available, baseline, end-of-therapy, and highest observed serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were recorded. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) were the primary organisms isolated. The median dose of daptomycin was 8.9 mg/kg/day (interquartile range [IQR] 8.0-10.0 mg/kg/day). The median duration of daptomycin during hospitalization for MRSA and VRE infection was 10 days (IQR 5-16 days) and 13 days (IQR 6-18 days), respectively. Among the 250 patients, high-dose daptomycin was primarily used as salvage therapy after vancomycin treatment (184 patients [73.6%]). Primary infections included complicated bacteremia (119 patients [47.6%]), endocarditis (59 [23.6%]), skin or wound (70 [28.0%]), and bone or joint (67 [26.8%]). Overall, clinical response and microbiologic success were assessed in 83.6% (209/250 patients) and 80.3% (175/218 patients), respectively. Isolates from 13 patients (5.2%) developed nonsusceptibility to daptomycin, with most of these patients having extended vancomycin exposure. Three patients (1.2%) developed an adverse event attributable to high-dose daptomycin therapy, with the event considered either mild or moderate in severity. The median end-of-therapy CPK level was 39 U/L (IQR 26-67 U/L). No significant correlation was found between daptomycin dose and highest observed CPK level. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin dosages of 8 mg/kg/day or greater may be safe and effective in patients with complicated gram-positive infections. Further clinical studies are warranted.
TI  - Serotypes and antibiotic resistance in Group B streptococcus isolated from patients at the Maternity Hospital, Kuwait.
AB  - A total of 143 group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates collected from mothers at the Maternity Hospital in Kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by PCR for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetM, tetL, tetO), erythromycin (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermTR, ermM, mefA, mefE, msrA) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). All isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. Most of the isolates belonged to serotypes V (38.5 %), III (20.9 %), Ia (7.7 %) and II (11.2 %). Sixteen isolates (11.2 %) were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (MICs 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). The tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetM (94.5 %), tetO (3.9 %), tetL (1.6 %) and tetK (0.8 %). The erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermB (61.1 %), ermTR (38.9 %), ermA (5.5 %), mefA (5.5 %) and mefE (11 %). All high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. One of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. Partial DNA sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the GBS isolates could have acquired aph3 from other Gram-positive cocci. The high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.
TI  - Catecholthioether derivatives: preliminary study of in-vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.
AB  - In this research, synthesis, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of a series of catecholthioethers having benzoxazole and tetrazole moieties are described. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. The synthesized compounds were tested in vitro against three Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus (clinical isolated), Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecium (clinical isolated), and two Gram-negative bacteria including Klebsiella pneumoniae (clinical isolated) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853 and the yeast Candida albicans in comparison with control drugs. Microbiological results indicated that the synthesized compounds possessed a broad spectrum of activity against the tested microorganisms at MIC values between 4-256 mug/ml. This shows compounds having tetrazole moiety were the most active against Gram-negative strains, whereas compounds having benzoxazole moiety were more active against Gram-positive ones. Also both of them showed significant antifungal activity against Candida albicans and had lower activity than the compared control drugs (Sulfamethoxazole and Fluconazole). The antioxidant activity was assessed using two methods, including, 1,1-biphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, and reducing power assays. Some of the catecholthioether derivatives showed antioxidant activity more than Trolox and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) as reference antioxidants.

TI  - A call to arms: the imperative for antimicrobial stewardship.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health crisis. The prevalence of drug-resistant organisms, such as the emerging NAP1 strain of Clostridium difficile, now highly resistant to fluoroquinolones, Acinetobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is increasing nationwide. The sources of antimicrobial resistance are manifold, but there is a well-documented causal relationship between antimicrobial use and misuse and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. As the development of new antimicrobial agents is on the decline, the medical community, across all specialties and in conjunction with public health services, must develop and implement programs and strategies designed to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the existing antimicrobial armamentarium. Such strategies are collectively known as antimicrobial stewardship programs and have the potential to minimize the emergence of resistant pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in European hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance (2003-2009).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the European medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). A total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 European countries, Turkey and Israel. the collection included S. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [MRSA]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 6,874), Enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107). The organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cSSTI (23%). Daptomycin was very active against S. aureus and CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). Daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and S. bovis (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).In summary, daptomycin was very potent against this large collection (36,769) of Gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. Decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since EMEA approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary Gram-positive species.
TI  - Characterizing vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus strains with various mechanisms  of daptomycin resistance developed in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - Two daptomycin (DAP) regimens were evaluated in a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model, and the mutants recovered were examined for changes in phenotypic characteristics. Three Enterococcus faecium strains (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE] ATCC 51559, VRE 12311, and VRE SF 12047) were utilized in a 7-day, 1-compartment in vitro PK/PD model. The simulated dosing regimens were DAP at 6 mg/kg/day (free C(max) [fC(max)] = 7.9 mug/ml, half-life [t(1/2)] = 8 h) and DAP at 10 mg/kg/day (fC(max) = 13.17 mug/ml, t(1/2) = 8 h). Samples were plated daily on Mueller-Hinton agar containing DAP at 16 mug/ml and 50 mg/liter Ca(2+) to assess the emergence of DAP resistance. For each strain, the mutant with the highest DAP MIC was then evaluated for changes in relative surface charge, cell wall thickness, and cytoplasmic membrane depolarization induced by DAP. The initial DAP MICs were 4 mug/ml for all 3 strains. A dose-dependent response and regrowth were observed for DAP 6 mg/kg/day and DAP 10 mg/kg/day against all 3 strains. Mutants of VRE ATCC 51559 (MIC = 128 and 64 mug/ml) and VRE 12311 (MIC = 256 and 32 mug/ml) were recovered from the DAP 6 mg and DAP 10 mg regimen, respectively. For VRE SF 12047, a mutant (MIC = 64 mug/ml) was recovered from the DAP 6 mg model. All mutants displayed an increase in relative surface charge compared to those of their respective parent strains. The DAP-resistant mutants displayed a 43 to 58% increase in cell wall thickness (P < 0.0001), while DAP membrane depolarization decreased by 53 to 65% compared to that of the susceptible strains. VRE with DAP resistance displayed increased surface charge, increased cell wall thickness, and decreased depolarization induced by DAP, consistent with previous observations in Staphylococcus aureus with reduced DAP susceptibility. Further characterization of DAP-resistant VRE is warranted.
TI  - Further increases in carbapenem-, amikacin-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study 2009.
AB  - PURPOSE: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has become a serious worldwide problem. The aim of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance data generated in 2009 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Susceptibility data were collected from 24 hospitals and two commercial laboratories. In the analysis, resistance did not include intermediate susceptibility. Duplicate isolates were excluded from the analysis of hospital isolates, but not from the commercial laboratory isolates. RESULTS: Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin G-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae based on meningitis breakpoint, and ampicillin- resistant Enterococcus faecium remained highly prevalent. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium gradually increased to 29%. Ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased to 17% and 33%, respectively, and fluoroquinolone-resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased to 33%, 67% and 39%, respectively. Amikacin-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased to 48%. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa increased to 51% and 26%, respectively. Higher resistance rates were observed in intensive care unit (ICU) isolates than in non-ICU isolates among the isolates from hospitals. Resistance rates were higher in hospital isolates than in clinic isolates among the isolates from commercial laboratories. CONCLUSION: Among the hospital isolates, ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone- resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., and P. aeruginosa further increased. The increase in imipenem resistance was slight in P. aeruginosa, but drastic in Acinetobacter spp. The problematic antimicrobial-organism combinations were much more prevalent among ICU isolates.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two essential oils.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of essential oils in vitro for possible application to reduce the content of microorganisms in the air of animal houses. The essential oils of Cymbopogon citrarus L. and Malaleuca alternifolia L. were screened against bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and yeast Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration of the active essential oils was tested using broth dilution assay. The essential oils concentrations ranged from 0.1-50.0%. The combined effects of essential oils were tested for Malaleuca alternifolia L. and Cymbopogon citrarus L. concentrations ranged from 0.005-50.0%. The oils showed a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity. Concentrations of 0.1-0.5% of Cymbopogon citrarus L. and Malaleuca alternifolia L. reduced total microorganisms count of Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. High antibacterial activity was also revealed for Cymbopogon citrarus L. with bactericidal concentrations of 0.8% for Escherichia coli, 5.0% for Enterococcus faecium, 5.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 8.0% for Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations of Malaleuca alternifolia L. were 5.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium, and 8.0% for Staphylococcus aureus. The essential oils of Cymbopogon citrarus and Malaleuca alternifolia may be a promising alternative of air disinfection in animal houses.
TI  - High-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. We constructed a novel vector based on the E. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pAT28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. The plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the CAMP-factor gene (cfb) promoter of Streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pBSU101. Upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by FACS-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. To assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. We successfully labeled Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the EGFP reporter plasmid pBSU101. In all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level EGFP expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.
TI  - First detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK and the dfrK-carrying transposon Tn559 in enterococci.
AB  - The trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK has been recently described in Staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. A total of 166 enterococci of different species (E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. hirae, E. durans, E. gallinarum, and E. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrK gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. The dfrK gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/L or </=1 mg/L, respectively). The tet(L)-dfrK linkage was detected in 21% of dfrK-positive enterococci. The chromosomal location of the dfrK gene was identified in one E. faecium isolate in which the dfrK was not linked to tet(L) gene but was part of a Tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radC gene. This Tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. All combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrK, dfrG, dfrF, dfrK+dfrG, dfrK+dfrF, dfrF+dfrG, and dfrF+dfrG+dfrK). The gene dfrK gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. This study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrG.
TI  - Increase of patients co-colonised or co-infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of patients co-colonised or co-infected with  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in four German tertiary care hospitals. METHODS: This study was conducted at four tertiary care hospitals (all with >1,000 beds) in different geographic regions in Germany (Berlin in the east, Luebeck in the north, Freiburg in the southwest and Nuernberg in the southeast). Routine surveillance data on MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and ESBL-producing bacteria were analysed from 2007 to 2009. Co-colonisation or co-infection was defined as a patient having positive cultures for at least two of the following resistant pathogens: MRSA, VRE faecium or different species of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae within one calendar year. RESULTS: A total of 896,822 patients were analysed, of which 10,066 patients harboured MRSA, VRE faecium and/or ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and 542 patients co-harboured at least two of those resistant pathogens. In 2009, 7.6% of the MRSA patients, 13.7% of the VRE faecium patients and even 16.1% of the ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae patients were co-colonised or co-infected. The incidence of patients with co-infection or co-colonisation increased steadily from 5 (2007) to 7 per 10,000 patients (2009). CONCLUSIONS: Patients harbouring ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae or VRE faecium had a higher risk of being co-colonised or co-infected compared to what was to be extrapolated from their overall incidence. This might be linked to their gastrointestinal reservoir and impracticality to decolonise the gut of resistant VRE and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included 3 common species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria for Enterobacteriaceae. Tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by CLSI or EUCAST. Escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. A. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of MIC breakpoint. New tentative zone diameter criteria for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. aureus, and E. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by CLSI and EUCAST.
TI  - Effect of antibiotic diversity on ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by ESKAPE Organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to test in the clinic whether antimicrobial diversity affects resistance of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: Three different strategies of empirical antimicrobial prescription for VAP were consecutively implemented in an ICU: patient specific (10 months); scheduling, including sequential quarterly prioritization (12 months) and restriction (12 months) of antimicrobials; and mixing (10 months). Periods were compared, measuring the antimicrobial heterogeneity index (AHI). Incidence and resistance patterns of VAP caused by ESKAPE were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 127 microbiologic VAP episodes were documented. ESKAPE VAP increased significantly during scheduling (AHI, 0.65) compared with patient-specific (AHI, 0.88) and mixing (AHI, 0.87) periods (relative risk, 2.67 and 3.84, respectively). This finding was associated with a significant (P < .05) increase of carbapenem-resistant A baumannii during the scheduling period (15.0%) compared with the patient-specific (2.4%) and mixing (0%) periods. ICU mortality of resistant patients with ESKAPE VAP was doubled that of patients without ESKAPE VAP (relative risk, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.67-9.48). Thirty-day mechanical ventilation-free days was significantly increased (5 days) in patients with resistant ESKAPE VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic strategies promoting diversity may prevent the emergence of resistance of ESKAPE organisms, improving use of health-care resources.
TI  - Population biology of Gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and S. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. Population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force of genetic diversity in E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. Although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of S. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. In this review, we discuss the population genetics of E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.
TI  - Tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. It is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant Clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). Conjugative transposons of the Tn916/Tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. The ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.
TI  - Synthetic 3-arylideneflavanones as inhibitors of the initial stages of biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of twenty two synthetic flavonoids is reported. Among  them three 3-arylideneflavanones, 2b, 2c, and 2i, were shown to be highly active against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis reference strains, with MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values ranging from 4.68 microg/ml (14.3 microM) to 37.5 microg/ml (119.7 microM). The synergy of oxacillin and vancomycin with 2c, evaluated as fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was shown (against planktonic culture of S. aureus A3 and E. faecium 138/09 clinical strains). The presence of 2c in the culture medium diminished the initial adhesion of bacteria to an abiotic surface. Such an effect resulted in a decrease in biofilm formation during prolonged culture. Unfortunately, 2e failed to eradicate the S. aureus mature biofilm which was already preformed, however, decreased the number of live biofilm cells. The biofilm of E. faecalis was more susceptible to the action of 3-arylideneflavanone 2c than the S. aureus biofilm. The finding that 3-arylideneflavanones are lipophilic, cause bacterial aggregation, and influence the integrity of membranes making them permeable to SYTO 9/propidium iodide dyes may implicate the cytoplasmic membrane as a target site for these compounds activity.
TI  - New noncovalent inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins from penicillin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are well known and validated targets for antibacterial therapy. The most important clinically used inhibitors of PBPs beta-lactams inhibit transpeptidase activity of PBPs by forming a covalent penicilloyl-enzyme complex that blocks the normal transpeptidation reaction; this finally results in bacterial death. In some resistant bacteria the resistance is acquired by active-site distortion of PBPs, which lowers their acylation efficiency for beta-lactams. To address this problem we focused our attention to discovery of novel noncovalent inhibitors of PBPs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our in-house bank of compounds was screened for inhibition of three PBPs from resistant bacteria: PBP2a from Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), PBP2x from Streptococcus pneumoniae strain 5204, and PBP5fm from Enterococcus faecium strain D63r. Initial hit inhibitor obtained by screening was then used as a starting point for computational similarity searching for structurally related compounds and several new noncovalent inhibitors were discovered. Two compounds had promising inhibitory activities of both PBP2a and PBP2x 5204, and good in-vitro antibacterial activities against a panel of Gram-positive bacterial strains. CONCLUSIONS: We found new noncovalent inhibitors of PBPs which represent important starting points for development of more potent inhibitors of PBPs that can target penicillin-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Eight-year (2002-2009) summary of the linezolid (Zyvox(R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum; ZAAPS) program in European countries.
AB  - The linezolid surveillance network (ZAAPS program) has been monitoring linezolid  activity and susceptibility rates for eight years (2002-2009) in european medical centers. Samples from 12-24 sites annually in 11 countries were monitored by a central laboratory design using reference MIC methods with international and regional interpretations (EUCAST). A total of 13,404 gram-positive pathogens were tested from 6 pathogen groups. Linezolid remained without documented resistance from 2002 through 2005, but beginning in 2006 resistant strains emerged at very low rates among Staphylococcus aureus (G2576T mutant in ireland, 2007), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; usually Staphylococcus epidermidis, France and Italy in 2006-2009) and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium in Germany [2006, 2008, 2009] and E. faecalis in Sweden [2008], United Kingdom [2008] and Germany [2009]); all but one strain having a target mutation. A mobile cfr was detected in an italian CoNS strain (2008 and 2009), and clonal spread was noted for linezolid-resistant strains (PFGE results). Overall the linezolid susceptibility rates were >99.9, 99.7 and 99.6% for S. aureus, CoNS and enterococci, respectively; and all streptococcal strains were susceptible (MIC(90), 1 mg/l). In conclusion, the ZAAPS program surveillance confirmed high, sustained levels of linezolid activity from 2002-2009 and without evidence of MIC creep or escalating resistance in gram-positive pathogens across monitored european nations.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from systemic infections and reported for evaluation  and antibiotic resistance surveillance by the "Dr. Victor Babes" Clinical Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Bucharest].
AB  - AIM: Testing antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains (compulsor, reported for  EARSS surveillance) isolated from patients hospitalised for systemic infection in the "Dr. V. Babe" Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases during 01.01.2005-11.11.2009, for a dynamic evaluation and for the surveillance of resistance emergence for certain classes of antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial isolation: BacT/ALERT system; strain identification in classic and automated system (ATB Expression. VITEK 2C): antibioresistance: disk-difussion method (NCCLS 2005--CLSI 2009), MIC (E-Test, ATB/ Expression, VITEK 2C). Screening of ESBL-producing strains performed with double disk-difussion method (DDD). Reference strains used: S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, E. coli A TCC 25922, Enterococcus fiecalis ATCC 29212. RESULTS: During the studied period, 245 bacterial strains have been isolated, identified and tested (Staphylococcus aureus / 70, Streptococcus pneumoniae / 61, Enterococcus faecalis / 18, Enterococcus faecium / 5, Neisseria meningitidis / 18, E. coli / 73). out of 166 hemocultures and 79 cerebrospinal fluids / CSF. The average incidence of MRSA strains in systemic infections was 34.28%. 44.28% of the S. aureus strains were resistant to erythromycin, 17.14% to cyprofloxacyne, 15.71% to rifampicine, 14.49% to gentamycine. No strain resistant to vancomycine and linezolide. Streptococcus pneumoniae presented an average high resistance to penicillin G of 11.47%. and a 1.63% resistance to third generation cephalosporines. 0% resistance to vancomycine and rifampicine. 7/ 18 Enterococcus faecalis strains and 4/5 Enterococcus faecium strains presented high level resistance to gentamycine (CN 120 microg/disk) and no strain was resistant to vancomycine, teicoplanin or linezolid. The 18 Neisseria meningitidis strains were all sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones and cloramphenicol. For the 73 Escherichia coli strains, the average incidence of ESBL-producing isolates was 10.95%, the average resistance to ampicillin was 58.90%, to gentamycine--13.88% and to cyprofloxacin--20.83%. No strain resistant to carbapenemes and amikacine. CONCLUSIONS: For the systematic surveillance of antibiotic resistance there is a need for a harmonised protocol of data gathering and strain selection and the rigurous implementation of correct evaluating methods for antibiotic resistance in the microbiology laboratory. Carbapenemes. glycopeptides and oxazolidinones still present a major effectiveness in the first intention treatment of systemic infections.
TI  - [Trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in Romania. Experience of participation in EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System), 2002-2008].
AB  - EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and CSF), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecium/faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae. Romania reported data to EARSS since 2002 so far. Though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for EARSS. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. This issue is related to the particular position of Romania in the European context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. Our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. During the 2002-2008 interval, Romania reported to EARSS a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 S aureus, 369 E. coli, 128 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 Enterococcus spp.. 71 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the EARSS protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. It is difficult to describe trends, specially in Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is a real problem in Romanian hospitals, like in other Central, Southern and South Eastern European countries: more than 25% of S. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of Enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic resistance evaluation of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for 1044 strains: 610 Staphylococcus aureus (352 from patients, 258 from carriers), 203 Streptococcus pneumoniae (53 from patients, 150 from carriers), 144 Enterococcus faecalis. 57 Enterococcus faecium and 30 Streptococcus spp. using automatic systems Vitek 2 Compact. MicroScan, disc diffusion method and Etest according to 2008 CLSI. A number of 497 Streptococcus pyogenes strains were tested for eritromycin resistance. RESULTS: There were 33.2% MRSA for strains isolated from patients and 30.0% from carriers. From MRSA strains. 35.5% were resistant to gentamicin. 33.6% to ciprofloxacin, 74.3% to erythromycin and 30.5% to rifampin. There were no S. aureus strain resistant to vancomycin and linezolid. S. aureus strains isolated from wounds were more resistant to erythromycin (43.9%) than the strains isolated from systemic infections (12.1%). From 11 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from meningitis, 4 were resistant to penicillin. Neither S. pneumoniae strain isolated from other infections, nor those from carriers had MIC to penicillin more than 4 microg/ml. S. pneumoniae strains isolated from carriers were more resistant to erythromycin. clindamycin and tetracycline than the strains isolated from patients (66.7%, 54.1%, 54.2% vs. 27.4%, 22.6%, 33.9%). E. faecium was 95.9% resistant to penicillin, 90.2% to ampicillin, 64.7% to gentamicin, 72.0% to streptomycin and 78.4% to ciprofloxacin. F. faecalis was less resistant than E. faecium at most of the antibiotics: 32.4% to gentamicin, 59.6% to streptomycin, 28.5% to ciprofloxacin. Viridans group Streptococci, all isolated from blood culture were 92% susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. To erythromycin, 12% of viridians group Streptococci were resistant. S. pyogenes resistance to eritromycin was 5.8%. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus strains showed a relatively high level of resistance to oxacillin (33.2%) and resistance in the same time to several antibiotics. S. pneumoniae can not be considered resistant to penicillin administrated parenteral, with exception of the strains isolated from meningitis. E. faecium had a higher resistance rate than E. faecalis.
TI  - In vitro activity of new antimicrobial agents against glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates from France between 2006 and 2008.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro activity of six new antimicrobial agents against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) strains from France. METHODS: Sixty epidemiologically unrelated clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium (vanA or vanB), received at the National Reference Centre for Enterococci (CNR-Enc) between 2006 and 2008, were studied. The MICs of the following antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution according to Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Microbiology (CA-SFM) guidelines: quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), linezolid (LZD), daptomycin (DPT), tigecycline (TGC), ceftobiprole (CFT), and telavancin (TLV). Strains were classified using clinical breakpoints recommended by the CA-SFM (Q-D, LZD, TGC), or the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (DPT). RESULTS: All strains were susceptible to LZD and DPT (MIC(90), 4 and 2mug/ml, respectively) and only a single strain presented intermediate susceptibility to tigecycline (MIC(90), 0.25mug/ml). Thirty percent of strains were resistant to Q-D (MIC(90), 4mug/ml), and CFT was constantly inactive (MIC(90), 64mug/ml). Finally, TLV showed low-level MICs (MIC(90), 0.5mug/ml) against vanB-positive isolates but not against vanA-positive isolates (MIC(90), 8mug/ml). CONCLUSION: Although several antibiotics are still active against GRE, it is essential to maintain an active antimicrobial resistance surveillance for these microorganisms considered as a model of multidrug resistance with a potential to transfer resistance to other bacterial species (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of daptomycin and comparator agents tested against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci: trend analysis of a 6-year period in US medical centers (2005-2010).
AB  - We evaluated daptomycin activity trends against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; MIC, >/=8 mug/mL) in a 6-year period (2005-2010) following US regulatory release for clinical use. Consecutive, unique patient strains of clinical significance were collected in 32 US medical centers and susceptibility tested in a central laboratory against daptomycin and various comparator agents by reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 22 858 S. aureus (12 181 [53.3%] MRSA), 4312 Enterococcus faecalis (195 [4.5%] VRE), and 2462 Enterococcus faecium (1867 [75.8%] VRE) were evaluated. Daptomycin susceptibility rates were 99.94%, 99.98%, and 99.68% for S. aureus, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, respectively. Among MRSA (daptomycin MIC(5)(0)/(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL), only 13 (0.11%) daptomycin-non-susceptible (MIC, >/= 2 mug/mL) isolates were observed with no MIC creep over the study interval. Daptomycin was very active against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (MIC(5)(0)/(9)(0), 1/2 mug/mL) and E. faecium (MIC(5)(0)/(9)(0), 2/2 mug/mL). Among VRE, only 4 daptomycin-non-susceptible isolates (all E. faecium) were detected. In conclusion, daptomycin demonstrated sustained activity against an extensive collection of clinical isolates of MRSA and VRE from numerous US medical centers over the last 6 monitored years.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Proteus vulgaris and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHOD: In total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the US and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA). RESULTS: The sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. For example, all Acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at pH 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at pH 5.5. The silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of Enterobacter and Escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at pH 5.5. For Enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at pH 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at pH 5.5. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. The average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at pH 7, compared with 8mm at pH 5.5. For MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at pH 7. When the pH was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the US. It also highlights the possible importance of pH and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. However, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: SLP is employed by Advanced Medical Solutions Ltd.
TI  - Global in vitro activity of tigecycline and linezolid against Gram-positive organisms collected between 2004 and 2009.
AB  - This study reports the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline and comparator antimicrobials, including linezolid, against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium collected as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) between 2004 and 2009. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using broth microdilution methodology according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined according to CLSI criteria. For tigecycline, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved criteria were used. Overall, 41.3% (8249/19 982) of S. aureus collected were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). All MRSA were susceptible to linezolid and 99.98% were susceptible to tigecycline. A total of 2.3% of E. faecalis (201/8576) and 39.7% of E. faecium (1226/3088) were vancomycin-resistant. Linezolid and tigecycline MIC(90) values (MIC at which 90% of isolates inhibited) against the Enterococcus spp. were 2mg/L and </= 0.25 mg/L, respectively. All S. pneumoniae [including 6.2% (599/9618) penicillin-non-susceptible] were susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin; tigecycline MIC(90) values were </= 0.12 mg/L. This report demonstrates the continuing good activity of tigecycline and linezolid against Gram-positive isolates globally, including resistant organisms such as MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, with antimicrobial activity maintained over the 6 years of isolate collection.
TI  - Identification of a tetraene-containing product of the indanomycin biosynthetic pathway.
AB  - The indanomycin biosynthetic gene (idm) cluster was recently identified from Streptomyces antibioticus NRRL 8167. The disruption of one of these genes, idmH, and the increased production of a previously unreported metabolite in this mutant is reported. The structure of this compound was elucidated and was shown to possess a linear tetraene. This metabolite is not a logical biosynthetic intermediate of indanomycin but instead is likely an alternate product of the pathway.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  - Wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. It is therefore imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at West Virginia University Hospital. Standardised corrected zones of inhibition (CZOIs) were performed on all clinical isolates. It was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. In particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of Candida albicans and yeasts with CZOI of 3-11.5 mm. All meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a CZOI range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. Sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. CZOIs of 4.25 mm were calculated for Enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. The bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and Candida albicans. No antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by Kirby Bauer Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute classification system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. When a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. Overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. This finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. Consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.
TI  - Trafficking of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and co-colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the trafficking of methicillin-resistant staphylococci between the hospital and community as well as the occurrence of co-colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to April 2006, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCoNS)-positive patients at the Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain were assessed for VRE co-colonization. Characterization of vancomycin resistance genotype by PCR was carried out. Close family contacts were screened for MRSA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of MRSA isolates from patient-family member pairs was conducted. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-two patients (93 MRSA; 89 MRCoNS) and 356 family members were enrolled. Seven MRSA and 41 MRCoNS strains were isolated from the family members. PFGE analysis revealed the presence of variants of a single MRSA clone among patients and their relatives. A total of 112 patients (62 MRSA; 50 MRCoNS) provided stool for VRE screening. Of these 13 stool specimens (11.6%) were VRE-positive. All the VRE isolates were from MRSA-positive patients, thus positivity rate among MRSA patients was 20.9% (n/N = 13/62). These were predominantly Enterococcus gallinarum with vanC1 genotype and one strain was Enterococcus faecium (vanB genotype). Two E. gallinarum isolates harbored an additional vanB gene. The majority of VRE isolates were from patients in medical and surgical units (n/N = 10/13; 77%). Male gender, prolonged hospitalization and presence of co-morbidities were significantly associated with MRSA/VRE co-colonization (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MRSA/VRE co-colonization with MRSA trafficking between the hospital and community environment is a public health concern occurring in our setting.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of beta-lactam antibiotic-based imidazolium- and pyridinium-type ionic liquids.
AB  - We herein report the preparation and investigation of antibacterial activity of biocidal ionic liquids (ILs) consisting of cationic imidazolium or pyridinium and an anionic beta-lactam antibiotic. The antibacterial properties were quantified by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium. In general, the ILs had improved antibacterial activity than their parent materials, whether individually or in combination. In 83% of the experiments, the ampicillin ILs (Amp-ILs) had better antibacterial activities than their quaternary halide parent materials, whereas in 92% of the experiments, Amp-ILs outperformed the commercially available sodium ampicillin salt. Amp-ILs had up to 43 times improved antibacterial activity than sodium ampicillin. Overall, when normalized for ampicillin content, ILs had greater antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. faecium than sodium ampicillin alone.
TI  - Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone antibacterial agent.
AB  - Linezolid (Zyvox) is the first member of an entirely new class of antibiotics to  reach the market in over 35 years; it was approved for use in 2000. A member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics, linezolid is highly effective for the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections and has activity that compares favorably with vancomycin for most clinically relevant pathogens. Zyvox is approved for use against serious Gram-positive infections, including those caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the very challenging methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium organisms. Zyvox inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S rRNA in the catalytic site of the 50S ribosome. It can be administered both orally and intravenously and has good tissue distribution. Recent results have demonstrated that oxazolidinone analogs related to linezolid are effective in treating pulmonary tuberculosis caused by resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in animal infection models and suggest additional new therapeutic applications for these antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - Chemical characterization and biological properties of NVC-422, a novel, stable N-chlorotaurine analog.
AB  - During oxidative burst, neutrophils selectively generate HOCl to destroy invading microbial pathogens. Excess HOCl reacts with taurine, a semi-essential amino acid, resulting in the formation of the longer-lived biogenerated broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, N-chlorotaurine (NCT). In the presence of an excess of HOCl or under moderately acidic conditions, NCT can be further chlorinated, or it can disproportionate to produce N,N-dichlorotaurine (NNDCT). In the present study, 2,2-dimethyltaurine was used to prepare a more stable N-chlorotaurine, namely, N,N-dichloro-2,2-dimethyltaurine (NVC-422). In addition, we report on the chemical characterization, in vitro antimicrobial properties, and cytotoxicity of this compound. NVC-422 was shown effectively to kill all 17 microbial strains tested, including antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. The minimum bactericidal concentration of NVC-422 against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria ranged from 0.12 to 4 mug/ml. The minimum fungicidal concentrations against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata were 32 and 16 mug/ml, respectively. NVC-422 has an in vitro cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxicity = 1,440 mug/ml) similar to that of NNDCT. Moreover, our data showed that this agent possesses rapid, pH-dependent antimicrobial activity. At pH 4, NVC-422 completely killed both Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 min at a concentration of 32 mug/ml. Finally, the effect of NVC-422 in the treatment of an E. coli-infected granulating wound rat model was evaluated. Treatment of the infected granulating wound with NVC-422 resulted in significant reduction of the bacterial tissue burden and faster wound healing compared to a saline-treated control. These findings suggest that NVC-422 could have potential application as a topical antimicrobial.
TI  - Clinical utility of daptomycin in infective endocarditis caused by Gram-positive  cocci.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria account for >80% of all cases of endocarditis. Currently,  staphylococci are the leading cause of endocarditis worldwide. Daptomycin is the drug of choice for empirical antibiotic therapy of staphylococcal endocarditis due to its optimal activity both against meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. Daptomycin has not been proven to be superior to vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA endocarditis. However, daptomycin should be considered the drug of choice for the treatment of MRSA endocarditis caused by strains with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2mug/mL, for heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) phenotypes and for glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA) strains. Daptomycin is the drug of choice for rescue therapy in cases of MRSA endocarditis in which vancomycin has failed. The appropriate dose of daptomycin has not yet been established; however, for treatment of left-sided endocarditis the dose of daptomycin should be higher than the recommended dose of 6mg/kg/day. Combination antibiotic therapy with daptomycin (e.g. combined with fosfomycin) is a promising treatment for MRSA endocarditis and warrants further investigation. In vivo studies show that daptomycin is superior to vancomycin in the treatment of meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci experimental endocarditis, although clinical data are required. Daptomycin could represent an efficacious treatment for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium endocarditis. Finally, the pharmacokinetic profile of daptomycin makes it an excellent drug for outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the enniatin B, produced by Fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The enniatins (ENs) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of Fusarium sp. The EN B was purified from extracts of Fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (PDB), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (LC) followed by an analytical LC. The purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) study. The pure fraction of EN B was utilized to determine the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. The results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, EN B induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms tested and no significant differences over control were detected when Caco-2 cells were exposed to EN B, at any of the concentrations used.
TI  - Spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  - Bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. The characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. The clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation from January 1997 to March 2006 were reviewed. One hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (GPB), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (GNB). Nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset GPB or GNB versus patients with late-onset GPB (66.7% versus 23.7%, P < 0.001) or GNB (70.6% versus 20.0%, P = 0.001). Peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, P = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, P = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset GPB versus patients with late-onset GPB. Likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset GNB than late-onset GNB (41.2% versus 6.7%, P = 0.007). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GPB, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus species were most common in patients with late-onset GPB. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GNB, whereas Escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset GNB. In conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.
TI  - Clinical experience with daptomycin in Europe: the first 2.5 years.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the patient populations and infections being treated with daptomycin, as well as the efficacy and safety outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from the European Cubicin Outcomes Registry and Experience (EU-CORESM), retrospectively collected at 118 institutions between January 2006 and August 2008, were analysed. RESULTS: Daptomycin treatment was documented in 1127 patients with diverse infections, including complicated skin and soft tissue infections (33%), bacteraemia (22%), endocarditis (12%) and osteomyelitis (6%). It was used empirically, before microbiological results became available, in 53% of patients. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (34%), with 52% of isolates resistant to methicillin; coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci were also frequent, with 22% of Enterococcus faecium isolates resistant to vancomycin. Daptomycin was used as first-line therapy in 302 (27%) patients. When used second line, the most common reasons for discontinuation of previous antibiotic were treatment failure and toxicity or intolerance. The use of concomitant antibiotics was reported in 65% of patients. Most frequent doses were 6 mg/kg (47%) and 4 mg/kg (32%). The median duration of daptomycin therapy was 10 days (range 1-246 days) in the inpatient setting and 13 days (range 2-189 days) in the outpatient setting. The overall clinical success rate was 79%, with a clinical failure rate of <10% for all infection types. Low failure rates were observed in first- and second-line therapy (6% and 8%, respectively). Daptomycin demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile regardless of treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin has a relevant role in the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of linezolid in liver transplant patients.
AB  - Bacterial infections are the main cause of death within the first year after liver transplantation, and the increased incidence of multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens has created a major challenge in the treatment of these patients. Linezolid, the first US Food & Drug Administration-approved oxazolidinone, offers a valuable novel treatment option for serious gram-positive infections. Linezolid is relatively non-toxic but prolonged treatment with linezolid was associated with thrombocytopenia. Here we report on the experience of linezolid treatment in adult liver transplant patients, who are at an increased risk for thrombocytopenia because of hypersplenism. From November 2003 until December 2009, we evaluated the clinical course of 46 liver transplant patients (27 male/19 female) in our surgical intensive care unit. For proven or probable gram-positive infection, all patients received linezolid 600 mg intravenously every 12 h. On clinical improvement, treatment was changed to oral linezolid 600 mg twice daily. Treatment duration was 11 +/- 7 days. Treatment indications were pneumonia (n = 8), blood stream infection (n = 30), and surgical site/abdominal infection (n = 3). Clinical cure was achieved in 43 out of 46 patients. During the course of treatment, no cases of severe thrombocytopenia occurred and a statistically significant platelet count increase was seen from day 1 (110 +/- 73/nL) to day 7 (165 +/- 116/nL) and day 14 (180 +/- 140/nL). We did not observe any further adverse events, especially no severe neurological complications (e.g., serotonin syndrome) or signs of lactate acidosis. Two patients died from uncontrolled vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium sepsis with septic shock and one due to uncontrolled methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. These deaths were considered to be unrelated to linezolid treatment, and linezolid was regarded as the optimal treatment choice in these patients. A subgroup analysis of patients treated for >14 days revealed no statistically significant differences when compared with patients on shorter treatment. In particular, no cases of thrombocytopenia occurred during longer treatment. In conclusion, linezolid is a safe and effective treatment for adult liver transplant patients with gram-positive infections.
TI  - Case report of a successful treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and MRSA/vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium cholecystitis by daptomycin.
AB  - A 72-year-old man, receiving 8 mg daptomycin/kg body weight/day for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, was diagnosed with MRSA/vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) cholecystitis (daptomycin MIC values, 1 and 2 mg/liter, respectively). After the fifth drug dose, the bile concentration of daptomycin was 66 mg/liter 5 min after drug administration, with the biliary concentration/MIC values higher than 30 for both bacterial strains. Therefore, daptomycin achieved therapeutic levels in bile, hence suggesting a role for the drug in the treatment of MRSA/VRE cholecystitis.
TI  - [Causative agents of intravenous catheter-related infections and their antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  - Intravenous catheterization can lead to colonization as well as a broad spectrum  of infections ranging from catheter site infections to catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSIs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of causative agents and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in CRBSIs and catheter site infections along with the colonization rates and colonizing microorganisms in Zonguldak Karaelmas University Hospital, Turkey. The results of cultures from catheter tips and/or intracatheter blood cultures and simultaneously taken peripheral blood cultures were sent to medical microbiology laboratory and were retrospectively investigated for 201 patients hospitalized between September 2007 and September 2009. The catheter tips were cultured by semi-quantitative and quantitative culture methods. Blood cultures from the catheters and peripheral veins were performed in BACTEC 9120 (Becton Dickinson, USA) blood culture systems. The antibiotic susceptibility tests were done by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Out of 201 patients included, 28 (13.9%) had CRBSIs and 13 (6.4%) had catheter site infections while colonization was defined for 55 (27.3%) patients. Of 28 patients with CRBSIs, Acinetobacter spp. were isolated from 11 including five carbapenem-resistant strains, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS) from eight, methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCNS) from two, Klebsiella pneumoniae from two patients and one of each patient's cultures yielded methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli and MRCNS + Enterococcus faecium. Of 13 patients with catheter site infections, five MSCNS, two methicillin-susceptible S.aureus (MSSA), two E.coli, and one of each K.pneumoniae, MRCNS, Enterococcus spp., K.pneumoniae + P.aeruginosa were isolated. No resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin were detected among the staphylococci isolated from CRBSIs and catheter site infections. The distribution of the 55 colonizing microorganisms were as follows; 18 MSCNS, 18 MRCNS, four Acinetobacter spp., five K.pneumoniae, three E.coli, two MSSA, and one of each MRSA, P.mirabilis, P.aeruginosa, Corynebacterium spp., Candida albicans. In this study, the predominant microorganism isolated from CRBSIs was Acinetobacter spp., followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci. This unexpected distribution of the agents was related to the Acinetobacter spp. that have gained endemic potential following an Acinetobacter outbreak in our hospital in 2006. We emphasize that it is critical for any individual hospital to assess periodically the distribution and susceptibility profiles of isolates obtained from catheter-related infections to set out rational empirical treatment strategies.
TI  - Growth advantage in stationary phase phenomenon in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae including metallo-beta-lactamase producers are predominant pathogens of healthcare-associated infections in an Indian teaching hospital.
AB  - PURPOSE: A study was carried out in an Indian teaching hospital in 2009 to detect the rate of surgical site infections (SSI) and peripheral vascular access site infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a point-prevalence study involving over 300 patients. The presence of infection was determined according to the CDC criteria. Swabs were taken from the infected sites and identification and sensitivity were carried out using VITEK(R) 2 automated system. Characterisation of beta-lactamase was carried out at ARRML, Colindale, London. RESULTS: The rate of SSI was 15% for the clean and clean-contaminated categories while that for the dirty contaminated category was 85% (NNIS risk index 0). Cultures yielded definite or probable pathogens from 64% (9/14) of the patients with SSI. In 1/3 rd of the cultures, Staphylococcus aureus was grown and the rest had Enterobacteriaceae, either extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers or Amp-C hyperproducers and, alarmingly, three isolates were positive for newly recognised New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). In medicine, 87% (n = 99) of the patients had a peripheral IV access device, 55% developed associated phlebitis/infection and, in seven, probable pathogens were isolated (Candida species and Escherichia coli producing ESBL and NDM-1, respectively, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). All ESBL and metallo-beta-lactamase producers were resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials, the latter being sensitive only to colistin and tigecycline. The study also found that all post-operative patients were on antibiotics, 92% on IV [213 defined daily doses (DDD)/100 post-op patients] limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (26%) and aminoglycosides (24%) and imidazole derivatives (30%). In medicine, 83% (n = 82) were on IV antibiotics (123 DDD/100 bed-days), limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (74%). CONCLUSION: Indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a major problem predisposing patients to harm by multi-resistant pathogens. Carbapenems were in little use in this hospital, but the selection pressure exerted by cephalosporins and other unrelated classes was sufficient to select NDM-1-producing strains due to co-selection, suggesting a role of single plasmid carrying resistance genes to multiple classes.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. MICs of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight French hospitals. Disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM). The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by MIC(50/90) (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/L), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant CoNS, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.25/1; Enterococcus faecium, 64/128; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. According to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for MICs of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA but not E. faecium, whilst maintaining a Gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. Thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Vancomycin-dependent Enterococcus faecium vanA: characterization of the first case isolated in a university hospital in Brazil.
AB  - In this study, we report the characterization of a strain of Enterococcus faecium vanA, which grows only in the presence of vancomycin (VDEfm-UEL). The bacterium was isolated from the feces of a female patient who had undergone surgical treatment of Reinke's edema and was receiving intravenous vancomycin therapy for infection with methicillin/oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a postoperative complication. Antimicrobial dependence was further confirmed by the vancomycin E-test. VDEfm-UEL was also shown to be resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, levofloxacin, penicillin, rifampicin, and teicoplanin. The putative virulence genes efaA, gelE and esp were detected by PCR. The ddl gene from VDEfm-UEL was cloned and sequenced. Vancomycin dependence seems to be associated with the insertion of a nucleotide in that sequence, which results in a frame-shift mutation, introducing a premature stop codon. This is the first report of vancomycin-dependent E. faecium isolation in a university hospital in Brazil.
TI  - Co-emergence of linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium in a patient with methicillin-resistant S. aureus pneumonic sepsis.
AB  
TI  - Vancomycin-resistance transferability from VanA enterococci to Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In last decade methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with high level of vancomycin-resistance (VRSA) have been reported and generally the patients with VRSA infection were also infected with a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Considering that the high level of vancomycin-resistance in VRSA isolates seems to involve the horizontal transfer of Tn1546 transposon containing vanA gene from coinfecting VRE strains, the authors have studied the "in vitro" conjugative transfer of this resistance from VanA enterococci to S. aureus. Out of 25 matings performed combining five vancomycin-resistant enterococci as donors (three Enterococcus faecalis and two Enterococcus faecium), and five S. aureus as recipients, all clinical isolates, two have been successful using E. faecalis as donor. The transfer of vancomycin-resistance was confirmed by vanA gene amplification in both transconjugants and the resistance was expressed at lower levels (MIC 32 mug/ml) in comparison with the respective VRE donors (MIC > 128 mug/ml). The vancomycin-resistance of trasconjugants was maintained even after subsequent overnight passages on MSA plates containing subinhibitory levels of vancomycin. This study shows that the vanA gene transfer can be achieved through techniques "in vitro" without the use of laboratory animals employed, in the only similar experiment previously carried out by other authors, as substrate for the trasconjugant growth. Moreover, in that previous experiment, contrary to this study, the vancomycin resistant S. aureus trasconjugants were selected on erythromycin agar and not by direct vancomycin agar selection.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - Telavancin Activity against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - Telavancin is approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in adults caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms. The antimicrobial activity of telavancin and comparators was evaluated against 5,027 (2007-2008) Gram-positive bacteria responsible for SSSI in medical centers in Asia-Pacific, European, Latin American, and North American regions. Telavancin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l). telavancin inhibited all Enterococcus faecalis, including four strains displaying a VanB phenotype, at </= 1 mg/L (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mg/l), except for two isolates with a VanA phenotype (MIC, >2 mg/l). Vancomycin-susceptible and VanB vancomycin-resistant E. faecium were inhibited by telavancin at </= 0.25 mg/L, while this drug exhibited elevated MIC values (>/= 0.5 mg/l) against E. faecium of VanA phenotype (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 2/>2 mg/l). Telavancin was potent against beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). These in vitro data document the activity of telavancin against contemporary Gram-positive isolates and support its clinical use for the treatment of cSSSI caused by the indicated pathogens.
TI  - Treatment of meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium: high-dose and combination daptomycin therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report 3 successful treatments of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium meningitis in adults using daptomycin and either linezolid or gentamicin. CASE SUMMARY: Three case reports involving males (aged 58-78 years) are presented; in each case (trigeminal nerve microvascular decompression and subdural hygroma; paraspinal abscess; and hydrocephalus with subsequent craniotomy and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement) CSF examination revealed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) susceptible to daptomycin, gentamicin, and/or linezolid. Threeto four-week treatment regimens with daptomycin 6-12 mg/kg and either gentamicin or linezolid led to clinical resolution and microbiological clearance of infection. DISCUSSION: Daptomycin has previously been shown to be successful in treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated meningitis and other serious VRE and enterococcal infections. Higher than approved doses of daptomycin were used in 2 cases where in theory higher CSF concentrations would thus be obtained. Gentamicin and linezolid were added to daptomycin therapy based on in vitro data synergy results and because of documented successful treatment for VRE meningitis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The difficulty in treating VRE CSF infections involves both drug kinetics and microbial resistance factors, as well as external factors such as foreign bodies like shunts. This report highlighted 3 cases where daptomycin use in concert with either gentamicin or linezolid was successful in treating this infection. Additional controlled trials will be helpful in identifying the best strategies when using daptomycin to treat CSF infections.
TI  - Photodynamic inactivation of multi-resistant bacteria (PIB) - a new approach to treat superficial infections in the 21st century.
AB  - The increasing resistance of bacteria against antibiotics is one of the most important clinical challenges of the 21(st) century. Within the gram-positive bacteria the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium represent the major obstacle to successful therapy. Apart from the development of new antibiotics it requires additional differently constituted approaches, like photodynamic inactivation in order to have further effective treatment options against bacteria available. Certain dyes, termed photosensitizers, are able to store the absorbed energy in long-lived electronic states upon light activation with appropriate wavelengths and thus make these states available for chemical activation of the immediate surroundings. The interaction with molecular oxygen, which leads to different, very reactive and thus cytotoxic oxygen species, is highlighted. In this review the application of the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria will be discussed regarding the possible indications in dermatology, like localized skin and wound infections or the reduction of nosocomial colonization with multi-resistant bacteria on the skin. The crucial advantage of the local application of photosensitizers followed by irradiation of the area of interest is the fact that independent of the resistance pattern of a bacterium a direct inactivation takes place similarly as with an antiseptic. In this review the physical-chemical and biological basics of photo-dynamic inactivation of bacteria (PIB) will be discussed as well as the possible dermatological indications.
TI  - Characterization of lytic enzyme open reading frame 9 (ORF9) derived from Enterococcus faecalis bacteriophage phiEF24C.
AB  - In bacteriophage (phage) therapy against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis, members of a genus of SPO1-like viruses are typically employed because of their extreme virulence and broad host spectrum. Phage phiEF24C, which is a SPO1-like virus infecting E. faecalis, has previously been characterized as a therapeutic phage candidate. In addition to the phage itself, phage endolysin is also recognized as an effective antimicrobial agent. In this study, a putative endolysin gene (orf9) of E. faecalis phage phiEF24C was analyzed in silico, and its activity was characterized using the recombinant form. First, bioinformatics analysis predicted that the open reading frame 9 (ORF9) protein is N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase. Second, bacteriolytic and bactericidal activities of ORF9 against E. faecalis were confirmed by zymography, decrease of peptidoglycan turbidity, decrease of the viable count, and morphological analysis of ORF9-treated cells. Third, ORF9 did not appear to require Zn(2+) ions for its activity, contrary to the bioinformatics prediction of a Zn(2+) ion requirement. Fourth, the lytic spectrum was from 97.1% (34 out of 35 strains, including vancomycin-resistant strains) of E. faecalis strains to 60% (6 out of 10 strains) of Enterococcus faecium strains. Fifth, N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activity of ORF9 was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and the subsequent MALDI-postsource decay (PSD) analyses. Finally, functional analysis using N- or C-terminally deleted ORF9 mutants suggested that a complete ORF9 molecule is essential for its activity. These results suggested that ORF9 is an endolysin of phage phiEF24C and can be a therapeutic alternative to antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in France according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. The MICs of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight French hospitals. The disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according to the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CASFM) method. The MIC(50/90) (mg/L) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCoNS) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) (2/8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), Enterococcus faecalis (2/4), Enterococcus faecium (128/>128), Enterobacteriaceae (0.06/0.25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), Haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). According to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for MICs of 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. This study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, MSSA, MSCoNS, and respiratory pathogens. According to the EUCAST MIC breakpoints (mg/L) </=1/>4 for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of telavancin studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of telavancin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against six  Staphylococcus aureus strains (1 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA] strain, 4 methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] strains, and 1 vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA] strain) and three Enterococcus sp. strains (1 Enterococcus faecalis strain, 1 Enterococcus faecium strain, and 1 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium [VREF] strain) were compared using an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection. Analyzing the data from all five vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) strains or all 4 MRSA strains showed that telavancin was superior in its antibacterial effect as measured by the area under the bacterial kill curve at 24 h (AUBKC(24)) and 48 h (AUBKC(48)) in comparison to vancomycin or teicoplanin (P < 0.05). Telavancin was also superior to vancomycin and teicoplanin in terms of its greater early killing effect (P < 0.05). Against the three Enterococcus spp. tested, telavancin was superior to vancomycin in terms of its AUBKC(24), AUBKC(48), and greater early bactericidal effect (P < 0.05). Dose-ranging studies were performed to provide free-drug area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h in the steady state divided by the MIC (fAUC/MIC) exposures from 0 to 1,617 (7 to 14 exposures per strain) for 5 VSSA, 4 VISA, and the 3 Enterococcus strains. The fAUC/MIC values for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect and a 1-log-unit drop in the viable count were 43.1 +/- 38.4 and 50.0 +/- 39.0 for VSSA, 3.2 +/- 1.3 and 4.3 +/- 1.3 for VISA, and 15.1 +/- 8.8 and 40.1 +/- 29.4 for the Enterococcus spp., respectively. The reason for the paradoxically low fAUC/MIC values for VISA strains is unknown. There was emergence of resistance to telavancin in the dose-ranging studies, as indicated by subpopulations able to grow on plates containing 2x MIC telavancin concentrations compared to the preexposure population analysis profiles. Changes in population analysis profiles were less likely with enterococci than with S. aureus, and the greatest risk of changed profiles occurred for both species at fAUC/MIC ratios of 1 to 10. Maintaining a fAUC/MIC ratio of >50 reduced the risk of subpopulations able to grow on antibiotic-containing media emerging. These data help explain the clinical effectiveness of telavancin against MRSA and indicate that telavancin may have clinically useful activity against Enterococcus spp., and perhaps also VISA, at human doses of 10 mg/kg of body weight/day. In addition, they support a clinical breakpoint of sensitive at </=1 mg/liter for both S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Antimicrobial characterisation of solithromycin (CEM-101), a novel fluoroketolide: activity against staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  - Solithromycin (CEM-101) is a novel fluoroketolide with high potency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. In this study, solithromycin and comparator antimicrobials were tested against a contemporary collection of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and other Enterococcus spp. collected in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Solithromycin was active against S. aureus [minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms (MIC(50))=0.12 mug/mL] and was two-fold more active than telithromycin (MIC(50)=0.25 mug/mL). Solithromycin was more potent against methicillin (oxacillin)-susceptible S. aureus [MIC(50)=0.06 mug/mL and MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=0.12 mug/mL) compared with methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant S. aureus (MIC(50)=0.12 mug/mL and MIC(90)>16 mug/mL). Solithromycin activity was reduced amongst heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (MIC(50)>16 mug/mL). Against strains with defined susceptibilities to erythromycin, clindamycin and telithromycin, solithromycin showed potent inhibition against all combinations (MIC(50)=0.06 mug/mL) except those with non-susceptibility to telithromycin (>2 mug/mL) (MIC(50)>16 mug/mL). The solithromycin MIC(50) for E. faecium (1 mug/mL) was four-fold higher than the MIC(50) for E. faecalis (0.25 mug/mL). In summary, solithromycin demonstrated high potency against many Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp. isolated from contemporary infections worldwide.
TI  - Infectious complications in the early postoperative period in liver transplant patients.
AB  - Liver transplantation (LTx) is a technically well established procedure in acute  and in end-stage liver diseases. However, opportunistic infections remain one of the important complications in short and long-term outcome of LTx patients. Bloodstream and pulmonary infections are the major cause of death in the first year following liver transplantation. Due to extended use of chinolons and third generation cephalosporines there is a shift towards multidrug-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and extended b-lactamase-producing gram negative rods. Fungal infections are mainly due to Candida spp. Viral infections, such as with cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus infections are another major cause of morbidity in patients receiving solid organ transplants, including liver transplant patients. Studies of infection following LTx are necessary to improve management and to provide a better outcome after LTx. This review focuses on the most important bacterial, fungal and viral infections in LTx patients.
TI  - Progress and challenges in implementing the research on ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - The ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. Over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. However, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. In addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. The difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.
TI  - Medical-grade honey enriched with antimicrobial peptides has enhanced activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Honey has potent activity against both antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, and is an interesting agent for topical antimicrobial application to wounds. As honey is diluted by wound exudate, rapid bactericidal activity up to high dilution is a prerequisite for its successful application. We investigated the kinetics of the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by RS honey, the source for the production of Revamil(R) medical-grade honey, and we aimed to enhance the rapid bactericidal activity of RS honey by enrichment with its endogenous compounds or the addition of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). RS honey killed antibiotic-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and Burkholderia cepacia within 2 h, but lacked such rapid activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli. It was not feasible to enhance the rapid activity of RS honey by enrichment with endogenous compounds, but RS honey enriched with 75 muM of the synthetic peptide Bactericidal Peptide 2 (BP2) showed rapid bactericidal activity against all species tested, including MRSA and ESBL E. coli, at up to 10-20-fold dilution. RS honey enriched with BP2 rapidly killed all bacteria tested and had a broader spectrum of bactericidal activity than either BP2 or honey alone.
TI  - Increase of ceftazidime- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and  imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: analysis of KONSAR study data from 2005 and 2007.
AB  - PURPOSE: Antimicrobial resistance monitoring could be a useful source of information for treating and controlling nosocomial infections. We analyzed antimicrobial resistance data generated by Korean Hospitals and by a commercial laboratory in 2005 and 2007. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Susceptibility data for 2005 and 2007 were collected from 37 and 41 hospitals, respectively, and from one commercial laboratory. Intermediate susceptibility was not included in the calculation of resistance rates. RESULTS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (64%), third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli (27%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%), and Acinetobacter spp. (48%), and amikacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (19%) and Acinetobacter spp. (37%) were prevalent in hospitals in 2007. A gradual increase of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. was observed. Higher incidences of thirdgeneration cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae and imipenemresistant P. aeruginosa were found in the commercial laboratory than in the hospitals. CONCLUSION: Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, third-generation cephalosporin- resistant K. pneumoniae, and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. remain prevalent in Korea, while the incidence of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. has increased gradually. The higher prevalences of third-generation cephalosporinresistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa in the commercial laboratory are a new concern.
TI  - Characterization of phenolic content, in vitro biological activity, and pesticide loads of extracts from white grape skins from organic and conventional cultivars.
AB  - Grape skin extracts of Riesling Vitis vinifera L. grapes from conventionally or organically managed cultivars were compared on the basis of their phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties and pesticide loads. Promising results on their biological properties suggest that those extracts would be valuable as food preservatives. The antioxidant capacity of conventional extracts was significantly higher, according to the higher content in catechin, epicatechin and procyanidin B. Pesticide loads did not affect the antimutagenic or antimicrobial properties of the extracts. Both extracts inhibited the growth of Gram-positive foodborne pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium to similar extents. Possibly as a result of higher amounts of quercetin and its derivatives, higher antimicrobial effects against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium were observed for the organic white grape skin extracts. Conventional or organic extracts did not show remarkable antimutagenic effects when tested against the mutagen IQ by means of the Ames test. Due to the presence of fungicides, the conidial germination of Penicillium expansum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus niger, were inhibited by 95% by conventional GSE, while negligible effects were observed with organic grape extracts. The latter, however, showed inhibitory effects against Trichoderma viridie and Aspergillus versicolor.
TI  - Evaluation of the DiversiLab system for detection of hospital outbreaks of infections by different bacterial species.
AB  - Many bacterial typing methods are specific for one species only, time-consuming,  or poorly reproducible. DiversiLab (DL; bioMerieux) potentially overcomes these limitations. In this study, we evaluated the DL system for the identification of hospital outbreaks of a number bacterial species. Appropriately typed clinical isolates were tested with DL. DL typing agreed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for Acinetobacter (n = 26) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13) isolates. With two exceptions, DL typing of Klebsiella isolates (n = 23) also correlated with PFGE, and in addition, PFGE-nontypeable (PFGE-NT) isolates could be typed. Enterobacter (n = 28) results also correlated with PFGE results; also, PFGE-NT isolates could be clustered. In a larger study (n = 270), a cluster of 30 isolates was observed that could be subdivided by PFGE. The results for Escherichia coli (n = 38) correlated less well with an experimental multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) scheme. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 52) showed only a limited number of amplification products for most isolates. When multiple Pseudomonas isolates were assigned to a single type in DL, all except one showed multiple multilocus sequence types. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus generally also showed a limited number of amplification products. Isolates that belonged to different outbreaks by other typing methods, including PFGE, spa typing, and MLVA, were grouped together in a number of cases. For Enterococcus faecium, the limited variability of the amplification products obtained made interpretation difficult and correlation with MLVA and esp gene typing was poor. All of the results are reflected in Simpson's index of diversity and adjusted Rand's and Wallace's coefficients. DL is a useful tool to help identify hospital outbreaks of Acinetobacter spp., S. maltophilia, the Enterobacter cloacae complex, Klebsiella spp., and, to a somewhat lesser extent, E. coli. In our study, DL was inadequate for P. aeruginosa, E. faecium, and MRSA. However, it should be noted that for the identification of outbreaks, epidemiological data should be combined with typing results.
TI  - Telavancin activity against Gram-positive bacteria isolated from respiratory tract specimens of patients with nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antimicrobial activity of telavancin against 2279 clinical Gram-positive cocci obtained from patients with nosocomial pneumonia [NP; including those with ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)] located in numerous medical centres worldwide was evaluated. METHODS: A contemporary collection of 2279 non-duplicate consecutive Gram-positive clinical isolates were submitted from 87 hospitals located in North America (913 isolates), Latin America (222 isolates), Europe (690 isolates), and the Asia-Pacific region (454 isolates) as part of the international telavancin surveillance programme for 2007-08. Isolates were tested for susceptibility by the reference broth microdilution method (with 2%-5% lysed horse blood added for testing of streptococci). Interpretive criteria were those from CLSI (M100-S20, 2010) except for telavancin, for which the susceptible breakpoints approved by the US FDA were applied. RESULTS: Telavancin was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(90), 0.25 mg/L; 100% susceptible), coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(90), 0.25 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.03 mg/L), viridans group streptococci (MIC(90), 0.06 mg/L; 100% susceptible), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(90), 0.06 mg/L; 100% susceptible) and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90), 0.5 mg/L; 100% susceptible). Telavancin inhibited all staphylococci at </= 0.5 mg/L. Among enterococci non-susceptible to vancomycin (all Enterococcus faecium), telavancin was active against isolates exhibiting a VanB phenotype (MIC, 0.06-0.12 mg/L), but less potent against VanA strains (MIC, >/= 2 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin demonstrated equal or greater potency than the comparators (vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin) against Gram-positive pathogens implicated in NP. Telavancin showed elevated MIC values only against enterococcus isolates showing a VanA phenotype. The continued appearance of multidrug-resistant pathogens among Gram-positive isolates, mainly S. aureus, necessitates the introduction of new agents and longitudinal surveillance to monitor for the potential emergence of resistance.
TI  - Superhydrophilicity and antibacterial property of a Cu-dotted oxide coating surface.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aluminum-made settings are widely used in healthcare, schools, public facilities and transit systems. Frequently-touched surfaces of those settings are likely to harbour bacteria and be a potential source of infection. One method to utilize the effectiveness of copper (Cu) in eliminating pathogens for these surfaces would be to coat the aluminum (Al) items with a Cu coating. However, such a combination of Cu and Al metals is susceptible to galvanic corrosion because of their different electrochemical potentials. METHODS: In this work, a new approach was proposed in which electrolytic plasma oxidation (EPO) of Al was used to form an oxide surface layer followed by electroplating of Cu metal on the top of the oxide layer. The oxide was designed to function as a corrosion protective and biocompatible layer, and the Cu in the form of dots was utilized as an antibacterial material. The antibacterial property enhanced by superhydrophilicity of the Cu-dotted oxide coating was evaluated. RESULTS: A superhydrophilic surface was successfully prepared using electrolytic plasma oxidation of aluminum (Al) followed by electroplating of copper (Cu) in a Cu-dotted form. Both Cu plate and Cu-dotted oxide surfaces had excellent antimicrobial activities against E. coli ATCC 25922, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300 and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) ATCC 51299. However, its Cu-dotted surface morphology allowed the Cu-dotted oxide surface to be more antibacterial than the smooth Cu plate surface. The enhanced antibacterial property was attributed to the superhydrophilic behaviour of the Cu-dotted oxide surface that allowed the bacteria to have a more effective killing contact with Cu due to spreading of the bacterial suspension media. CONCLUSION: The superhydrophilic Cu-dotted oxide coating surface provided an effective method of controlling bacterial growth and survival on contact surfaces and thus reduces the risk of infection and spread of bacteria-related diseases particularly in moist or wet environments.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolone derivatives containing 3-(N'-alkoxycarbamimidoyl)-4-(alkoxyimino) pyrrolidines.
AB  - A series of novel 7-[3-(N'-alkoxycarbamimidoyl)-4-(alkoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl] fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by (1)H NMR, MS and HRMS. These fluoroquinolones were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity. Most of them exhibit good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC: 0.06-4.00 mug/mL). The activity of compounds 33 and 43 against S. aureus including MRSA and S. epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.06-0.125 mug/mL) is more than or comparable to the reference drugs levofloxacin and gemifloxacin. In addition, compound 33 is 32 and 16-32 fold more potent than both the reference drugs against Enterococcus faecium 08-7 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 09-22, respectively.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  - Non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. The purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. Overall, Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than Gram-positive bacteria. For the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. Staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the Sa 78 and ATCC 6538 strains, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. Non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. Biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. Bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. A rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with P. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain Sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. A 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. A 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated P. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. A statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated animals after the third day of the course. Wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. Overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.
TI  - Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Muraymycin Analogues Active against Anti-Drug-Resistant Bacteria.
AB  - Muraymycin analogues with a lipophilic substituent were synthesized using an Ugi  four-component assemblage. This approach provides ready access to a range of analogues simply by altering the aldehyde component. The impact of the lipophilic substituent on the antibacterial activity was very large, and analogues 7b-e and 8b-e exhibited good activity against a range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. This study also showed that the accessory urea-dipeptide motif contributes to MraY inhibitory and antibacterial activity. The knowledge obtained from our structure-activity relationship study of muraymycins provides further direction toward the design of potent MraY inhibitors. This study has set the stage for the generation of novel antibacterial "lead" compounds based on muraymycins.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococcus and enterococcus as predominant pathogens in liver transplant recipients with Gram-positive coccal bacteremia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus have been a common cause of infection among liver transplant (LT) recipients in recent decades. The understanding of local epidemiology and its evolving trends with regard to pathogenic spectra and antibiotic susceptibility is beneficial to prophylactic and empiric treatment for LT recipients. This study aimed to investigate etiology, timing, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-positive coccal bacteremia after LT. METHODS: A cohort analysis of prospectively recorded data was performed to investigate etiologies, timing, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for MDR Gram-positive coccal bacteremia in 475 LT recipients. RESULTS: In 475 LT recipients in the first six months after LT, there were a total of 98 episodes of bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci in 82 (17%) patients. Seventy-five (77%) bacteremic episodes occurred in the first post-LT month. The most frequent Gram-positive cocci were methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS, 46 isolates), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 13) and enterococcus (34, E. faecium 30, E. faecalis 4). In all Gram-positive bacteremic isolates, 59 of 98 (60%) were MDR. Gram-positive coccal bacteremia and MDR Gram-positive coccal bacteremia predominantly occurred in patients with acute severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B and with fulminant/subfulminant hepatitis. Four independent risk factors for development of bacteremia caused by MDR Gram-positive coccus were: LT candidates with encephalopathy grades II - IV (P = 0.013, OR: 16.253, 95%CI: 1.822 - 144.995), pre-LT use of empirical antibiotics (P = 0.018, OR: 1.029, 95%CI: 1.002 - 1.057), post-LT urinary tract infections (P < 0.001, OR: 20.340, 95%CI: 4.135 - 100.048) and abdominal infection (P = 0.004, OR: 2.820, 95%CI: 1.122 - 10.114). The main infectious manifestations were coinfections due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin-resistant CoNS and enterococci are predominant pathogens among LT recipients with Gram-positive coccal bacteremia. Occurrences of Gram-positive coccal bacteremia may be associated with the severity of illness in the perioperative stage.
TI  - [Evaluation of MicroScan Synergies plus Positive Combo 3 Panels for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus species].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the performance of the recently introduced MicroScan Synergies plus Positive Combo 3 Panels (SIPC3) (Dade Behring Inc., USA). We evaluated the clinical efficacy of the panels in identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. METHODS: To evaluate the panels' accuracy of identification, the results obtained using the test panels were compared with those obtained by using conventional biochemical tests in conjunction with VITEK 2 system (bio-Merieux, USA). In addition, the AST results obtained using the panels were compared with those obtained by performing CLSI broth microdilution. RESULTS: The overall agreement between the approaches for the ID of S. aureus and enterococci was 100% and 96%, respectively. The categorical and essential agreements (CA and EA) for S. aureus were 98%, each. Very major errors (VME), major errors (ME), and minor error (mE) for S. aureus were 0.45%, 0.3%, and 4.2%, respectively. The majority of VMEs were for oxacillin (8.6%), penicillin (2.0%), erythromycin (7.9%), clindamycin (3.8%), and tetracycline (4.1%). For enterococci, the CA, EA, VME, ME, and mE were 88.8%, 93.7%, 4.4%, 0%, and 2.8%, respectively. The 80.5% (29/36) of Enterococcus faecium had concordant ID with the reference. Most of the categorical errors (3 VMEs and 14 mEs) were observed for quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid; Catalytica Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA). CONCLUSIONS: The panels compared favorably with conventional methods for the ID and AST of S. aureus. However, we expected a better performance for ID of E. faecium and AST using Synercid.
TI  - Microbiological findings of culture-positive preservation fluid in liver transplantation.
AB  - Bacterial and fungal infections are the leading cause of mortality in liver transplant (LT) recipients. Few studies have examined the incidence of culture-positive preservation fluid (PF) and the outcome of related recipients. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and the microbiologic findings of PF positive cultures, and to evaluate the impact on morbidity and mortality of LT recipients. A retrospective analysis of PF cultures performed after 477 LTs from cadaveric grafts between January 2001 and February 2008 was conducted. Forty-five (9.5%) PFs were found to be positive with 1 or 2 pathogens. The demographic profiles of recipients of PF with positive or negative cultures were similar. Enterobacteriaceae species were the most frequent organisms (n = 30), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 5), enterococci (n = 4), and yeasts (n = 3). Mortality rate at 1 month was not significantly different in recipients with positive or sterile PF cultures (88.1% vs. 87.7%, respectively). The rate of bacteremia among LT recipients with positive or negative PF cultures was not statistically different. Systemic infections caused by the pathogen cultured from the PF occurred in 8 (18%) of the 45 recipients, including bacteremia (4/8) or intra-abdominal sepsis (5/8). Causative organisms were Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 5), Candida species (n = 2), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 1). Among the 8 patients who developed infection with the PF organism, 4 (50%) died in the intensive care unit (ICU) vs. an ICU mortality rate of 8% (3/37) in those who did not develop infection with the PF organism (P < 0.05). Infection occurred less frequently in recipients who received antimicrobial therapy with activity against the PF isolate than in those without appropriate treatment (41% vs. 3.8%, P < 0.005). Those who develop infection with organisms recovered from PF cultures appear to have high early mortality rates; therefore, appropriate antimicrobial therapy against organisms cultured from PF should be given.
TI  - Evaluation of pathogen detection from clinical samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction using a sepsis pathogen DNA detection kit.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sepsis is a serious medical condition that requires rapidly administered, appropriate antibiotic treatment. Conventional methods take three or more days for final pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We organized a prospective observational multicenter study in three study sites to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and potential clinical utility of the SeptiFast system, a multiplex pathogen detection system used in the clinical setting to support early diagnosis of bloodstream infections. METHODS: A total of 212 patients, suspected of having systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by bacterial or fungal infection, were enrolled in the study. From these patients, 407 blood samples were taken and blood culture analysis was performed to identify pathogens. Whole blood was also collected for DNA Detection Kit analysis immediately after its collection for blood culture. The results of the DNA Detection Kit, blood culture and other culture tests were compared. The chosen antimicrobial treatment in patients whose samples tested positive in the DNA Detection Kit and/or blood culture analysis was examined to evaluate the effect of concomitant antibiotic exposure on the results of these analyses. RESULTS: SeptiFast analysis gave a positive result for 55 samples, while 43 samples were positive in blood culture analysis. The DNA Detection Kit identified a pathogen in 11.3% (45/400) of the samples, compared to 8.0% (32/400) by blood culture analysis. Twenty-three pathogens were detected by SeptiFast only; conversely, this system missed five episodes of clinically significant bacteremia (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 2; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1; Klebsiella spp, 1; Enterococcus faecium, 1). The number of samples that tested positive was significantly increased by combining the result of the blood culture analysis with those of the DNA Detection Kit analysis (P = 0.01). Among antibiotic pre-treated patients (prevalence, 72%), SeptiFast analysis detected more bacteria/fungi, and was less influenced by antibiotic exposure, compared with blood culture analysis (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This rapid multiplex pathogen detection system complemented traditional culture-based methods and offered some added diagnostic value for the timely detection of causative pathogens, particularly in antibiotic pre-treated patients. Adequately designed intervention studies are needed to prove its clinical effectiveness in improving appropriate antibiotic selection and patient outcomes.
TI  - Isolation and identification of Enterococcus faecium from seafoods: antimicrobial resistance and production of bacteriocin-like substances.
AB  - A collection of isolates from uncooked seafoods (molluscs, fish, and fish fillets) were identified as Enterococcus faecium species and studied in further detail. Isolates were clustered in well-defined genomic groups according to food origin after ERIC-PCR analysis. Four isolates (FR 1-2, FB 1-3-B, FB 3-1, FTA 1-2) decarboxylated lysine, ornithine, and tyrosine. Isolate FR 1-2 also decarboxylated histidine. Most isolates were sensitive to antibiotics of clinical use, but resistance was detected more frequently towards nitrofurantoin (50%), erythromycin (33.33%) or rifampicin (33.33%) to quinupristin/dalfopristin (12.5%). Resistance to beta-lactams or vancomycin was not detected. The enterococcal antigen A was the presumed virulence trait detected most frequently. None of isolates carried haemolysin/cytolysin genes. Twelve isolates produced anti-listerial activity. Among them, seven isolates also produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances against other enterococci, and one isolate was also able to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus. Three isolates only were active against Listeria monocytogenes, and two only were active against enterococci. One bacteriocinogenic isolate carried the enterocin A structural gene, but genes corresponding to other enterocins (EntB, EntP, EntQ, Ent1071, EntL50A/EntL50B, and Ent31) were not detected. Bacteriocin-producing enterococci lacking undesirable traits (such as antibiotic resistance or biogenic amine production) or their produced bacteriocins could be potential candidates to aid in preservation of seafoods and other food products as well.
TI  - Dissemination of an Enterococcus Inc18-Like vanA plasmid associated with vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Of the 9 vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) cases reported to date in the literature, 7 occurred in Michigan. In 5 of the 7 Michigan VRSA cases, an Inc18-like vanA plasmid was identified in the VRSA isolate and/or an associated vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolate from the same patient. This plasmid may play a critical role in the emergence of VRSA. We studied the geographical distribution of the plasmid by testing 1,641 VRE isolates from three separate collections by PCR for plasmid-specific genes traA, repR, and vanA. Isolates from one collection (phase 2) were recovered from surveillance cultures collected in 17 hospitals in 13 states. All VRE isolates from 2 Michigan institutions (n = 386) and between 60 and 70 VRE isolates (n = 883) from the other hospitals were tested. Fifteen VRE isolates (3.9%) from Michigan were positive for an Inc18-like vanA plasmid (9 E. faecalis [12.5%], 3 E. faecium [1.0%], 2 E. avium, and 1 E. raffinosus). Six VRE isolates (0.6%) from outside Michigan were positive (3 E. faecalis [2.7%] and 3 E. faecium [0.4%]). Of all E. faecalis isolates tested, 6.0% were positive for the plasmid, compared to 0.6% for E. faecium and 3.0% for other spp. Fourteen of the 15 plasmid-positive isolates from Michigan had the same Tn1546 insertion site location as the VRSA-associated Inc18-like plasmid, whereas 5 of 6 plasmid-positive isolates from outside Michigan differed in this characteristic. Most plasmid-positive E. faecalis isolates demonstrated diverse patterns by PFGE, with the exception of three pairs with indistinguishable patterns, suggesting that the plasmid is mobile in nature. Although VRE isolates with the VRSA-associated Inc18-like vanA plasmid were more common in Michigan, they remain rare. Periodic surveillance of VRE isolates for the plasmid may be useful in predicting the occurrence of VRSA.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Worldwide summary of telavancin spectrum and potency against Gram-positive pathogens: 2007 to 2008 surveillance results.
AB  - Telavancin was approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of adult patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible Gram-positive isolates. In this study, telavancin and comparator antimicrobial activities were determined against a total of 24,017 clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CoNS), Enterococcus spp., and various Streptococcus spp. Overall, telavancin was highly active across all geographic regions for S. aureus (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 microg/mL), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 microg/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(50/90), < or =0.015/0.03 microg/mL), viridans group Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.06 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.12 microg/mL; 99.8% susceptible). Telavancin had potent activity against vancomycin-nonsusceptible, teicoplanin-susceptible (VanB) E. faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 microg/mL) and E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 microg/mL). These in vitro results show continued activity for telavancin, which represents an important alternative available for treating cSSSI.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - Inactivation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) on various environmental surfaces by mist application of a stabilized chlorine dioxide and quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant.
AB  - Contaminated environmental surfaces are important reservoirs in the transmission  of many human pathogens. Although several options exist for disinfecting contaminated environmental surfaces, few are compatible with use on both hard smooth non-porous (hard) and soft porous surfaces (soft) while still offering significant disinfection of the contaminating organisms. This study evaluated the efficacy of mist application of a stabilized chlorine dioxide and quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant (Cryocide20) for inactivation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) on various environmental surfaces. MRSA and VRE were applied to hard and soft surfaces (glass, steel, tile, carpet, and cotton fabric), allowed to dry, and exposed to a uniform mist application of the disinfectant solution. After 1 hr of contact time, the residual disinfectant was neutralized, and the bacteria were recovered and enumerated on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar. Reduction of both test bacteria was observed on most of the hard and soft surfaces tested. Log(10) reduction of the organisms tended to be higher on steel, tile, and carpet than glass or cotton. Overall, these results suggest that mist application of Cryocide20 disinfectant may be an effective option for reduction of low levels of infectious bacterial pathogens from contaminated environmental surfaces.
TI  - Mobile genetic elements and their contribution to the emergence of antimicrobial  resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) including plasmids and transposons are pivotal in  the dissemination and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Enterococcal MGEs have also been shown to be able to transfer resistance determinants to more pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus. Despite their importance, we have a limited knowledge about the prevalence, distribution and genetic content of specific MGEs in enterococcal populations. Molecular epidemiological studies of enterococcal MGEs have been hampered by the lack of standardized molecular typing methods and relevant genome information. This review focuses on recent developments in the detection of MGEs and their contribution to the spread of antimicrobial resistance in clinically relevant enterococci.
TI  - Dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in German intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: The study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 German ICUs from 2001 through 2008. Data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (AD) expressed as daily defined doses (DDD) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. RESULTS: Total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 DDD/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). Carbapenem use almost doubled to an AD of 151 in 2008. Significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (AD of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (AD of 117 in 2008). Aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (AD of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). Resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 26% and 20% (P = 0.006; trend test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (P = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3GC)-resistant Escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (P < 0.001), 3GC-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (P < 0.001), imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (P = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. The resistance densities did not change for MRSA but increased significantly for VRE faecium and 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. In 2008, the resistance density for MRSA was 3.73, 0.48 for VRE, 1.39 for 3GC-resistant E. coli and 0.82 for K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Although total antibiotic use did not change over time in German ICUs, carbapenem use doubled. This is probably due to the rise in 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Motualevic acids and analogs: synthesis and antimicrobial structure-activity relationships.
AB  - Synthesis of the marine natural products motualevic acids A, E, and analogs in which modifications have been made to the omega-brominated lipid (E)-14,14-dibromotetra-deca-2,13-dienoic acid or amino acid unit are reported, together with antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
TI  - Chrysophaentins A-H, antibacterial bisdiarylbutene macrocycles that inhibit the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ.
AB  - Eight new antimicrobial natural products named chrysophaentins A-H belonging to a new structural class have been isolated from the marine chrysophyte alga Chrysophaeum taylori. Their structures were determined by extensive 2D NMR and MS techniques and are characterized by the presence of two polyhalogenated, polyoxygenated omega,omega'-diarylbutene units connected by two ether bonds to form the suite of macrocyclic natural products. Chrysophaentin A, the most potent of these antibiotics, inhibited the growth of clinically relevant Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(50) 1.5 +/- 0.7 microg/mL), multidrug-resistant S. aureus (1.3 +/- 0.4 microg/mL), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50) 2.9 +/- 0.8 microg/mL). In vitro enzyme assays and transmission electron microscopy showed chrysophaentin A to inhibit the GTPase activity of the bacterial cytoskeletal protein FtsZ with an IC(50) value of 6.7 +/- 1.7 microg/mL, as well as GTP-induced formation of FtsZ protofilaments. Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR experiments further confirmed chrysophaentin A binds to FtsZ, and NMR competition experiments with GTPgammaS showed chrysophaentin A and GTP to bind competitively to FtsZ. Last, molecular docking simulations provided a low energy model in which chrysophaentin A binds in and occludes a large portion of the GTP binding site of FtsZ in a manner that is consistent with the binding epitope determined by STD NMR.
TI  - Rapid analysis of Gram-positive bacteria in water via membrane filtration coupled with nanoprobe-based MALDI-MS.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) is challenging when it is directly applied to identify bacteria in water. This study demonstrates a rapid, sensitive, and selective technique for detection of Gram-positive bacteria in water. It involves a combination of membrane filtration (MF) and vancomycin-conjugated magnetite nanoparticles (VNPs) to selectively separate and concentrate Gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water, followed by rapid analysis of the isolates using whole-cell MALDI-MS. VNPs specifically recognize cells of Gram-positive bacteria, which serves as a basis for affinity capture of target Gram-positive bacteria. A two-step procedure of surface modification of bare magnetite nanoparticles was applied to synthesize VNPs. MF prior to VNP-based magnetic separation can effectively increase the enrichment factor and detection sensitivity and reduce time-consuming culture steps and the matrix effect for analysis of bacteria in MALDI-MS. The enrichment factor for the MF-VNP technique is about 6 x 10(4). A variety of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecium, were successfully analyzed from aqueous solutions and their mixtures with Gram-negative bacteria. The optimal conditions of the VNP/MALDI-MS technique, including selection of the MALDI matrix, the choice of cell-washing solution, and the VNP concentration, were also investigated. The capture efficiencies of Gram-positive bacteria with VNPs were 26.7-33.3%. The mass variations of characteristic peaks of the captured bacteria were within +/-5 Da, which indicated good reproducibility of the proposed technique. The technique was applied to detect Gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water with an analysis time of around 2 h. The detection limit for Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus was 5 x 10(2) cfu/ml for 2.0-l water samples.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological spectrum of necrotizing fasciitis in surgical patients at a Philippine university medical centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study describes the clinical characteristics, bacteriology and risk factors for mortality of patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF), seen in a university medical centre. METHODS: The medical charts of NF patients admitted to the institution from January 2004 to July 2007 were retrieved and reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The majority of the 67 patients included in the study presented with localized nonspecific inflammatory manifestations: tenderness (94%), warmth (86%), oedema (76%), skin necrosis (75%), and ulceration (68%). Diabetes mellitus (22%) was the most common predisposing medical condition. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli (44%), Acinetobacter baumannii (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (15%) and Enterococcus faecium (15%). Overall mortality rate was 36%. Risk factors significantly associated with mortality were truncal involvement (p = 0.034), leukocytosis (p = 0.038), acidosis (p = 0.001), hypoalbuminaemia (p = 0.004), hypocalcaemia (p = 0.000) and hyponatraemia (p = 0.023). Logistic regression analysis revealed acidosis [p < 0.05, odds ratio (OR) = 9] and hypoalbuminaemia (p < 0.05, OR = 14) as significant independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The identified risk factors can inform clinicians of increased mortality risks for certain patients with NF. They should serve as a trigger for more aggressive surgical and critical care, and antimicrobial therapy for these patients.
TI  - Potent antimicrobial activity of 3-(4,5-diaryl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1H-indole derivatives against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - A new series of antimicrobial derivatives [3-(4,5-diaryl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1H-indole)] have been synthesized with potent activity against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA). Compound 17 [3-(4,5-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-5-bromo-1H-indole], the most active derivative was shown to inhibit the growth of all Gram-positive strains tested, including vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with no activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Exposure-response analysis of tigecycline in pharmacodynamic simulations using different size inocula of target bacteria.
AB  - This study explored tigecycline exposure-bacterial responses in pharmacodynamic simulations (in vitro kinetic model) using different inocula. One meticillin-resistant vancomycin-heteroresistant Staphylococcus aureus, one Enterococcus faecium and one extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli with equal tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations/minimum bactericidal concentrations (MICs/MBCs) (0.12/0.25 microg/mL) were used. A computerised pharmacodynamic bicompartmental model simulated three tigecycline twice-daily dosing regimens over 48h: 50mg (100mg loading dose); 100mg; and 150 mg. Areas under bacterial growth curves were calculated, and differences between the growth curve used as control and the killing curve of bacteria exposed to tigecycline (ABBC) were determined. With standard inocula [ca. 1 x 10(6)colony-forming units (CFU)/mL], linear increases in area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/MIC (25.6 for 50mg, 53.76 for 100mg and 79.52 for 150 mg) produced linear increases in activity against Gram-positive organisms (mean ABBCs of 120.60, 143.20 and 195.80 log CFU x h/mL for S. aureus and of 95.75, 172.55 and 216.90 log CFUxh/mL for E. faecium, respectively), with the activity of the 150 mg regimen being significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of the other two regimens. ABBCs obtained with the 100mg regimen using standard inocula were similar to those obtained with the 150 mg regimen when using high inocula (ca. 1 x 10(7)CFU/mL). Against E. coli, the highest dosing regimen was required to obtain significant antibacterial activity compared with control (mean ABBCs of 145.75 log CFU x h/mL with standard inocula and 63.33 log CFU x h/mL with high inocula). An increase in tigecycline dosing appears to be an interesting therapeutic option to maximise antibacterial activity owing to its linear pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, especially when severe infections with high bacterial load are suspected.
TI  - Effect of overnight storage of blood culture bottles on bacterial detection time  in the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Identifying the pathogens present in blood stream infections  is crucial to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoid morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of overnight storage of aerobic and anaerobic BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles on the detection time for common pathogens. METHODS: From November 2007 to July 2008, a total of 2,105 isolates were positively detected using the BACTEC 9240 system. The time to positive detection (TTD) was calculated by subtracting the time of receipt in the laboratory from the time required to detect a positive culture. The mean TTD values were calculated using the TTD value of the first positive culture bottle only. Overnight delay at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Taiwan was 15 hours (from 5 pm to 8 am). RESULTS: Of the 2,105 total isolates, 972 (46.1%) were Gram-positive bacteria, 1,024 (48.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria and 109 (5.1%) were fungi. Among the top 10 pathogens, 24.7% grew only in the aerobic bottle and 15.1% in the anaerobic bottle, including Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacteriaceae, and Gram-positive bacilli. Due to the overnight delay in loading a blood culture bottle into the instrument, for most of the pathogens (including Staphylococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae), a decrease in TTD by <or= 4.4 hours was observed. An increase in TTD by 20.8 hours was observed for Gram-positive bacilli. We also found that the difference between TTD in aerobic versus anaerobic bottles during the day was higher in coagulase-negative staphylococcus (12 hours) and lower in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (< 2 hours). TTD was longer than 72 hours in 20.5% of Gram-positive bacilli and 7.3% of Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: No difference in the TTD of major pathogens was observed in bottles processed during the day and after overnight delay, suggesting that the delayed entry of the blood culture bottle into the instrument may affect the detection time. Since high numbers of facultative anaerobes were detected in anaerobic bottles only, use of a single aerobic bottle might have a detrimental effect on the clinical therapy outcome.
TI  - [Investigation of the in vitro antibacterial effects of statins].
AB  - It was previously shown that statins have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-oxidant effects. This study was aimed to investigate the in-vitro antibacterial effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin. In this study antibacterial activity of the statins were tested against 16 methicillin-susceptible Stophylococcus aureus (MSSA), 16 methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA), 16 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCoNS), 9 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 7 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecolis, 13 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, 16 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Escherichia coli, 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 Acinetobacter boumannii, 15 ESBL positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Stenotrophomonas maltophilio by broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) performance and interpretive guidelines. S. aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 43300, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, K.pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and E. coli ATCC 35218 were tested as control strains. The results showed that minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for all isolates were > 128 microg/ml for the two statins tested. However, MIC of simvastatin was 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 and was 64 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and was > 128 microg/ml for others, but MIC of atorvastatin was > 128 microg/mI for all standard strains. According to these results, we observed that simvastatin and atorvastain had no significant antibacterial effect in vitro. In this study, although no antibacterial effect of statins were determined in vitro, further studies are needed to investigate the combined effect of statins with antibacterial agents in the living organism.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive cocci isolated from skin and skin-structure infections in European medical centres.
AB  - Skin and skin-structure infections (SSSIs) usually involve Gram-positive organisms. Prompt initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment is essential for achieving a favourable outcome in severe cases. Empirical antibacterial therapy should be based on several considerations, including patient risk factors, expected pathogens and local/regional susceptibility profiles, among others. In the present study, we evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with SSSIs hospitalised in European medical centres. A total of 3573 bacterial isolates were collected from 33 medical centres located in 13 European countries as well as Israel over a 6-year period (2003-2008) and were tested for susceptibility to daptomycin and other comparator agents by reference broth microdilution methods in a central laboratory. The most frequently isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (71.1%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (10.5%) and enterococci (9.3%). Overall, rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were 22.5% and 5.1%, respectively, but with great intercountry variation. The overall MRSA rate varied slightly during the study period, but with no overall tendency toward increase or decrease, whilst the overall VRE rate consistently increased from 1.5% in 2003 to 11.0% in 2008. Daptomycin and linezolid were the most active agents tested overall. All isolates monitored were considered susceptible to daptomycin, and only one isolate (Enterococcus faecium) was categorised as non-susceptible to linezolid. In conclusion, the results of this contemporary surveillance study indicate that daptomycin and linezolid retain sustained in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci isolated from patients hospitalised with SSSI in numerous European medical centres.
TI  - Evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  - A semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (EP) substrate ethidium  bromide (EB) is described for the assessment of EP systems of bacteria. The method employs the Rotor-Gene(TM) 3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of EB in Phosphate-Buffered Solution (PBS) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, pH, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (EPIs). The method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic EP systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of EP-mediated multi-drug resistance (MDR). The method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed EP systems of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism can be maintained in PBS, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its EP system.
TI  - [Interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to the expression of the mecA gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. For macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins B, (MLS(B)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vanA isolates). In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to MLS(B) in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parC/parE (low level) and in gyrA. It is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in Spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vanA enterococci and case reports due to vanB2 enterococci have been recently reported.
TI  - Expression of beta-defensin-3 in lungs of immunocompetent rats with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the rising incidence and high rate of treatment failure of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), to date there has been no rat model specifically designed for antimicrobial evaluation. beta-Defensin-3 Acronym for beta-defensin-3 is correct as (BD-3) is an antimicrobial peptide and mainly expresses in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. It demonstrates a broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity against many potentially pathogenic microbes, including multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that the expression of BD-3 might change in lungs of rats with MRSA VAP, and this change might play an important role in the pathogenesis of VAP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty specific pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the following experimental groups: (1) N (nonventilated pneumonia) group (n=34): rats were infected intrabronchially with 0.2 mL of 10(10) cfu/mL MRSA inoculum; (2)V (ventilator-associated pneumonia) group (n=34): rats were ventilated for 4 h using the protective ventilation settings: 6 mL/kg tidal volume, 5 cm H(2)O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), 88 breaths/min, and F(i)O(2)=0.21. After ventilation, rats were inoculated intrabronchially with the same amount of MRSA as in N group; (3) P (protective mechanical ventilation) group (n=6): 0.2 mL of normal saline was instilled into lungs of rats after 4 h of ventilation as in V group; (4) C (control) group (n=6): only 0.2 mL of normal saline were instilled into lungs of rats. Rats from both P and C groups were killed 48 h after instillation of normal saline. Rats from other two groups were killed 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 h after inoculation. Pneumonia evaluation was performed by macroscopic, histopathologic, and microbiologic criteria. The expression of BD-3 in lungs was determined by immunohistochemistry staining and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Rats inoculated after 4 h of protective mechanical ventilation rapidly developed progressive pneumonia with heterogeneous distribution of lesions and different degrees of histologic evolution predominating in lower lobes. Lung bacterial concentrations in V group at each time point were significantly higher than those of N group. It was 12.2+/-0.9log(10) cfu/g of tissue at h 48 in V group, and 8.7+/-0.4 in N group. Bacteremia occurred in nine of 10 rats at h 48 in V group, while two of 10 rats in N group. Both C and P groups showed a very low level of BD-3. Compared with C group, the expression of BD-3 at h 48 in both N and V groups significantly increased. However, the latter was significantly lower than the former. CONCLUSIONS: Rat model of MRSA VAP was obtained by intrabronchially inoculating rats with 2x10(9) cfu MRSA after 4h of protective mechanical ventilation. VAP was more severe than nonventilated pneumonia in terms of histopathologic and microbiologic criteria, especially systemic spread. This may be associated with the inhibited up-regulation of BD-3 expression by mechanical ventilation.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the bioactive compound beauvericin produced by Fusarium proliferatum on solid medium of wheat.
AB  - To obtain the bioactive compound beauvericin (BEA), Fusarium proliferatum CECT 20569 was grown on a solid medium of wheat, utilizing the technique of the solid state fermentation (SSF), being this mycotoxin purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse phase semi-preparative column using as the mobile phase acetonitrile/water in gradient condition. The purity of the BEA was verified by analytical HPLC and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The pure fractions of BEA were utilized to determinate the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract as: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - Synthetic studies toward the mannopeptimycins: synthesis of orthogonally protected beta-hydroxyenduracididines.
AB  - The asymmetric synthesis of the nonproteinogenic amino acids (2S,3S,4'S)-beta-hydroxyenduracididine 3 and (2R,3S,4'S)-beta-hydroxyenduracididine 4 in orthogonally protected form in 15 total steps from Garner's aldehyde is reported. The former and N-glycosylated form of the latter are found in the glycopeptide antibiotic mannopeptimycin.
TI  - How honey kills bacteria.
AB  - With the rise in prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, honey is increasingly valued for its antibacterial activity. To characterize all bactericidal factors in a medical-grade honey, we used a novel approach of successive neutralization of individual honey bactericidal factors. All bacteria tested, including Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli, ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, were killed by 10-20% (v/v) honey, whereas > or = 40% (v/v) of a honey-equivalent sugar solution was required for similar activity. Honey accumulated up to 5.62 +/- 0.54 mM H(2)O(2) and contained 0.25 +/- 0.01 mM methylglyoxal (MGO). After enzymatic neutralization of these two compounds, honey retained substantial activity. Using B. subtilis for activity-guided isolation of the additional antimicrobial factors, we discovered bee defensin-1 in honey. After combined neutralization of H(2)O(2), MGO, and bee defensin-1, 20% honey had only minimal activity left, and subsequent adjustment of the pH of this honey from 3.3 to 7.0 reduced the activity to that of sugar alone. Activity against all other bacteria tested depended on sugar, H(2)O(2), MGO, and bee defensin-1. Thus, we fully characterized the antibacterial activity of medical-grade honey.
TI  - Synergistic effects between conventional antibiotics and 2-aminoimidazole-derived antibiofilm agents.
AB  - 2-aminoimidazoles are an emerging class of small molecules that possess the ability to inhibit and disperse biofilms across bacterial order, class, and phylum. Herein, we report the synergistic effect between a 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate and antibiotics toward dispersing preestablished biofilms, culminating with a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase of biofilm dispersion toward Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, we document that the 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate will also resensitize multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria to the effects of conventional antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - In vitro prevention of the emergence of daptomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci following combination with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin.
AB  - Daptomycin is bactericidal against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate-resistant S. aureus (GISA) and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. However, selection for daptomycin-resistant derivatives has occasionally been reported during therapy in humans. Here we evaluate whether selection for daptomycin-resistant S. aureus or enterococci could be prevented in vitro by combining daptomycin with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, gentamicin or rifampicin. Six strains of S. aureus (four MRSA and two GISA) and four strains of enterococci (two Enterococcus faecalis and two Enterococcus faecium) were serially exposed in broth to two-fold stepwise increasing concentrations of daptomycin alone or in combination with a fixed concentration [0.25x minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)] of either of the second agents. The daptomycin MIC was examined after each cycle. Exposure to daptomycin alone gradually selected for S. aureus and enterococci with an increased MIC. Gentamicin did not prevent the emergence of daptomycin-resistant bacteria. Rifampicin was also unable to prevent daptomycin resistance, although resistance was slightly delayed. In contrast, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin prevented or greatly delayed the selection of daptomycin-resistant mutants in S. aureus and enterococci, respectively. Addition of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin to daptomycin prevents, or greatly delays, daptomycin resistance in vitro. Future studies in animal models are needed to predict the utility of these combinations in humans.
TI  - Bioactive bromophycolides R-U from the Fijian red alga Callophycus serratus.
AB  - Four new bromophycolides, R-U (1-4), were isolated from the Fijian red alga Callophycus serratus and were identified by 1D and 2D NMR and mass spectroscopic analyses. These compounds expand the known structural variety of diterpene-benzoate macrolides and exhibited modest cytotoxicity toward selected human cancer cell lines. Bromophycolide S (2) also showed submicromolar activity against the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
TI  - NXL-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and MRSA.
AB  - Novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin NXL-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. NXL-103 is a combination of streptogramin A:streptogramin B components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. In multiple in vitro studies, NXL-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. NXL-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. In phase I clinical trials, NXL-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. The first phase II trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NXL-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. NXL-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.
TI  - [Evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  - Over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. The rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. The antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. In fact in a recent estimate of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about 90.000 deaths per year in the USA are attributable to bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. It appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria. The antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. Among the Gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant Corynebacterium. The CoNS, eg. S. epidermidis, S. hominis and S. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more than 60%) and multiresistant. The unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. Among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin, but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility to linezolid in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus strains].
AB  - There has been a dramatic increase in the number of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) worldwide. Linezolid which is one of the first oxazolidinones in clinical use, has bacteriostatic activity on gram-positive bacteria including MRSA and VRE. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities of MRSA and VRE clinical isolates to linezolid. A total of 100 MRSA strains isolated from clinical specimens as infectious agents (96 blood, 2 pleural fluid, 1 peritoneal fluid, 1 joint fluid isolates), and 101 VRE (Enterococcus faecium) strains isolated from clinical specimens as colonizing or infectious agents (79 rectal swabs, 11 blood, 3 catheter, 3 peritoneal fluid, 3 urine, 2 wound isolates) in Microbiology Laboratory of Uludag University Medical Faculty Hospital, Turkey, were included to the study. In vitro linezolid activity has been searched by E-test method and all of the isolates were found susceptible to linezolid. Linezolid minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranged for MRSA and VRE between 0.25-3 microg/mL and 0.25-2 microg/mL, respectively. Linezolid MIC50 and MIC90 values for MRSA were 1.5 microg/mL and 2 microg/mL, respectively, while for VRE these values were 0.75 microg/mL and 1.5 microg/mL, respectively. Our results were in parallel with the data of other national and international studies, emphasizing that linezolid is a new and effective choice in treatment of infections caused by resistant gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  - The discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. These discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. However, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. Today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. Infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. In this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.
TI  - Challenges in anti-infective development in the era of bad bugs, no drugs: a regulatory perspective using the example of bloodstream infection as an indication.
AB  - Bloodstream infections present many challenges to clinicians. The number of hospitalized patients with bloodstream infection continues to increase, and the number of newly available antimicrobial agents to treat these particularly lethal infections and many other serious infections continues to decrease. Drug-development programs for bloodstream infection that have adhered to existing regulatory guidelines have not been significantly successful. This article examines the regulatory history of the bloodstream infection indication as an example of the challenges faced by individuals and sponsors developing drugs for treatment of the current spectrum of antimicrobial-resistant infections, with the goal of providing insight into development pathways for agents targeting drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Disease-specific and pathogen-specific indications are discussed, and recent regulatory approvals for bloodstream infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are reviewed.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological screening of 2-aminoimidazole-based bacterial and fungal antibiofilm agents.
AB  - A collection of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole amides has been synthesized and screened for antibiofilm activity. This class of small molecules was found to modulate the biofilm activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio vulnificus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as well as the yeast Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, lead compounds were found to not lyse red blood cells at active concentrations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus Faecium Fair-E 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus faecium FAIR-E 198 against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by E. faecium FAIR-E 198 inhibited all L. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 AU mL(-1)). However, none of the B. cereus and S. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. The maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 AU mL(-1)) was observed in MRS broth, while the activity in milk was 100 AU mL(-1). In the co-cultivation test in milk, B. cereus K1-B041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log CFU mL(-1)) after 48 h. E. faecium reduced the initial L. monocytogenes Scott A population by 1 log CFU mL(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees C, However, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log CFU mL(-1) after 48 h. E. faecium did not influence the growth of S. aureus ATCC 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, Therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of E. faecium FAIR-E 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - Evaluation of risk factors for coinfection or cocolonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We retrospectively evaluated 410 patients with coinfection or cocolonization due  to vancomycin-resistant (VR) enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The prevalence rate was 19.8%. Risk factors included isolation of VR Enterococcus faecalis and use of linezolid or clindamycin. Inc18-like vanA plasmids were found in 7% of VR E. faecalis isolates and none of the VR E. faecium isolates.
TI  - New antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  - The optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. We herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. The newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.
TI  - Early appropriate therapy of Gram-positive bloodstream infections: the conservative use of new drugs.
AB  - Among the Gram-positive organisms, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium represent the biggest therapeutic hurdles. The evolution of MRSA exemplifies the genetic adaptation of an organism into a first-class multidrug-resistant pathogen. Glycopeptides such as vancomycin have been the treatment of choice for MRSA, but poor outcomes have frequently been reported, particularly among isolates with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) within the susceptible range (< or =2 mg/L). Further more, vancomycin's limitations as an antibacterial agent include slow bactericidal activity and relatively poor tissue penetration. Inadequate dosing may, however, contribute to vancomycin's poor performance; the standard recommendation for trough concentrations of 5-10 mg/L is inadequate for serious infections such as bacteraemia and endocarditis. Trough levels of 15-20 mg/L are probably necessary; however they are often associated with increased nephrotoxicity. Despite the recent dramatic reduction in antibiotic research by pharmaceutical companies, a few compounds have been developed to treat Gram-positive infections. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, although shown to have in vitro activity against MRSA, is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MRSA, and cannot be recommended for the treatment of S. aureus bacteraemia, except under exceptional circumstances. Although linezolid and tigecycline may be useful in specific situations, they cannot be routinely recommended for the treatment of MRSA bacteraemia because of safety concerns and very limited available clinical data. Daptomycin has recently been proven to be effective and well tolerated for meticillin-sensitive S. aureus and MRSA bacteraemia, including right-sided endocarditis.
TI  - Risk factors and management of Gram-positive bacteraemia.
AB  - The incidence of Gram-positive bloodstream infections has been increasing steadily. The virulence of coagulase-negative staphylococci is based mainly on their ability to produce biofilms, and thus cause infections of intravascular devices and foreign bodies, which must be removed to resolve the infection. Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of endocarditis, and it is important to recognize patients at risk of the complications of S. aureus bloodstream infections. The rate of meticillin resistance is higher in healthcare-related infections, although clones of community-acquired meticillin-resistant S. aureus carrying the Panton-Valentine leukocidin have recently emerged. Vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) creep gives cause for concern, and MICs >1 microg/mL are associated with higher failure rates and mortality in patients with S. aureus bacteraemia treated with vancomycin. Daptomycin should be considered the optimal empirical treatment for S. aureus bloodstream infections in settings with medium to high prevalence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. Enterococci are the third leading cause of Gram-positive bacteraemia in our institution. Management of this disease is difficult because of its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, mainly in Enterococcus faecium infections. The recently described synergism of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is a good therapeutic option for Enterococcus faecalis bacteraemia and endocarditis caused by high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains.
TI  - Significance of infection markers and microbiological findings during tissue processing of cryopreserved arterial homografts for the early postoperative course.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate homograft implantation for the urgent treatment of vascular infections on the basis of the course of infection using microbiological findings in perioperatively obtained specimens and during homograft processing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 85 patients were treated with cryopreserved homografts from 2004-2007. The microbiological findings of the decontamination process of homografts in the tissue bank were evaluated. The perioperative infection profile (microorganisms, CRP, leukocytes, body temperature) of the patients was analysed. RESULTS: Complete microbiological and clinical follow-up for the postoperative course was available for 35 patients, who were treated with homografts from the same tissue bank and finally included into this study. 55 cryopreserved homografts were implanted. 35/55 (64%) homografts were positive for microorganisms before decontamination. 3/35 (9%) homografts remained positive after the decontamination. 33 patients were operated for prosthetic graft infection and 2 for an infiltration of a large vessel from neighbouring malignant disease. The most common infection agent was Staphylococcus aureus. Thirty-day mortality was 20% (7/35). Only in 4/35 (11%) patients were the microorganisms of the intraoperative swabs also detected during the postoperative course. The microorganisms were ORSA, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Burkholderia cepacia. The patient with ORSA infection died on POD 11 from multiple organ failure and all other patients recovered. None of the postoperative swabs showed the homograft predecontamination microorganisms. Interestingly, a significant association (P = 0.003) between C-reactive protein increase two weeks after surgery and donor-recipient ABO mismatch was found. CONCLUSIONS: The implantation of homografts following the established decontamination is an alternative urgent therapeutic option in vascular infections with encouraging outcomes. The absence of the predecontamination focus in the postoperative specimens of patients, suggests that the postoperative course and outcomes show no strong relation to potential homograft contamination prior to the decontamination process.
TI  - Presence of pathogens and indicator microbes at a non-point source subtropical recreational marine beach.
AB  - Swimming in ocean water, including ocean water at beaches not impacted by known point sources of pollution, is an increasing health concern. This study was an initial evaluation of the presence of indicator microbes and pathogens and the association among the indicator microbes, pathogens, and environmental conditions at a subtropical, recreational marine beach in south Florida impacted by non-point sources of pollution. Twelve water and eight sand samples were collected during four sampling events at high or low tide under elevated or reduced solar insolation conditions. The analyses performed included analyses of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens), human-associated microbial source tracking (MST) markers (human polyomaviruses [HPyVs] and Enterococcus faecium esp gene), and pathogens (Vibrio vulnificus, Staphylococcus aureus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp.). The enterococcus concentrations in water and sand determined by quantitative PCR were greater than the concentrations determined by membrane filtration measurement. The FIB concentrations in water were below the recreational water quality standards for three of the four sampling events, when pathogens and MST markers were also generally undetectable. The FIB levels exceeded regulatory guidelines during one event, and this was accompanied by detection of HPyVs and pathogens, including detection of the autochthonous bacterium V. vulnificus in sand and water, detection of the allochthonous protozoans Giardia spp. in water, and detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in sand samples. The elevated microbial levels were detected at high tide and under low-solar-insolation conditions. Additional sampling should be conducted to further explore the relationships between tidal and solar insolation conditions and between indicator microbes and pathogens in subtropical recreational marine waters impacted by non-point source pollution.
TI  - [Update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  - There is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics in clinical practice. As observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. For instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. Over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. In fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium). Therefore, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. Even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for Gram-positive infections. This review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in France (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).
TI  - Benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors as potential antimicrobial agents with activity against enterococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of three members of a benzoxazine series of histidine kinase inhibitors ( 4a , 4b and 6 ) was studied on standard strains, and with 4b also on clinical isolates of enterococci. METHODS: Susceptibility to each compound was tested using a broth macrodilution method with a range of dilutions from 0.016 to 128 microg/ml on four standard strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212) and in the case of 4b also on 52 clinical isolates of enterococci (7 vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis, 15 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium and 30 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium), and on two additional standard strains (S. aureus ATCC 43300 and E. faecalis ATCC 51299). RESULTS: Neither of the compounds inhibited the growth of E. coli ATCC 25922 or P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Compound 4b inhibited the growth of S. aureus ATCC 29213 at 8 microg/ml, S. aureus ATCC 43300 at 32 microg/ml, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, and E. faecalis ATCC 51299 at 16 microg/ml, while 4a and 6 did so at higher concentrations. For clinical isolates of enterococci, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of 4b were in the range of 0.5-16 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Compound 4b promises to be a potentially useful antimicrobial agent for vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci.
TI  - Update on the in vitro activity of daptomycin tested against 17,193 Gram-positive bacteria isolated from European medical centers (2005-2007).
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 17,193 Gram-positive isolates consecutively collected from 28 medical centers in 12 countries in europe and israel in 2005-2007 were evaluated by Clinical and laboratory Standards institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methods supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/l for testing daptomycin. Overall, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 28.3%, varying from 32.3% in 2005 to 27.1% in 2006 and 28.5% in 2007. Vancomycin resistance rates were 0.8% and 21.5% among Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, respectively. Among E. faecium, vancomycin resistance increased from 17.9% in 2005 to 26.3% in 2007, and varied from 0.0% in Spain, Sweden and Switzerland to as high as 54.6% in ireland for 2007. All isolates tested, except for seven CoNS (0.2%; 3,234 tested) were considered susceptible to daptomycin using breakpoints established by the United States food and Drug Administration, the CLSI and the EUCAST. Daptomycin was very active against all Gram-positive species with the highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results being 1, 4, 2 and 4 mg/l for S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively. Daptomycin activity was not adversely influenced by resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci or to vancomycin among enterococci.
TI  - Interaction of ceftobiprole with the low-affinity PBP 5 of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a new cephalosporin that exhibits a high level of affinity for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus PBP 2a. It was reported that ceftobiprole did not interact with a mutated form of the low-affinity protein Enterococcus faecium PBP 5 (PBP 5fm) that, when overexpressed, confers a beta-lactam resistance phenotype to the bacterium. Our results show that ceftobiprole binds to unmutated PBP 5fm to form a stable acyl-enzyme and that ceftobiprole is able to efficiently kill a penicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain that produces this protein.
TI  - Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  - The seventh year of the Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against Gram-positive pathogens in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various Gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. Each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the United Kingdom, Japan, and China where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: S. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (748), enterococci (864), Streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). Eight linezolid-resistant (LZD-R) isolates were detected in 7 countries (Italy [2], France, China, Brazil, Sweden, Germany, and United Kingdom) among the enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis [3] and E. faecium [2]) and CoNS (3 Staphylococcus epidermidis). Five LZD-R isolates contained 23S rRNA mutations (G2576T or G2447T), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. One CoNS (Italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in Taiwan. All streptococci were linezolid susceptible (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL). In conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. Documented LZD-R remains rare (only 0.13% overall but highest for CoNS [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. Rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of MRSA varied by geographic region and between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.
TI  - Linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (LEADER Program for 2008).
AB  - The LEADER Program was initiated in 2004 and monitors emerging linezolid resistance in sampled US medical centers. This report summarizes the data obtained in 2008, the 5th consecutive year. A total of 57 institutions participated in 2008 representing all 9 US census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6113 isolates, 101.9% compliance to protocol design). The organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were Staphylococcus aureus (3156), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 856), enterococci (901), Streptococcus pneumoniae (619), and viridans group (223) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (358); also, D-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with MIC(90) results ranging from 1 microg/mL (streptococci and CoNS) to 2 microg/mL (Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci). Only 0.36% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, a slight decrease from 0.45% and 0.44% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The nonsusceptible strains (22) were Staphylococcus aureus (3), CoNS (14), and Enterococcus faecium (5) each with defined target mutations (G2576T in 19 strains; T2504A in 1 strain), mobile cfr element (1 strain Staphylococcus epidermidis with an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern to a cfr-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the same center in LEADER 2007), or an unknown (1 strain) mechanism. The mobile cfr resistance found in a Staphylococcus aureus strain in 2007 was not observed in 2008. In conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 5th year of this LEADER Program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.64% susceptibility levels). The nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable and the plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism that emerged in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in 2007 showed no evidence of dissemination or increased prevalence. However, there was evidence of cfr persistence with the S. epidermidis strain. The LEADER Program continues to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect and monitor novel oxazolidinone resistance phenotypes and genotypes.
TI  - Impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. METHODS: In January 2004, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (ICU). Prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) drainage. The effect on the antibiotic use density (AD: DDD [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (January 2002-December 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(January 2004-December 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. Resistance proportions(RP) and resistance densities (RD), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis or E. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3GC) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the Fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Total antibiotic use by 147 DDD/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 DDD/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887DDD/1,000 pd post-intervention. This decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. The reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. The RR and RD of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli increased after January 2004, whereas the percentage of MRSA significantly decreased. CONCLUSION: Change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. It would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical ICUs may be very worthwhile.
TI  - Multiplex PCR-ligation detection reaction assay for simultaneous detection of drug resistance and toxin genes from Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - A multiplex PCR-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) assay was developed for rapid detection of methicillin, tetracycline, and vancomycin resistance, as well as toxic shock toxin and Panton-Valentine leukocidin. The assay was tested on 470 positive blood culture bottles containing Staphylococcus aureus or enterococci. PCR-LDR exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of > or = 98% for all components except tetracycline resistance, which had a sensitivity of 94.7%. Rapid and sensitive detection of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes could help guide therapy and appropriate infection control measures.
TI  - Norselic acids A-E, highly oxidized anti-infective steroids that deter mesograzer predation, from the Antarctic sponge Crella sp.
AB  - Five new steroids, norselic acids A-E (1-5), were isolated from the sponge Crella sp. collected in Antarctica. The planar structures of the norselic acids were established by extensive NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry studies, and the configuration of norselic acid A (1) was elucidated by X-ray crystallography. Norselic acid A displays antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), and Candida albicans and reduces consumption of food pellets by sympatric mesograzers. Compounds 1-5 are also active against the Leishmania parasite at low micromolar levels.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial properties of (-)-nor-platencin.
AB  - An asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction between acrolein and 1-benzyloxymethyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene affords a bicyclic aldehyde that was elaborated in 11 steps to nor-platencin. nor-Platencin is 4-16 times less active than platencin against several resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, macrolide-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - In vitro effect of physiological concentrations of human albumin on the antibacterial activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine C(max) tigecycline activity in the presence/absence of physiological concentrations of human albumin with free fraction concentrations as controls. METHODS: Killing curves (final inoculum: 1.0-5.0 x 10(7) cfu/mL) were performed with 0.88 mg/L final concentrations (serum C(max) after a 100 mg 1 h infusion) in Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) (MH) and in MH with 4 g/dL human albumin. Controls were curves in MH with concentrations similar to the free fraction (fC(max) = 0.17 mg/L) calculated using protein binding. Activity was measured as log(10) initial inoculum reduction (log(10) initial inoculum-log(10) at 12 h/24 h). Target strains (tigecycline MIC/MBC; mg/L) were: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus heteroresistant to vancomycin (0.12/0.25); Enterococcus faecium (0.12/0.25); Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (0.12/0.25); and Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/1). RESULTS: At 24 h the fC(max) produced mean decreases of < or =0.1 cfu/mL for all strains, in contrast to the bactericidal activity (mean >3 log(10) reduction) provided by C(max) concentrations in the presence or absence of albumin for E. coli and E. faecium, and an activity nearly bactericidal for S. aureus (mean approximately 2.8 log(10) reduction). In the case of the A. baumannii isolate the C(max) in the presence or absence of albumin produced a mean reduction of 2.56 log(10) cfu/mL at 12 h (time of one dosing interval), with a bacteriostatic profile when considering 24 h colony counts (similar counts at 0 and 24 h). CONCLUSIONS: Correcting the total concentration for the reported literature binding values is unreliable since tigecycline antibacterial activity was greater than that suggested by the free fraction of the drug.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel non-fluorinated quinolone,  against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes in Taiwan.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activities of nemonoxacin against Gram-positive cocci with various resistance phenotypes. METHODS: MICs of nemonoxacin were determined for 798 recently collected (2005-07) and non-duplicate isolates of Gram-positive cocci by the agar dilution method. These isolates included: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 100); methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), including ciprofloxacin-susceptible (n = 50), ciprofloxacin-resistant (n = 100), vancomycin-intermediate (n = 50) and daptomycin-non-susceptible (DNS-MRSA; n = 5) isolates, and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA; n = 101); invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 150); levofloxacin-non-susceptible (MICs of 4-64 mg/L) S. pneumoniae isolates (n = 30); and enterococci (n = 212), including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; n = 112). RESULTS: Nemonoxacin had potent activity against MSSA (MIC(90) of < or =0.03 mg/L), ciprofloxacin-susceptible MRSA (MIC(90) of < or =0.03 mg/L) and CA-MRSA (MIC(90) of 0.06 mg/L). For all invasive S. pneumoniae isolates, the activity of nemonoxacin (MIC(90) of 0.06 mg/L) was similar to that of gemifloxacin and much better than that of levofloxacin (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L) and moxifloxacin (MIC(90) of 0.25 mg/L). Nemonoxacin had a 32- to 64-fold higher activity than levofloxacin against levofloxacin-non-susceptible isolates. Nemonoxacin exerted limited activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA (MIC(90) of 1 mg/L), vancomycin-intermediate MRSA (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L), DNS-MRSA (MIC(90) of 1 mg/L), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis and 4 mg/L for Enterococcus faecium) and VRE (MIC(90) of 4 mg/L for E. faecalis and 16 mg/L for E. faecium). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a potentially useful role for nemonoxacin in the treatment of infections caused by MSSA, ciprofloxacin-susceptible MRSA and S. pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Total syntheses of (+/-)-platencin and (-)-platencin.
AB  - The secondary metabolites platensimycin and platencin, isolated from the bacterial strain Streptomyces platensis, represent a novel class of natural products exhibiting unique and potent antibacterial activity. Platencin, though structurally similar to platensimycin, has been found to operate through a slightly different mechanism of action involving the dual inhibition of lipid elongation enzymes FabF and FabH. Both natural products exhibit strong, broad-spectrum, gram-positive antibacterial activity to key antibiotic resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Described herein are our synthetic efforts toward platencin, culminating in both racemic and asymmetric preparation of the natural product. The syntheses demonstrate the power of the cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction and the one-pot reductive rearrangement of [3.2.1] bicyclic ketones to [2.2.2] bicyclic olefins.
TI  - Is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. Approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. These exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. The association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study during 24 months. SETTING: Eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. PATIENTS: All inpatients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary isolates of six indicator organisms (Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant S. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. Indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. Surveillance of nosocomial infection rates was performed according to the German nosocomial infection surveillance system, Krankenhaus Infektions Surveillance System. Transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate Spearman's rank-correlation test. During 100,781 patient days, 100,829 microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. Altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6 transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. Correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration of hospitalization, or device use. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. Other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.
TI  - Microbiology of drugs for treating multiply drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Several new antimicrobials demonstrate in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and other Gram-positive bacteria. Data from large surveys indicate that linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline are almost universally active against MRSA. Linezolid and tigecycline inhibit both Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis at low concentrations; daptomycin is somewhat more potent against the latter. The investigational agents dalbavancin and telavancin are more potent than vancomycin against vancomycin-susceptible organisms. Dalbavancin inhibits vanB type VRE at low concentrations, but is not active against vanA type VRE. Telavancin is less active against VRE than against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, but minimum inhibitory concentrations are lower than those of vancomycin against VRE. With continued careful use of available antimicrobials, the vast majority of these organisms should remain susceptible to 1 or more of the agents discussed for the foreseeable future.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates associated with skin and soft tissue infections: first results from India.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin and selected comparator agents against Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with skin and soft tissue infection's was evaluated by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method. Daptomycin was the most active agent against both S. aureus (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL; 100% susceptible) and VREF (MIC(90), 4 microg/mL; 100% susceptible), making it an excellent therapeutic option.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from US medical centers: results of the Daptomycin Surveillance Program (2007-2008).
AB  - Gram-positive bacterial strains (12 443) consecutively collected during 2007 to 2008 in hospitals located in the United States were tested by reference broth microdilution methods against daptomycin and comparison agents. Methicillin (oxacillin) resistance rates were 55.9% and 74.0% for Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively, and the vancomycin resistance rate among Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 5.4% and 75.4%, respectively. Daptomycin was very active against all Gram-positive species with MIC(90) values of 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, and 2 microg/mL for staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, respectively. Overall, 99.9% of S. aureus, 100.0% of E. faecalis, and 99.5% of E. faecium were susceptible to daptomycin. In addition, daptomycin MIC distributions for S. aureus and enterococci from 2007 to 2008 were very similar to those from 2002 to 2003. In summary, high rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were observed in US hospitals, but daptomycin remains active against these clinically important Gram-positive organisms with no evidence of potency loss since its approval for clinical use in late 2003.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Lost in translation: differences in antimicrobial indication approval policies between the United States and Europe.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobials, like all drug products, are approved in the United States through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in the European Union partly through the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). This article investigates the differences in approved indications between these 2 bodies for a series of antimicrobial agents approved during the past decade. METHODS: The antimicrobial compounds most recently approved for specific indications by both the FDA and EMEA were included in the study. Indications were recorded from the respective Web sites and compared. Differences in approved indications were considered major if one regulatory body approved an agent for treatment of a specific condition while the other did not, or if one regulatory body approved an agent only for prophylaxis while the other approved it also for treatment. Differences were considered minor when the 2 bodies approved an antimicrobial for the same condition or pathogen but with different details regarding specific clinical situations. RESULTS: Thirteen antimicrobial compounds approved by both the FDA and EMEA were included in the study, namely anidulafungin, caspofungin, dapto-mycin, doripenem, ertapenem, linezolid, micafungin, posaconazole, quinupristin/dalfopristin, retapamulin, telithromycin, tigecycline, and voriconazole. Among these 13 agents, differences in approved indications between the United States and Europe were found to be major for 6 and minor for 6. Approved indications were the same for only 1 agent. Major differences were noted for doripenem, linezolid, micafungin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, posaconazole, and telithro-mycin. Examples of major differences include the following: linezolid has a US indication for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, but no similar indication in Europe; micafungin is indicated for pediatric use in Europe but not in the United States; and use of posaconazole is primarily therapeutic in Europe but preventive in the United States. Minor differences were noted for anidulafungin, caspofungin, daptomycin, ertapenem, retapamulin, and voriconazole. As an example of a minor difference, daptomycin has different indications for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Tigecycline was the only agent for which the FDA and EMEA had approved identical indications. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the indications for most antimicrobial agents were found between the United States and Europe. Because any approved indication can be viewed as scientific evidence, these differences may raise legal issues regarding the treatment of specific entities. To minimize these differences, coordination is needed between the FDA and EMEA regarding the procedures for approving indications.
TI  - New antimicrobial agents for use in the intensive care unit.
AB  - Timely provision of adequate antimicrobial coverage in an initial anti-infective  treatment regimen results in optimal outcomes for bacterial and fungal infections. However, selection of appropriate antimicrobial regimens for treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging due to expansion of resistance, which typically requires use of multidrug anti-infective regimens to provide adequate coverage of important pathogens commonly seen in the ICU setting. Indeed, a recent additional call to action by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has enforced the impact that antimicrobial-resistant pathogens can have on patient care. The term ESKAPE has been coined by this IDSA group to refer to Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, the etiologic causes of the majority of hospital-acquired infections in the United States that are able to effectively "escape" our antibiotic arsenal and that also mandate discovery of new antimicrobial agents. This article reviews select antibacterial agents and an antifungal agent in late stages of clinical development that appear to have potential for treatment of infections in the ICU.
TI  - Aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. Here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against HeLa cells. Preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.
TI  - [In vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against 499 strains of gram-positive cocci causing bloodstream infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, ceftobiprole and linezolid against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram-positive cocci. METHODS: Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of daptomycin with microbrothdilution method and the MICs of other 9 antimicrobial agents with agar dilution method against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram positive cocci was carried out. The data was analyzed with WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: The susceptibility rates of staphylococci to daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid, ceftobiprole, vancomycin and teicoplanin were 100%. All staphylococcus strains were inhibited by daptomycin at a MIC of 1 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 0.5 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (MRSCoN). Among Enterococcus spp, the highest MIC of daptomycin was 4 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 2 mg/L against E.faecalis, whereas they were 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L against E.faecium. One strains of linezolid-resistant E.faecalis (MIC: 8 mg/L) was susceptible to daptomycin (MIC: 1 mg/L). Three strains of E.faecium carrying vanA gene with vancomycin MICs above 32 mg/L and teicoplanin MICs also 32 mg/L were susceptible to daptomycin, tigecycline and linezolid. The MIC range of daptomycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus viridans was 0.032 - 0.25 mg/L and 0.125 - 1.000 mg/L separately. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin has excellent in vitro activity against common gram-positive pathogens isolated from blood. It may be a good choice for clinicians to treat drug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from infected wounds of children after Wenchuan earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the drug resistance pattern of pathogenic bacteria isolated from pediatric cases suffering from wounds infection following the Wenchuan earthquake. METHODS: Of the ninety-eight injured children, 50 had wound infection diagnosed by clinical examination. Specimens for culture were collected from the fifty injured children and the results of bacterial identification and antibiotic resistance were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: In the fifty injured children with wound infection, microbial growth was detected in 31 (62.0%) and 21 children suffered from mixed infections (the infection rate was 67.7%). Ninety-nine pathogens were isolated, gram positive bacteria accounted for 16.16% (16 strains), Gram negative bacteria accounted for 81.82% (81 strains), and fungus 2.02% (2 strains). Staphylococcus aureus (5 strains, 5.05%), Enterococcus faecalis (3 strains, 3.03%) and Enterococcus faecium (2 strains, 2.02%) were the primary Gram-positive bacteria identified and Gram-negative infections typically included Acinetobacter baumanii (27 strains, 27.27%), Enterobacter cloacae (18 strains, 18.18%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 strains, 13.13%). Acinetobacter baumanii was the most common organism isolated from wounds. Duration of being szeged and complications had a significant association with wound infection with Acinetobacter baumanii. Drug sensitivity tests displayed that the isolated bacteria were highly resistant to common antibiotics. One strain of Acinetobacter baumanii-calcoaceticus complex and six strains of Acinetobacter baumanii were resistant to all common antibiotics including imipenem/cilastatin. Vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive bacteria were not identified. CONCLUSION: Following the Wenchuan earthquake disaster, wound infection profiles of pediatric patients were significantly different, Acinetobacter baumanii was the main common organism isolated from wounds in contrast to the previous low isolation rate. The isolated bacteria were highly and multiple drug resistant and it was difficult to treat. Knowing the distribution and the drug resistance pattern of pathogen is of paramount importance in guiding the clinical treatment.
TI  - Suitability of silica hydride stationary phase, aqueous normal phase chromatography for untargeted metabolomic profiling of Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We report the robustness of silica hydride stationary phase, aqueous normal phase (ANP) chromatography to the chemical complexity of the intracellular metabolomes of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. We specifically demonstrate that the chromatographic behavior of known metabolites is unaffected by the intracellular chemical matrix of these microbes and that this method enables untargeted profiling of their intracellular metabolites using accurate mass-retention time (AMRT) identifiers. We further demonstrate the ability of AMRT-based metabolite profiling to differentiate bacteria along genetic and phenotypic lines. Overall, these data commend the utility of ANP-based chromatography for untargeted metabolomics-based studies of microbial physiology and antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Investigation of the prevalence of patients co-colonized or infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in China: a hospital-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) could lead to increased morbidity and mortality. In 2006, VRE nosocomial spread became a reality in our hospital since the first VRE nosocomial infection in 2003. Little is known about the prevalence of coexistence with VRE and MRSA in the patients. The primary objective of the study was to identify the molecular characteristics of epidemic MRSA clones in our hospital and the prevalence of the coexistence with MRSA and VRE in same patients during the 2-year period, 2006 - 2007. METHODS: The clinical features, laboratory test results, and therapeutic outcomes of 129 cases who isolated MRSA collected from January 2006 to December 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine mecA-femB type and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type. All the participants were screened for clinical and microbiological data to identify the coexistence of VRE strains with MRSA. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-nine MRSA isolates were included in the study: 71 (55%) from the intensive care unit, 35 (27.2%) from the surgical wards and 23 (17.8%) from the medical wards. The most frequent source of isolation of MRSA was sputum (76.7%). From seven patients we isolated MRSA and VRE (E. faecium) simultaneously during their inpatient stay. One hundred and twenty-seven (127/129, 98.4%) MRSA isolates harboured SCCmec type III, only 2 MRSA strains contained SCCmec type II. All of the 129 MRSA isolates remained sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. Higher sensitivity rates were noted for chloramphenicol 99.2% (128/129). Only 20.2% (26/129) of the MRSA isolates were sensitive to rifampin. All isolates presented resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents with high minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), including: beta-lactams (penicillin, oxacillin, cefoxitin, and cefazolin), tetracycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, and quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin). CONCLUSIONS: The predominant MRSA clone at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital from 2006 to 2007 had the type III SCCmec element. All of the MRSA isolates were multiresistant to antimicrobial agents. Emergence of coexistence of MRSA and VRE in the same patient was not rare. Physicians should pay more attention to infections resulting from MRSA and VRE. Aggressive infection control measures should be taken to prevent the transmission of the multidrug resistance organism.
TI  - [Bacterial composition and resistance from urinary tract infections in females].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial composition and antibacterial resistance in female urinary tract infections (UTI) in China. METHODS: The disc diffusion test, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC), test or E-test was used to detect the antimicrobial susceptibility in 86 tertiary hospitals in China from June 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007. WHONET 5.4 was applied for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6071 pathogenic germs were collected from urine cultures of UTI female patients in the surveillance period, which included 5958 bacterial isolates. Escherichia coli 3529 strains (59.23%), Enterococcus spp 938 strains (15.74%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae 394 strains (6. 61%) were the most common pathogens. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae had 35.7% and 34.0% extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) positive rates, and their resistant rates to quinolones were about 70% and 40%, respectively. Enterococcus faecium was much more resistant to almost all the antibiotics than Enterococcus faecalis. 0.9% Escherichia faecalis and 3. 8% Escherichia faecium were resistant to vancomycin, whereas 2.7% and 4.8% were resistant to teicoplanin. Staphylococcus epdermidis was more common in UTI than Staphylococcus aureus, 79.1% and 75.0% of the isolates being methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus epdermidis (MRSE) or methicillin-ressitant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), respectively. No vancomycin intermediate or resistant staphylococcus was detected, but 4.9% teicoplanin intermediate rate was found in Staphylococcus epdermidis. The resistant rates to quinolones increased with the patient age. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial resistance in UTI in Chinese females is a severe problem, which could be resulted from antimicrobial irrational use. In the selection of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of UTI, doctors should refer to the results of bacterial resistant surveillance.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  - Racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 exhibited low in vitro MICs toward small, selected panels of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against Haemophilus influenzae. The constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. DHFRs encoded by dfrB, dfrA (S1 isozyme), dfrE, and folA were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas DHFRs encoded by dfrG (S3 isozyme) and dfrF were not. Studies with the separated enantiomers of BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible DHFRs by the (R)-enantiomers. BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. Using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.
TI  - Inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western Nigeria.
AB  - A total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from African indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. Escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by Staphylococcus spp. (20%). The Gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the Staphylococcus spp. showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. Twenty-four LAB isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. LAB strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller groups through amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Representative strains were identified as Weissella spp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16S rDNA. The Weissella spp. and L. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity against seven strains of Gram negative uropathogens. Two strains of L. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against Lactobacillus sakei. In this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west Nigeria was discovered. Based on their sensitivity to Weissella spp., there is a potential for using these LAB as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.
TI  - High hydrostatic pressure for disinfection of bone grafts and biomaterials: an experimental study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autoclaving, heat, irradiation or chemical detergents are used to disinfect autografts, allografts and biomaterials for tissue reconstruction. These methods are often associated with deterioration of mechanical, physical, and biological properties of the bone grafts and synthetic implants. High hydrostatic pressure has been proposed as a novel method preserving biomechanical and biological properties of bone, tendon and cartilage. This is the first study to assess the inactivation of clinically relevant bacteria on biomaterials and human bone by high hydrostatic pressure. METHODS: Bacterial suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium, implants covered with infected blood, human bone infected in vitro, and biopsies of patients with chronic osteomyelitis were subjected to different protocols of high hydrostatic pressure up to 600 MPa. Bacterial survival after high hydrostatic pressure treatment was determined and compared with bacterial growth in untreated controls. RESULTS: S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in suspension were completely inactivated by high hydrostatic pressure (> 5log levels), whereas E. faecium showed barotolerance up to 600 MPa. Blood and adherence to metal implants did not significantly alter inactivation of bacteria, and complete disinfection was achieved with barotolerant bacteria (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa). However, osteoarthritic bone demonstrated a non-homogeneous baroprotective effect, with single bone samples resistant to treatment resulting in unaltered bacterial growth, and complete disinfection of artificially infected bone specimens was achieved in 66% for S. aureus, 60% for P. aeruginosa and 0% for E. faecium. Human bone samples of patients with chronic osteomyelitis could be completely disinfected in 2 of 37 cases. CONCLUSION: High hydrostatic pressure offers new perspectives for disinfection of sensitive biomaterials and bone grafts, and contamination by blood did not significantly affect bacterial inactivation rates. However, a significant baroprotective effect was demonstrated in bone. Effectiveness is currently limited to colonization and / or infection with barosensitive micro-organisms.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide CECT7121 against human Gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant Gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. This work investigated the efficacy of AP-CECT7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121) against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard antibiotic treatments. Inhibitory activity of AP-CECT7121 was assessed using the agar-well diffusion method. The most resistant isolates from each species screened (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. RESULTS: These bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and C. perfringens: viable counts for C. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. CONCLUSIONS: AP-CECT7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of SMP-601 (PTZ601) against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in neutropenic murine thigh infection models.
AB  - SMP-601 (also known as PTZ601, PZ-601, or SM-216601) is a novel parenteral carbapenem with potent activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The pharmacodynamics of SMP-601 against VREF and MRSA were investigated in neutropenic murine thigh infection models. The percentage of the dosing interval that the unbound SMP-601 concentration exceeded the MIC (f%T>MIC) was the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameter that correlated most closely with efficacy with R(2) values of 0.81 to 0.84 for two strains of VREF and 0.92 to 0.93 for two strains of MRSA, whereas the R(2) values for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h divided by the MIC were 0.12 to 0.89, and the R(2) values for the peak level divided by the MIC were 0 to 0.22. The f%T>MIC levels required for static or killing efficacy against two strains of VREF (9 to 19%) apparently were lower than those against two strains of MRSA (23 to 37%). These results suggested that SMP-601 showed time-dependent in vivo efficacy against VREF and MRSA, and SMP-601 had a sufficient therapeutic effect against VREF infections at lower exposure conditions compared to those for with MRSA infections.
TI  - [Glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium in a hospital in northern Spain. Molecular characterization and clinical epidemiology].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Glycopeptide resistance in Enterococcus spp. is a clinical problem  because of the rapid dissemination of these microorganisms, possible transfer of vancomycin resistance to more virulent pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, and the limited therapeutic possibilities for the infections they cause. In this study, 10 strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolated from 10 different patients in our hospital during 2004 to 2005 were characterized. METHODS: PCR was used to analyze the gene implicated in glycopeptide resistance. Molecular analysis of clinical isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The presence of genes previously associated with epidemicity/virulence (esp, hyl, asa1, gel, cyl) was also studied. Risk factors were determined in a case-control study. RESULTS: The most commonly detected gene was vanA. PFGE analysis revealed 5 different genotypes (A-E), with a predominance of genotype A (n=3) and B (n=3). The esp (surface protein) and hyl (hyaluronidase) genes were detected in all strains, with the exception of genotypes B and D. The purK1 allele, associated with clonal complex 17 was demonstrated in all strains. CONCLUSION: Prior administration of cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and vancomycin alone or in combination was significantly associated with colonization/infection by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - MurF inhibitors with antibacterial activity: effect on muropeptide levels.
AB  - MurF catalyzes the last cytoplasmic step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and is  essential for bacterial survival. Our previous studies used a pharmacophore model of a MurF inhibitor to identify additional inhibitors with improved properties. We now present the characterization of two such inhibitors, the diarylquinolines DQ1 and DQ2. DQ1 inhibited Escherichia coli MurF (50% inhibitory concentration, 24 microM) and had modest activity (MICs, 8 to 16 microg/ml) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-defective E. coli and wild-type E. coli rendered permeable with polymyxin B nonapeptide. DQ2 additionally displayed activity against gram-positive bacteria (MICs, 8 to 16 microg/ml), including methicillin (meticillin)-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates. Treatment of LPS-defective E. coli cells with >or=2x MIC of DQ1 resulted in a 75-fold-greater accumulation of the MurF substrate compared to the control, a 70% decline in the amount of the MurF product, and eventual cell lysis, consistent with the inhibition of MurF within bacteria. DQ2 treatment of S. aureus resulted in similar effects on the MurF substrate and product quantities. At lower levels of DQ1 (<or=1x MIC), the level of accumulation of the substrate was less pronounced (15-fold greater compared to the amount for the control). However, a 50% increase in the amount of the MurF product compared to the control was reproducibly observed, consistent with the possible upregulation of muropeptide biosynthesis upon partial inhibition of this pathway. The overexpression of cloned MurF appeared to partly alleviate the DQ1-mediated inhibition of muropeptide synthesis. The identification of MurF inhibitors such as DQ1 and DQ2 that disrupt cell wall biosynthesis suggests that MurF remains a viable target for an antibacterial agent.
TI  - A longitudinal analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility in clinical institutions  in Germany as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (2004-2007).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) global surveillance program has been designed to assess the in vitro activity of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent tigecycline plus several comparative agents. METHODS: In vitro activities of bacterial isolates obtained from 13 centers in Germany between 2004 and 2007 were evaluated longitudinally and pooled, using the interpretive criteria of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). RESULTS: Tigecycline demonstrated good activity against both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens monitored in this study [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) 0.06-2 microg/ml] with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had elevated MICs for most antimicrobial agents. Imipenem and meropenem also showed good activity (MIC(90) <or=0.06-4 microg/ml) against most Gram-negative pathogens but were less active against Gram-positive organisms (MIC(90) <or=0.12 to >or=32 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens monitored in the T.E.S.T. study. A low tigecycline MIC(90) was reported against Acinetobacter baumannii and drug-resistant Enterococcus faecium,Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The carbapenems showed the lowest MIC(90) values against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive E. coli. E. coli susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents decreased over the course of this study.
TI  - Ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a, an MRSA-specific PBP that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. The high binding affinity of ceftaroline to PBP2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/mL) correlates well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for MRSA. Ceftaroline is active in vitro against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (not E. faecium). The broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or AmpC-derepressed Enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. Limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. For multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/mL and 21.0 microg/mL for first and last dose, respectively. Ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 L/kg (28.3 L), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. No drug accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion (49.6%). Based on Monte Carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. Currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. A phase II study randomized 100 patients with cSSSI to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. Clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. Adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. In a phase III trial, 702 patients with cSSSI were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. Ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating cSSSI caused by both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for cSSSI and CAP, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: first cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is the first member of a new series of advanced cephalosporins with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The drug received an approvable letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2008 and from Health Canada in June 2008 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections including diabetic foot infections. Ceftobiprole exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) involved in cell wall synthesis. It has an established stability against hydrolysis by many gram-positive beta-lactamases and a higher affinity for various PBPs (such as PBP2a of MRSA or PBP2x of Streptococcus pneumoniae), which leads to a wider spectrum of activity compared with older beta-lactams. Ceftobiprole activity does not cover extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and some other pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium or Acinetobacter baumanii. Generally well tolerated, with nausea and taste disturbance being the most common adverse events, ceftobiprole appeared noninferior to empiric therapy in several clinical trials. Ceftobiprole is available only for intravenous administration; recommended dosage regimens have not been approved by the FDA as of this writing. However, based on the Canadian package insert, expected dosage recommendations are 500 mg as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 12 hours for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by certain gram-positive pathogens, and 500 mg as a 2-hour infusion every 8 hours when susceptible gram-negative or both gram-positive and susceptible gram-negative pathogens are involved. Dosage adjustments are indicated for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, and dosage recommendations are expected to be 500 or 250 mg, respectively, as a 2-hour infusion every 12 hours. Several precautions regarding hypersensitivity and drug incompatibility are reported. Ceftobiprole represents a promising option for the treatment of mono- and polymicrobial infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive and susceptible gram-negative pathogens, but further toxicity and safety studies are warranted.
TI  - Time-kill kinetics of oritavancin and comparator agents against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Oritavancin, a lipoglycopeptide, possesses bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. To understand the time dependence of oritavancin activity, we have undertaken time-kill experiments against isolates of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, including recent antibiotic-resistant strains. METHODS: Six strains of S. aureus [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA)] and five strains of enterococci [vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; both VanA and VanB)] were tested in time-kill assays; oritavancin assays included 0.002% polysorbate-80 to ensure quantitative drug recovery. Oritavancin and comparators vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and daptomycin were tested at static concentrations approximating their free peak (fC(max)) and free trough (fC(min)) in plasma when administered at standard doses for complicated skin and skin structure infections. RESULTS: Oritavancin showed concentration-dependent killing of all strains tested: at its fC(max) predicted from a 200 mg dose in humans, oritavancin exerted bactericidal activity (> or =3 log kill relative to starting inoculum) against MSSA, MRSA and VRSA within 1 h and against VSE between 11 and 24 h. At predicted fC(max) from an 800 mg dose, oritavancin was bactericidal against VISA strains at 24 h and against VRE at 10 h. CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin displayed concentration-dependent killing of MSSA, MRSA, VRSA, VISA, VSE and VRE. Oritavancin was more rapidly bactericidal against all strains tested than were vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid or daptomycin at physiologically relevant concentrations. These data support the conclusion that oritavancin exerts concentration-dependent bactericidal activity on recent, drug-resistant isolates of S. aureus and enterococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the TEST study in Europe (2004-2007).
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. This report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 European countries between 2004 and 2007. Tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most Gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the A. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (8.5% of E. coli) and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of K. pneumoniae). Only amikacin was active against >90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against Gram-positive agents across Europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected S. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the E. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the S. pneumoniae strains). Longitudinal analysis showed no increase in tigecycline MIC values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance was noted for several comparator agents.
TI  - [In vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin in combination with vancomycin  and gatifloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effects of quinupristin/dalfopristin in combination with vancomycin and gatifloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium isolates. A total 17 gram-positive bacterial isolates, composed of 4 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 5 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 3 vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEF) and 5 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF) isolates, recovered from several clinical specimens in Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Turkey, were enrolled in this study. Antibiotic susceptibilities and interactions between antibiotics were determined by E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden) method and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices were calculated for each combination. Synergistic activity was detected in only one MSSA isolate with the combination of quinupristin/dalfopristin and vancomycin (sigma FIC= 0.5). While the combination of quinupristin/dalfopristin and gatifloxacin yielded synergistic interaction in two MRSA and one MSSA isolate (sigma FIC= 0.37, 0.36 and 0.28, respectively) and additive interaction in one MSSA isolate (sigma FIC= 0.75), synergic activity was detected in one of the VREF isolate (sigma FIC= 0.29) and additive activity in two isolates (sigma FIC= 0.75 and 0.91, respectively). In this study, it was observed that the combination of quinupristin/dalfopristin and gatifloxacin was superior to the combination of quinupristin/dalfopristin and vancomycin especially in MRSA and VREF isolates. These in vitro results should be supported by in vivo studies which will guide the use of antibiotic combinations especially in the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - [In vitro activity of linezolid/ertapenem combination in resistant gram-positive  bacteria].
AB  - The increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus infections has become a major therapeutic challenge and alternative therapy options are under consideration. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of linezolid combined with ertapenem against two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strains isolated from clinical specimens. In vitro activity of linezolid/ertapenem combination at 1/2 x MIC (minimal Inhibitory Concentration), 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC concentrations for each of the isolates was determined by time-kill curve method. At 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC concentrations, additive effect was detected for MRSA (at 6 and 24 h) and VREF (at 6 h) strains. Synergism was observed between two antibiotics at 4 x MIC concentration against one of the MRSE strains at 6th hour. Additive effect was determined at 6th and 24th hours in this strain at 1 x MIC concentration. No synergism was present in the other MRSE strain but additive interaction was detected at 6 h (1/2 x MIC) and 24 h (1 x MIC). Although these results support the use of linezolid/ertapenem combination in infections caused by resistant gram-positive strains, further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent Gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  - Doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the United States for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. Although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various Gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading Gram-positive species. We evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (North America, 43.0%; Latin America, 11.7%; Europe, 31.3%; and Asia-Pacific, 14.0%) Doripenem Surveillance Program for the years 2003 to 2007. Doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; MIC(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/mL), with no differences noted between geographic regions. Against Enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC(50), 4 microg/mL) but was largely inactive against Enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). Although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the United States, doripenem was highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. Doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; MIC(90), <or=0.06 microg/mL, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; MIC(90), 0.25 microg/mL). Doripenem appears broadly active in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates from ICU and non-ICU setting and different age groups: results from the tigecycline evaluation and Surveillance trial in North America.
AB  - As part of the tigecycline evaluation and Surveillance trial (t.e.S.t.), isolates were collected from centers in North America. In vitro activity was assessed for isolates collected in 2006 using ClSi guidelines and ClSi or FDA interpretive criteria. Data were analyzed according to intensive care unit (iCU) or non-iCU location and age group (18-64 years and > 65 years).Rates of mRSA in 2006 were higher among isolates from patients aged >65 years (52.0%) than younger patients (48.4%) and from non-iCU settings (48.0%) than from the iCU (45.3%). Rates of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. (resistant to levofloxacin and amikacin as well as the carbapenems and/or third generation cephalosporins), and eSbl-producing K. pneumoniae among isolates collected from the iCU were 70.7%, 5.8%, and 16.6%, respectively.Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were active against all isolates of S. aureus, including mRSA, from both settings and the two age groups. Among E. faecium, >95% of isolates were susceptible to linezolid, and tigecycline maintained MIC(90)s of 0.06-0.12 mg/l. Against Acinetobacter spp., the most active antimicrobials were tigecycline and minocycline irrespective of age group or patient setting (MIC(90)s 2 and 8 mg/l, respectively). Percentage susceptibility off K. pneumoniae was >90% against tigecycline, imipenem, meropenem, cefepime and amikacin for isolates from both age groups and settings. Against eSbl-producing K. pneumoniae, imipenem (88.9%-96.4%) and tigecycline (85.1%-100%) demonstrated the highest rates of activity. tigecycline demonstrated excellent activity against clinically relevant resistant organisms.
TI  - Spectrum of activity and mode of action of REP3123, a new antibiotic to treat Clostridium difficile infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of REP3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) in development for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. METHODS: The spectrum of activity of REP3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of C. difficile and non-target organisms. The mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. RESULTS: REP3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of C. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant BI/NAP1/027 strains (MIC range=0.5-1 mg/L and MIC(90) = 1 mg/L). The spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90)s < 1 mg/L), but REP3123 was not active against most Gram-negative bacteria. REP3123 targeted C. difficile MetRS with a calculated inhibition constant (K(i)) of 0.020 nM, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic MetRS. The specific mode of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by REP3123, and by metS overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in MIC for REP3123. Spontaneous REP3123-resistant mutants of C. difficile (MICs, 4-128 mg/L) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the metS gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. Most of the MetRS substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. CONCLUSIONS: REP3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target C. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.
TI  - Bacterial diversity from benthic mats of Antarctic lakes as a source of new bioactive metabolites.
AB  - During the MICROMAT project, the bacterial diversity of microbial mats growing in the benthic environment of Antarctic lakes was accessed for the discovery of novel antibiotics. In all, 723 Antarctic heterotrophic bacteria belonging to novel and/or endemic taxa in the alpha-, beta- and gamma-subclasses of the Proteobacteria, the Bacteroidetes branch, and of the high and low percentage G+C Gram-positives, were isolated, cultivated in different media and at different temperatures, and then screened for the production of antimicrobial activities. A total of 6348 extracts were prepared by solid phase extraction of the culture broths or by biomass solvent extraction. 122 bacteria showed antibacterial activity against the Gram-positives Staphylococcus aureus and to a lower extent Enterococcus faecium, and versus the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Few of these strains showed also some antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus and to a lower extent Candida albicans. LC-MS fractionation of extracts from a subset of strains (hits) that exhibited relatively potent antibacterial activities evidenced a chemical novelty that was further investigated. Two strains of Arthrobacter agilis produced potent antibacterial compounds with activity against Gram-positives and possibly related to novel cyclic thiazolyl peptides. To our knowledge, this is the first report of new antibiotics produced by bacteria from benthic microbial mats from Antarctic lakes. With no doubts these microbial assemblages represent an extremely rich source for the isolation of new strains producing novel bioactive metabolites with the potential to be developed as antibiotic compounds.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological activities of mixed ligand Zr(IV) complexes.
AB  - Mixed ligand ternary Zr(IV) complexes of type [M(Q)2LNO3xH2O] have been synthesized using 8-hydroxyquinoline (HQ) as a primary ligand and N- and/O-donor amino acids (HL) such as L-serine, L-alanine and glycine as secondary ligands. These complexes were characterized on the basis of elemental analysis, conductance measurement, spectral and thermal studies. The molar conductance study of the complexes in DMF solvent signifies their non-electrolytic nature whereas the thermal analyses specify presence of a coordinated water molecule. The complexes were tested for antifungal and antibacterial activity by using agar well diffusion bioassay. The antibacterial activity was tested against the pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. The results obtained were evaluated with antibacterial standard vancomycin. The antifungal activity was tested against Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Aspergillus fumigatus and the results obtained were compared with antifungal standard amphotericin B. The complexes were also screened for cytotoxicity studies against Ehrlich ascites cells and Daltons lymphoma ascites cells and show very low cytotoxicity.
TI  - TR-700 in vitro activity against and resistance mutation frequencies among Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: TR-700, the active component of the oxazolidinone prodrug TR-701, has demonstrated potent activity against numerous Gram-positive species. In this study, single-step mutation frequencies, passaging and the activity of TR-700 were tested against a worldwide collection of linezolid-non-susceptible organisms and matched controls. METHODS: One hundred and twenty linezolid-non-susceptible and 120 controls matched by genus/species, geographic origin, site of infection and time were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. Species of isolates were: Enterococcus faecalis (16 linezolid non-susceptible/16 wild-type strains); Enterococcus faecium (55/55), Staphylococcus aureus (8/8); coagulase-negative staphylococci (at least 7 spp., 40/40) and viridans group streptococci (2 spp., 1/1). 23S rRNA target mutations or cfr genes were detected by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Among linezolid-non-susceptible strains, the resistance mechanisms were G2576T (109), cfr (4) and unknown (7), with strains originating from Europe, Far East and North and South America. Most strains were multidrug-resistant and cfr isolates exhibited co-resistance to phenicols, clindamycin, linezolid, pleuromutilins and streptogramin B. TR-700 MIC values, regardless of species, were 4-32-fold lower than those of linezolid. TR-700 MIC results were < or = 4, < or = 8 or < or = 16 mg/L for 88%, 96% and > 99% of linezolid-non-susceptible strains, respectively. Spontaneous single-step mutations were undetected (<1.1 x 10(-9)) and 14 day passaging studies produced modest TR-700 MIC elevations compared with linezolid controls. CONCLUSIONS: TR-700 exhibited enhanced activity against linezolid-non-susceptible and wild-type control strains of Gram-positive cocci. A significant number (nearly 90%) of linezolid-non-susceptible strains were inhibited by potentially achievable levels (< or = 4 mg/L) of TR-700. All strains with the emerging cfr-mediated resistance determinant had TR-700 MIC results at < or = 8 mg/L.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro activity of dicationic bis-benzimidazoles as a new class of anti-MRSA and anti-VRE agents.
AB  - A new class of novel bis-benzimidazole diamidine compounds have been synthesized  and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activities, including drug-resistant bacterial strains. Anti-MRSA and anti-VRE activities of the most potent compound 1 were more active than Vancomycin. The mechanism of action for this class of compounds appears to be different from existing antibiotics. Bis-benzimidazole diamidine compounds have potential for further investigation as a new class of potent anti-MRSA and anti-VRE agents.
TI  - Current status of newer carbapenems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Beta-lactam antibiotics represent the most commonly prescribed antibacterial agents. Since many bacteria have developed resistance to older agents, new beta-lactams have been introduced constantly. In the late 1970s, a new class of exceptionally broad-spectrum beta-lactams, the carbapenems, was identified. The carbapenems, such as the most popular imipenem and meropenem, have the widest spectra of antibacterial activity of all the beta-lactams and provide excellent coverage of many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Despite the wide antibacterial spectrum, the carbapenems globally lack activity against Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. METHODS: We reviewed the principal characteristics of the novel carbapenems and their clinical implications. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We included in our review: ertapenem, biapenem, panipenem, doripenem, tebipenem pivoxil and tomopenem.
TI  - Design and synthesis of new hydroxyethylamines as inhibitors of D-alanyl-D-lactate ligase (VanA) and D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase (DdlB).
AB  - The Van enzymes are ATP-dependant ligases responsible for resistance to vancomycin in Staphylococcus aureus and Enteroccoccus species. The de novo molecular design programme SPROUT was used in conjunction with the X-ray crystal structure of Enterococcus faeciumd-alanyl-d-lactate ligase (VanA) to design new putative inhibitors based on a hydroxyethylamine template. The two best ranked structures were selected and efficient syntheses developed. The inhibitory activities of these molecules were determined on E. faecium VanA, and due to structural similarity and a common reaction mechanism, also on d-Ala-d-Ala ligase (DdlB) from Escherichia coli. The phosphate group attached to the hydroxyl moiety of the hydroxyethylamine isostere within these systems is essential for their inhibitory activity against both VanA and DdlB.
TI  - Neopyrrolomycins with broad spectrum antibacterial activity.
AB  - Three new antibiotics, neopyrrolomycins B (1), C (2), and D (3), with potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens were discovered. They exhibited MIC values < 1 microg/mL versus a number of resistant strains. The compounds were obtained from the ethyl acetate extracts of a Streptomyces sp. after purification by column chromatography and RP-HPLC. Their structures were elucidated using X-ray crystallography (1) and NMR spectroscopy (2 and 3).
TI  - Cross-immunity and immune mimicry as mechanisms of resistance to the lantibiotic  lacticin 3147.
AB  - Lantibiotics are antimicrobial peptides that possess great potential as clinical  therapeutic agents. These peptides exhibit many beneficial traits and in many cases the emergence of resistance is extremely rare. In contrast, producers of lantibiotics synthesize dedicated immunity proteins to provide self-protection. These proteins have very specific activities and cross-immunity is rare. However, producers of two peptide lantibiotics, such as lacticin 3147, face the unusual challenge of exposure to two active peptides (alpha and beta). Here, in addition to establishing the contribution of LtnI and LtnFE to lacticin 3147 immunity, investigations were carried out to determine if production of a closely related lantibiotic (i.e. staphylococcin C55) or possession of LtnI/LtnFE homologues could provide protection. Here we establish that not only are staphylococcin C55 producers cross-immune to lacticin 3147, and therefore represent a natural repository of Staphylococcus aureus strains that are protected against lacticin 3147, but that functional immunity homologues are also produced by strains of Bacillus licheniformis and Enterococcus faecium. This result raises the spectre of resistance through immune mimicry, i.e. the emergence of lantibiotic-resistant strains from the environment resulting from the possession/acquisition of immunity gene homologues. These phenomena will have to be considered carefully when developing lantibiotics for clinical application.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tigecycline and comparative agents against clinical isolates of staphylococci and enterococci from ICUs and general hospital wards at three Swedish university hospitals.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparative agents on staphylococci and enterococci isolated from patients at general hospital wards (GHWs) and intensive care units (ICUs) at 3 university hospitals in Sweden were investigated. Oxacillin disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration with E-test were used. The presence of mecA, vanA or vanB genes was determined with PCR. Statistically significant higher incidence of clindamycin, fusidic acid, rifampicin and multidrug-resistant CoNS was found at ICUs compared to GHWs. Resistance rates were low among S. aureus. Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the only agents with high activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and multidrug-resistant CoNS. Resistance rates were low among E. faecalis, except for high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) E. faecalis. E. faecium showed high resistance rates to ampicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. The HLGR rates among E. faecium were lower than the rates for E. faecalis. Tigecycline and linezolid were the only drugs with high activity against all enterococci including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. No statistically significant differences in susceptibility rates were found between the ward levels for S. aureus and enterococcal isolates and no statistically significant differences were found between the hospitals.
TI  - Monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (BTM), as well as to clarify the relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). The purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for BTSCC at the population level. Samples of BTM were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). Staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. Based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. Counts of specific mammary pathogens in BTM samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. Significant differences were documented in BTSCC between BTM samples containing Str. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and Str. dysgalactiae and BTM samples that were pathogen-free. Geometric means of BTSCC associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall BTSCC (Str. agalactiae 243 628; Staph. aureus 205 610; Str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). It follows that the somatic cell count (SCC) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall BTSCC. Environmental pathogens predominated in samples of BTM with SCC <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in BTM samples with SCC >300x103/ml. No correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and BTSCC. This study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of BTM in relation to BTSCC is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Characterization of anti-Listeria bacteriocins isolated from shellfish: potential antimicrobials to control non-fermented seafood.
AB  - This work had as main objectives to characterize two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) previously isolated from non-fermented seafood, in order to evaluate their potential as new food protective agents. The two bacteriocinogenic isolates were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using genus- and species-specific primers, and confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing, as Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus pentosaceus. The antimicrobial spectrum of each strain included several indicator microorganisms, some of them also isolated from seafood. Growth of Listeria innocua, L. monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and other LAB species were inhibited, although no inhibition of Gram-negative microorganisms was observed. Proteolytic, but not lipolytic or glycolytic enzymes, completely inactivated the antimicrobial effect of both cell-free supernatants confirming the proteinaceous nature of the inhibitors. The antimicrobial activity was maintained after treatment with NaCl, SDS, Triton X-100, Tween 20, Tween 80 and EDTA after 2 h or 5 h of exposure and both bacteriocins were stable over a wide range of pH and temperatures. Production of bacteriocin by E. faecium (bacALP7) was detected initially at exponential phase and reached a maximum activity of 25,600 AU/ml in the early stationary phase, whereas bacteriocin production by P. pentosaceus ALP57 (bacALP57) reached the maximum at exponential phase with 12,800 AU/ml. The bacteriocins did not kill L. monocytogenes ESB54 nor L. innocua 2030c however, cellular growth was reduced. The partially purified bacteriocins, bacALP7 and bacALP57, were below 6.5 kDa in size as determined by Tricine-SDS gel electrophoresis. E. faecium and P. pentosaceus contained DNA fragments corresponding in size to those recorded for enterocin B and pediocin PA-1, respectively. Sequencing of the fragments from both bacteriocins confirmed the homology. To our knowledge, for the first time two LAB producing bacteriocins similar to pediocin PA-1 and enterocin B, were isolated from non-fermented shellfish. The adaptation of the cultures to seafood matrices may be advantageous in terms of application as a biopreservation strategy for reduction of L. monocytogenes levels in seafood products.
TI  - Antibacterial neurymenolides from the Fijian red alga Neurymenia fraxinifolia.
AB  - Two novel alpha-pyrone macrolides, neurymenolides A (1) and B (2), were isolated  from the Fijian red alga Neurymenia fraxinifolia and characterized using a combination of NMR and mass spectral analyses. These molecules represent only the second example of alpha-pyrone macrolides, with 1 existing as interchanging atropisomers due to restricted rotation about the alpha-pyrone ring system. Neurymenolide A (1) displayed moderately potent activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF).
TI  - United States resistance surveillance results for linezolid (LEADER Program for 2007).
AB  - The LEADER Program (2007) monitors for emerging linezolid resistance in sampled US medical centers, initiated in 2004. For the current reported year, the number of sites participating was increased from 50 to 60 institutions representing all 9 US census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6305 isolates, 105.1% compliance to protocol design). The organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were Staphylococcus aureus (3318), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS, 1020), enterococci (705), Streptococcus pneumoniae (622), and viridans group (249) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (391); also, D-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in S. aureus strains. Linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with MIC(90) results ranging from 1 microg/mL (streptococci and CoNS) to 2 microg/mL (S. aureus and enterococci). Only 0.44% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, compared with 0.45% in 2006. The nonsusceptible strains (23) were usually staphylococci (20) or Enterococcus faecium (8), each with defined target mutations (G2576T, 24 strains) or a novel mobile cfr element in staphylococci (2 strains). In conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 4th year of this LEADER Program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.56% susceptibility). Although the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable, a new plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism emerged in S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from Arizona and Ohio. The LEADER Program appears to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect novel resistance phenotypes and genotypes.
TI  - Enterococcal infections & antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - Enterococci have traditionally regarded as low grade pathogens, have emerged as an increasingly important cause of nosocomial infections in the last decade. Although about a dozen enterococcus species have been identified, only two are responsible for the majority of human infections, i.e., Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. The most common nosocomial infections produced by these organisms are urinary tract infections (associated with instrumentation and antimicrobial resistance), followed by intra-abdominal and pelvic infections. They also cause surgical wound infections, bacteraemia, endocarditis, neonatal sepsis and rarely meningitis. A major reason why these organisms survive in hospital environment is the intrinsic resistance to several commonly used antibiotics and, perhaps more importantly, their ability to acquire resistance to all currently available antibiotics, either by mutation or by receipt of foreign genetic material through the transfer of plasmids and transposons. The emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) is a cause of concern, as once established, it is very difficult to control. Moreover, there can be transfer of resistant gene from enterococci to Staphylococcus aureus thereby posing a threat to the patient safety and also challenges for the treating physicians. This review highlights the shifting spectrum of enterococcal infections, along with their geographical distribution and growing nosocomial importance. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance, pathogenicity and virulence factors, current preventive, control and treatment modalities of severe enterococcal infections are also dealt with.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline and other antimicrobials against Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms collected from the Asia-Pacific Rim as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST).
AB  - As part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST), Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms were collected from 31 medical centres in nine countries in the Asia-Pacific Rim between 2004 and 2007. Overall, 34.2% of Acinetobacter spp. were multidrug-resistant, and 17.0% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 10.6% of Escherichia coli produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. A total of 39.5% of Staphylococcus aureus were meticillin-resistant and 21.7% of Enterococcus faecium were vancomycin-resistant. Tigecycline MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) were <or=2mg/L against Acinetobacter spp., K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and <or=0.25mg/L against S. aureus, E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Antimicrobial resistance is widespread in the Asia-Pacific Rim. Tigecycline has excellent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including resistant strains.
TI  - Highly resistant microorganisms in a teaching hospital: the role of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence density of highly resistant organisms (HROs) and the relative contribution of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity. METHODS: Prospective surveillance was performed among hospitalized patients during an 18-month period. Enterobacteriaceae, nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium--all considered highly resistant, according to Dutch guidelines--were included. Epidemiological linkage and nosocomial transmission were determined on the basis of molecular typing and hospital admission data. RESULTS: From 119 patients, we recovered a total of 170 unique HRO isolates, as follows: Escherichia coli, 96 isolates; Klebsiella species, 11 isolates; Enterobacter species, 8 isolates; Proteus species, 9 isolates; Citrobacter species, 5 isolates; Pseudomonas species, 5 isolates; Acinetobacter species, 3 isolates; Morganella species, 2 isolates; Salmonella species, 1 isolate; Serratia species, 1 isolate; S. pneumoniae, 20 isolates; and S. aureus, 9 isolates. No vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was found. The incidence density was 4.3 HRO isolates per 10,000 patient-days. The majority of HRO isolates were unique, and nosocomial transmission was observed 4 times for highly resistant gram-negative bacilli (case reproduction rate, 0.05) and 4 times for penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (case reproduction rate, 0.29). A stay on the intensive care unit was the main determinant for the recovery of an HRO. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial transmission of HROs was observed 8 times during the 18-month period. The intensive care unit was identified as the main reservoir of horizontal spread of HROs. This study shows that nosocomial transmission of HROs is largely preventable using transmission precautions.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the ornamental species Salvia corrugata, a potential new crop for extractive purposes.
AB  - As a part of our search for biologically active compounds from cultivated Salvia  spp. we investigated Salvia corrugata Vahl. The activity of two isolated icetaxane diterpene quinones, fruticuline A and demethylfruticuline A, was assessed against 46 bacterial pathogens, mostly resistant to several primary antibiotics. The MIC for all the inhibited Gram-positive pathogens tested showed a very narrow distribution and ranged from 32 to 64 mg/L, regardless of their resistance patterns to other antibiotics. Demethylfruticuline A was shown to be highly bactericidal (>3 log(10) CFU decrease within 24 h) against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and bacteriostatic against Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Fruticuline A manifested bacteriostatic activity against all tested strains. S. corrugata can be viewed as an interesting source for these diterpenes, which, if well tolerated in vivo, may represent new medical agents useful for the treatment of serious infections caused by resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - A facile synthesis, antibacterial, and antitubercular studies of some piperidin-4-one and tetrahydropyridine derivatives.
AB  - The raise in clinical significance of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens has directed us to synthesize 2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-one and Delta(3)-tetrahydropyridin-4-ol based benzimidazole and O-arylsulfonyl derivatives. X-ray crystal structure of tetrahydropyridinol (23) confirmed a change in conformation and orientation of substituents upon amide formation. Antibacterial activities evaluated against a wide number of bacterial pathogens (both sensitive and multidrug-resistant) revealed that 19, 27 against Staphylococcus aureus, 27 against Enterococcus faecalis, and 19, 21, 23, and 27 against Enterococcus faecium are significantly good at lowest MIC(90) (16 microg/mL). Inhibitory power noticed by 23 against Vancomycin-Linezolid-resistant E. faecalis and 27 against Vancomycin-resistant E. faecium are onefold better than the standard Linezolid and Trovafloxacin drugs, respectively. Moreover, antitubercular activity for the selected compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv revealed that compounds 23, 24, and 27 expressed onefold improved potency compared to the standard Rifampicin drug.
TI  - NHSN annual update: antimicrobial-resistant pathogens associated with healthcare-associated infections: annual summary of data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006-2007.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of selected antimicrobial resistance patterns among pathogens causing device-associated and procedure-associated healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) reported by hospitals in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). METHODS: Data are included on HAIs (ie, central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections) reported to the Patient Safety Component of the NHSN between January 2006 and October 2007. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of up to 3 pathogenic isolates per HAI by a hospital were evaluated to define antimicrobial-resistance in the pathogenic isolates. The pooled mean proportions of pathogenic isolates interpreted as resistant to selected antimicrobial agents were calculated by type of HAI and overall. The incidence rates of specific device-associated infections were calculated for selected antimicrobial-resistant pathogens according to type of patient care area; the variability in the reported rates is described. RESULTS: Overall, 463 hospitals reported 1 or more HAIs: 412 (89%) were general acute care hospitals, and 309 (67%) had 200-1,000 beds. There were 28,502 HAIs reported among 25,384 patients. The 10 most common pathogens (accounting for 84% of any HAIs) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (15%), Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Enterococcus species (12%), Candida species (11%), Escherichia coli (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%), Enterobacter species (5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (3%), and Klebsiella oxytoca (2%). The pooled mean proportion of pathogenic isolates resistant to antimicrobial agents varied significantly across types of HAI for some pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. As many as 16% of all HAIs were associated with the following multidrug-resistant pathogens: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (8% of HAIs), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (4%), carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (2%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae (1%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (0.5%), and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and E. coli (0.5%). Nationwide, the majority of units reported no HAIs due to these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) outbreak at a university hospital in Kitakyushu, Japan: case-control studies.
AB  - At a university hospital in Japan, a total of 15 patients (14 adults and 1 newborn baby) with vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE) infection or colonization (inf/col) were identified via routine clinical examinations and two nonroutine examinations from January to April 2007. Two case-control studies were conducted to identify the factors related to VRE inf/col. In study 1, the patients with VRE inf/col from ward A (n = 8) were compared with all of the patients without VRE isolates in the same ward, i.e., the controls (n = 26). In study 2, all adult patients with VRE inf/col throughout the hospital (n = 14) were compared with controls randomly selected from among all patients without VRE isolates (n = 45). All the subject cases were found to be infected or colonized with Enterococcus faecium, vanB. All but two of the isolated strains were completely identical according to pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Univariate analysis in study 2 showed several factors, including the isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (odds ratio [OR], 8.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-53.7) and the use of antibiotics other than anti-MRSA drugs (OR, 33.0; 95% CI, 1.8-587.6) to be risk factors for VRE inf/col. Multivariate logistic regression analysis in study 2 demonstrated associations with VRE inf/col in the use of an ultrasound nebulizer (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.5-22.8) and extended bed rest (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.02-24.5). Although severe infection with VRE did not occur, to avoid the spread of VRE in hospital wards, further staff education should be implemented in regard to the usual standard and contact precautions, and the appropriate selection of antibiotics.
TI  - [Emergence of vancomycin-dependent enterococci following glycopeptide therapy: case report and review].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been increasingly reported in France over the last three years. We report here, the emergence of a vancomycin-dependent enterococci isolate following glycopeptide therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An Enterococcus faecium isolate that required vancomycin for growth was cultured from the stools of a liver transplant recipient who was colonised with vancomycin-resistant enterococci and who received vancomycin treatment for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. The resistant isolate and the dependent isolate were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the ddl gene coding for the D-Ala: D-Ala ligase was analysed. RESULTS: The dependent isolate was primary cultured onto a vancomycin-containing screening medium and could not be subcultured in the absence of vancomycin. Both the resistant and dependent isolates harboured the vanA gene and they had the same DNA restriction pattern after pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Dependence on vancomycin was associated with a 1-bp deletion in the D-Ala: D-Ala ligase gene leading to an early stop odon. CONCLUSION: Cultures onto vancomycin-containing media are warranted for clinical specimens from patients, who are known to carry vancomycin-resistant enterococci and receive vancomycin therapy.
TI  - Development and application of the active surveillance of pathogens microarray to monitor bacterial gene flux.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human and animal health is constantly under threat by emerging pathogens that have recently acquired genetic determinants that enhance their survival, transmissibility and virulence. We describe the construction and development of an Active Surveillance of Pathogens (ASP) oligonucleotide microarray, designed to 'actively survey' the genome of a given bacterial pathogen for virulence-associated genes. RESULTS: The microarray consists of 4958 reporters from 151 bacterial species and include genes for the identification of individual bacterial species as well as mobile genetic elements (transposons, plasmid and phage), virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes. The ASP microarray was validated with nineteen bacterial pathogens species, including Francisella tularensis, Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The ASP microarray identified these bacteria, and provided information on potential antibiotic resistance (eg sufamethoxazole resistance and sulfonamide resistance) and virulence determinants including genes likely to be acquired by horizontal gene transfer (e.g. an alpha-haemolysin). CONCLUSION: The ASP microarray has potential in the clinic as a diagnostic tool, as a research tool for both known and emerging pathogens, and as an early warning system for pathogenic bacteria that have been recently modified either naturally or deliberately.
TI  - Lynamicins A-E, chlorinated bisindole pyrrole antibiotics from a novel marine actinomycete.
AB  - A series of chlorinated bisindole pyrroles, lynamicins A-E (1-5), was discovered  from a novel marine actinomycete, NPS12745, which was isolated from a marine sediment collected off the coast of San Diego, California. Close to full length 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that NPS12745 is a novel strain of a recently described marine actinomycete with the proposed genus name Marinispora. The antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds was evaluated against a panel of 11 pathogens, which demonstrated that these substances possess broad-spectrum activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Significantly, compounds 1-5 were active against drug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - Acquired vancomycin resistance in clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - Acquired resistance to vancomycin is an increasing problem in pathogenic bacteria. It is best studied and most prevalent among Enterococcus and still remains rare in other pathogenic bacteria. Different genotypes of vancomycin resistance, vanA-G, have been described. The different van gene clusters consist of up to nine genes encoding proteins of different functions; their interplay leads to an alternative cell wall precursor less susceptible to glycopeptide binding. Variants of vanA and vanB types are found worldwide, with vanA predominating; their reservoir is Enterococcus faecium. Within this species a subpopulation of hospital-adapted types exists that acquired van gene clusters and which is responsible for outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococci all over the world. Acquisition of vanA by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is worrisome and seven cases have been described. Nonsusceptibility to glycopeptides also occurs independently from van genes and is a growing therapeutic challenge, especially in MRSA.
TI  - Vancomycin resistance VanS/VanR two-component systems.
AB  - Vancomycin is a member of the glycopeptide class of antibiotics. Vancomycin resistance (van) gene clusters are found in human pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-producing actinomycetes such as Amycolotopsis orientalis, Actinoplanes teichomyceticus and Streptomyces toyocaensis and the nonglycopeptide producing actinomycete Streptomyces coelicolor. Expression of the van genes is activated by the VanS/VanR two-component system in response to extracellular glycopeptide antibiotic. Two major types of inducible vancomycin resistance are found in pathogenic bacteria; VanA strains are resistant to vancomycin itself and also to the lipidated glycopeptide teicoplanin, while VanB strains are resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to teicoplanin. Here we discuss the enzymes the van genes encode, the range of different VanS/VanR two-component systems, the biochemistry of VanS/VanR, the nature of the effector ligand(s) recognised by VanS and the evolution of the van cluster.
TI  - Infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Greece.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the patients who developed an infection in our surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS: This was a prospective study of all patients who sustained an ICU-acquired infection from 2002 to 2004. RESULTS: Among 683 consecutive SICU patients, 123 (18.0%) developed 241 infections (48.3 infections per 1000 patient-days). The mean age of patients was 66.7+/-3.8 years, the mean APACHE II score (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) on SICU admission was 18.2+/-2.4, and the mean SOFA score (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) at the onset of infection was 8.8+/-2. Of the study patients, 51.2% were women. Infections were: bloodstream (36.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; 25.3%, 20.3/1000 ventilator-days), surgical site (18.7%), central venous catheter (10.4%, 7.1/1000 central venous catheter-days), and urinary tract infection (9.5%, 4.6/1000 urinary catheter-days). The most frequent microorganisms found were: Acinetobacter baumannii (20.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), Candida albicans (13.2%), Enterococcus faecalis (10.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), Enterococcus faecium (7.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%). High resistance to the majority of antibiotics was identified. The complication and mortality rates were 58.5% and 39.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified APACHE II score on admission (odds ratio (OR) 4.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.69-5.26, p=0.01), peritonitis (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.25, p=0.03), acute pancreatitis (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05-3.75, p=0.02), previous aminoglycoside use (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.06-5.14, p=0.03), and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 2.43-6.15, p=0.01) as risk factors for infection development. Age (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p=0.03), APACHE II score on admission (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.77-3.41, p=0.02), SOFA score at the onset of infection (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.85-4.02, p=0.02), and VAP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.85, p=0.03) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Infections are an important problem in SICUs due to high incidence, multi-drug resistance, complications, and mortality rate. In our study, APACHE II score on admission, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, previous aminoglycoside use, and mechanical ventilation were identified as risk factors for infection development, whereas age, APACHE II score on admission, SOFA score at the onset of infection, and VAP were associated with mortality.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in Greece.
AB  - A total of 10420 Gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten Greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to daptomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method. Daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) = 1mg/L and MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) = 1.36 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC50 = 1.36 mg/L and MIC90 = 1.90 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.50mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50 = 0.09 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50 = 0.50 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.89 mg/L). Resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. On the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 = 0.44 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.78 mg/L) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.44 mg/L); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an MIC > 1mg/L, which is the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. For all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.

TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) accelerates identification of Gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. Rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. To accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) targeting Gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. By combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium/durans. Furthermore, the newly designed FISH probes STREP2, ENCO and GRANU targeted Streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, Enterococcus spp. (except E. faecalis) and Granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. The FISH assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and reliable molecular identification of Gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.
TI  - Inhibition of vancomycin and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci strains and Listeria monocytogenes by bacteriocin-like substance produced by Enterococcus faecium E86.
AB  - Three hundred and thirty nine lactic bacteria strains isolated from food samples  were screened for antimicrobial activity. Only one strain isolated from meat pie and identified as Enterococcus faecium produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) showing activity against Enterococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Listeria, Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus aureus. The BLIS produced was resistant to acid and alkali treatment and 121 masculineC for 15 min. The addition of BLIS in BHI contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes decreased the contamination in 4.8 log cycles in 24 h. The inhibition of listeria was also obtained in milk. Forty multiresistant enterococci strains were inhibited in the well-diffusion test. Two vancomycin resistant strains tested in liquid with BLIS were also inhibited. The BLIS producer showed no pathogenicity marker.
TI  - Pargamicin A, a novel cyclic peptide antibiotic from Amycolatopsis sp.
AB  - A novel cyclic peptide antibiotic, pargamicin A was isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete strain. The producing organism, designated ML1-hF4, was identified as a member of the genus Amycolatopsis. Pargamicin A was identified as a novel cyclic hexapeptide antibiotic containing piperazic acid by various spectroscopic analyses. Pargamicin A showed potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus strains including MRSA and Enterococcus faecalis/faecium strains including VRE.
TI  - Characterization of the peptidoglycan of vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Vancomycin and other antibacterial glycopeptide analogues target the cell wall and affect the enzymatic processes involved with cell-wall biosynthesis. Understanding the structure and organization of the peptidoglycan is the first step in establishing the mode of action of these glycopeptides. We have used solid-state NMR to determine the relative concentrations of stem-links (64%), bridge-links (61%), and cross-links (49%) in the cell walls of vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium (ATTC 49624). Furthermore, we have determined that in vivo only 7% of the peptidoglycan stems terminate in d-Ala- d-Ala, the well-known vancomycin-binding site. Presumably, d-Ala- d-Ala is cleaved from uncross-linked stems in mature peptidoglycan by an active carboxypeptidase. We believe that most of the few pentapeptide stems ending in d-Ala- d-Ala occur in the template and nascent peptidoglycan strands that are crucial for cell-wall biosynthesis.
TI  - Exploring 9-benzyl purines as inhibitors of glutamate racemase (MurI) in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - An early SAR study of a screening hit series has generated a series of 9-benzyl purines as inhibitors of bacterial glutamate racemase (MurI) with micromolar enzyme potency and improved physical properties. X-ray co-crystal EI structures were obtained.
TI  - The culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - AIM: Traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. AIM: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. METHODS: A cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. After surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. Identification of bacteria as well as computation of mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. Wilcoxon's paired and Chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. Positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (P<0.001). The microorganisms identified were Escherichia coli (14 cases) and Enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (P<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). Mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (P<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. CONCLUSION: The neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. This difference might be attributed to the presence of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the region.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. DATA SOURCES: Literature identification was conducted through MEDLINE (1966-February 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, BAL 5788, RO-5788, BAL 9141, RO 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, MRSA, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. Additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles in English were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecium. Preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. Two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for cSSSIs. Ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive cSSSIs, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. Furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial cSSSIs (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). Although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. CONCLUSIONS: The activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful as empiric monotherapy for cSSSI and in combination with other antimicrobials in lower respiratory tract infections for which Phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. Although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. Approval is expected for the treatment of cSSSI.
TI  - Design and synthesis of benzenesulfonanilides active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
AB  - Vancomycin is mainly used as an antibacterial agent of last resort, but recently  vancomycin-resistant bacterial strains have been emerging. Although new antimicrobials have been developed in order to overcome drug-resistant bacteria, many are structurally complex beta-lactams or quinolones. In this study, we aimed to create new anti-drug-resistance antibacterials which can be synthesized in a few steps from inexpensive starting materials. Since sulfa drugs function as p-aminobenzoic acid mimics and inhibit dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) in the folate pathway, we hypothesized that sulfa derivatives would act as folate metabolite-mimics and inhibit bacterial folate metabolism. Screening of our sulfonanilide libraries, including benzenesulfonanilide-type cyclooxygenase-1-selective inhibitors, led us to discover benzenesulfonanilides with potent anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)/vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) activity, that is, N-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-3,5-dichlorobenzenesulfonanilide (16b) [MIC=0.5microg/mL (MRSA), 1.0microg/mL (VRE)], and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-N-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)benzenesulfonanilide (16c) [MIC=0.5microg/mL (MRSA), 1.0microg/mL (VRE)]. These compounds are more active than vancomycin [MIC=2.0microg/mL (MRSA), 125microg/mL (VRE)], but do not possess an amino group, which is essential for DHPS inhibition by sulfa drugs. These results suggested that the mechanism of antibacterial action of compounds 16b and 16c is different from that of sulfa drugs. We also confirmed the activity of these compounds against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial activity. However, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. METHODS: We assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of Revamil (Bfactory), a medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. RESULTS: With Bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. Antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. After 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers was reduced 100-fold (P < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin against recent Gram-positive clinical isolates: results of the 2004-05 Prospective European Surveillance Initiative.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Telavancin is a novel semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide currently in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of serious infections due to Gram-positive bacteria. The objective of this study was to provide a baseline prospective assessment of its in vitro activity against a large and diverse collection of Gram-positive clinical isolates from Europe and Israel. METHODS: Gram-positive clinical isolates, collected between October 2004 and December 2005 from 36 hospital laboratories in 15 countries, were tested by broth microdilution using CLSI methodology. RESULTS: In total, 3206 isolates were collected. Telavancin had potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC range < or =0.015 to 2 mg/L), independent of resistance to methicillin or to multiple drugs. Telavancin had particularly strong activity against streptococcal isolates (MIC range < or =0.001 to 0.5 mg/L), including penicillin-resistant and multiple drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and erythromycin non-susceptible beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. Telavancin also had excellent activity against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L), and although its MICs were elevated against VanA strains (Enterococcus faecalis MIC(90) 8 mg/L and Enterococcus faecium MIC(90) 4 mg/L), its MIC(90) was substantially lower than observed with available glycopeptides. CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin has potent in vitro activity against contemporary Gram-positive clinical isolates from diverse geographic areas in Europe and Israel.
TI  - An assessment of linezolid utilization in selected canadian provinces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is approved for the treatment of designated infections caused by methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. OBJECTIVE: To characterize linezolid utilization since its launch in Canada in 2001. METHODS: Demographics, antimicrobial regimens, and clinical and resource utilization data for linezolid-treated patients were collected retrospectively by hospital pharmacists at nine tertiary care hospitals in four provinces. Statistics describing linezolid utilization were calculated and the appropriateness of use was assessed according to a treatment algorithm based on recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Pharmacy Specialty Network in 2001. RESULTS: Ninety-nine linezolid courses were prescribed for 103 infections in 95 patients (mean age 57.8 years, 52.6% male) with an average length of hospital stay of 40.6 days. Fifty-three per cent of patients had an allergy to at least one antibiotic other than linezolid. The major use of linezolid was for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (32.0%), followed by bacteremia (15.5%). The most prevalent pathogen was methicillin-resistant S aureus, identified in 44.7% of infections. Linezolid was primarily prescribed as the oral form following other intravenous anti-infectives (55.6% of courses) for an average duration of 14.4 days. The rate of appropriate utilization was 53% (range 25% to 75% by site). In 93.5% of courses deemed inappropriate, recommended first-line therapies were not attempted before linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid was prescribed appropriately in approximately one-half of cases reviewed. The rate of appropriate utilization is similar to those rates reported in other Canadian antibiotic reviews.
TI  - A comparative in-vitro evaluation of resistance selection after exposure to teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin in Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.
AB  - The ability of breakpoint and serum concentrations of teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin to select resistance was compared for isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Mutation frequencies were always <10(-10), except for two isolates grown in the presence of teicoplanin at the trough serum concentration. After multistep selection, linezolid selected for resistance in staphylococci and enterococci, and serial exposure to certain concentrations of linezolid was more likely to select for stable resistance in MRSA, MSSA and enterococci than was exposure to glycopeptides and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
TI  - Seawater requirement for the production of lipoxazolidinones by marine actinomycete strain NPS8920.
AB  - A novel marine actinomycete strain NPS8920 produces a new class of 4-oxazolidinone antibiotics lipoxazolidinone A, B and C. Lipoxazolidinone A possesses good potency (1-2 microg/mL) against drug-resistant pathogens methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE). Strain NPS8920 exhibits different morphologies in both agar and submerged cultures. The ability of strain NPS8920 to sporulate on saline-based agar media but not on deionized water-based agar medium supported that strain NPS8920 is a marine actinomycete. While strain NPS8920 does not require seawater for growth, the production of lipoxazolidinones by strain NPS8920 can only be detected in the seawater-based media. The optimal production of lipoxazolidinones was observed in the natural seawater-based medium. Strain NPS8920 produced 10-20% of lipoxazolidinones in the synthetic sea salt Instant Ocean-based medium and no production in the sodium chloride-based and deionized water-based media.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2005-2006).
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and nosocomial pneumonia. This agent is also active against other prominent Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. We evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe). All isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/mL, respectively, although MIC90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. Ceftobiprole was also broadly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/mL. Although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against Enterococcus faecium, the majority of Enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/mL. This agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (MIC50 values, < or =0.06 microg/mL) for all tested Enterobacteriaceae. Although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against Klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/mL versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (MIC50, 2 microg/mL) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. None of these agents inhibited >45% of Acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole is a new anti-MRSA beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. These characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for cSSSIs, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where MRSA and P. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
TI  - Update on the appropriate use of linezolid in clinical practice.
AB  - Multi-antibiotic resistant Gram-positive cocci, which include Staphylococcus aureus, the coagulase-negative staphylococcal group, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and other streptococci, represent emerging pathogens especially in the setting of the immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, in particular when surgery, invasive procedures, or prosthetic implants are of concern, patients are admitted in intensive care units, or underlying chronic disorders and immunodeficiency are of concern, and broad-spectrum antibiotics or immunosuppressive drugs are widely administered. During the recent years, the phenomenon of multiresistant Gram-positive cocci is spreading to the community, where the retrieval of such microorganism is progressively increasing. The spectrum of available antimicrobial compounds for an effective management of these relevant infections is significantly impaired in selection and clinical efficacy by the emerging and spread of methicillin-resistant and more recently glycopeptide-resistant Gram-positive microbial strains. The first oxazolidinone derivative linezolid, together with the recently licensed quinupristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin, and tigecycline, followed by a number of glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones, and other experimental compounds on the pipeline, represent an effective response to the great majority of these concerns, due to their innovative mechanisms of action, their maintained or enhanced activity against multiresistant pathogens, their effective pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, their frequent possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds effective against Gram-positive pathogens, and a diffuse potential for a safe and easy administration, also when compromised patients are of concern. The main problems related to the epidemiological and clinical features of multiresistant Gram-positive infection, the potential clinical indications of all recently available compounds compared with the standard of care of treatment of resistant Gram-positive infections, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of linezolid as the golden standard compound for vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci in multiple clinical situations, are outlined and updated on the ground of an extensive review of all the available, recent evidences coming from the international literature.
TI  - Detection of daptomycin-nonsusceptible strains using the Neo-Sensitab prediffusion method.
AB  - Two prediffusion methods with daptomycin (DAP) Neo-Sensitabs were evaluated against a challenge set of 30 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 30 enterococci. DAP Neo-Sensitabs were prediffused for either 8 or 20 h on Mueller-Hinton agar. Inhibition zones were plotted versus Etest MIC values determined on the same prediffused agar. A generalization to the genus level of the manufacturer's suggested Neo-Sensitabs breakpoints for staphylococci and enterococci was used to interpret the results. DAP-susceptible and DAP-nonsusceptible enterococci, Enterococcus faecium in particular, were not reliably discriminated using a 20-h prediffusion method and the manufacturer's suggested breakpoints. Further development of this testing methodology, such as changing the format to a susceptibility screen followed by a confirmatory MIC, is needed to accurately categorize the DAP susceptibility of enterococcal isolates. Prediffusion for either 8 or 20 h with DAP Neo-Sensitabs discriminated between susceptible and nonsusceptible S. aureus with minimal errors. Both prediffusion methods also detected changes in MIC values between isogenic pairs of susceptible and nonsusceptible S. aureus. These results suggest that a multisite evaluation of either prediffusion method with DAP Neo-Sensitabs against a larger collection of S. aureus is warranted.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of twenty lysine-peptoid hybrids against clinically relevant bacteria and fungi.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper describes the antimicrobial activities of 20 lysine-peptoid hybrids against a selection of clinically relevant bacteria and fungi. METHODS: Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (ATCC 33591), vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (ATCC 700699 MU50), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (ATCC 700221), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Salmonella typhimurium (clinical isolate), Klebsiella pneumoniae (clinical isolate), amphotericin-B-resistant C. albicans (ATCC 200955) and Cryptococcus neoformans (clinical isolate). RESULTS: The lysine-peptoid hybrids proved to be active against all strains tested, except K. pneumoniae. For each susceptible strain, we identified at least 4 lysine-peptoid hybrids showing excellent activity. The most active compounds displayed minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from < or =1.6 to 6.25 microM. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that lysine-peptoid hybrids show activity against drug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Development of multiple resistances to antibiotics in staphylococci, enterococci  and pneumococci became a health threat during the past 20 years, not only with respect to nosocomial infections. This resistance development is based on acquisition of resistance genes by predominant epidemic subpopulations (clonal complexes). Although emergence and spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is associated with a limited number of epidemic clones which have been widely disseminated, acquisition of SCCmec elements by susceptible ancestors has taken place at different times and at different locations. Among Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium, one clonal complex, which had acquired resistance genes at several occasions, is widely disseminated in hospitals. Also in Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotic resistance is preferentially associated with clonal lineages which have a capacity for spreading. They became, however, more rare after introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of heyneanol A extracted from the root of Taiwanese wild grape.
AB  - AIMS: To search for antimicrobial compounds against pathogenic bacteria from grape vines (Vitis spp.). To investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of active compounds towards methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: The root extracts of taiwanese wild grape (Vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana) showed marked activities against Gram-positive bacteria using the disc diffusion method. After purification, the active compound 1 was confirmed as heyneanol A by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Heyneanol A showed an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 2 microg ml(-1) towards MRSA and a value of 2 to 4 microg ml(-1) for Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the contents of heyneanol A were determined as 36 mg g(-1) in roots of taiwanese wild grape. CONCLUSIONS: The root extracts of grapevines have good antimicrobial activities towards some strains of Gram-positive pathogens. Heyneanol A, the major antimicrobial compound, is especially active towards MRSA. In addition, the abundances of heyneanol A and other stilbenes in the roots of grapevines make it possible to produce natural antimicrobial compounds from this plant species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reports for the first time the antimicrobial compounds in the root extracts of grapevines. The results will have clinical significance owing to their activities against MRSA.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of omiganan pentahydrochloride tested against contemporary bacterial pathogens commonly responsible for catheter-associated infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Omiganan pentahydrochloride is a cidal cationic peptide with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum, including yeast, currently in development as a topical agent for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. We evaluated the spectrum and potency of omiganan against pathogens commonly associated with such infections. METHODS: A recent (2005-06) collection of bacterial isolates originating from patients with bloodstream, respiratory tract, and skin and skin structure infections in US medical centres was evaluated by reference broth microdilution methods against omiganan and comparator agents. RESULTS: All tested gram-positive (390) and -negative (167) isolates were inhibited by < or = 128 and < or = 1024 mg/L, respectively, of omiganan. The agent was the most active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (range 1-8 mg/L; MIC(50/90), 4 mg/L) and inhibited all Staphylococcus aureus at < or = 32 mg/L (MIC(50/90), 16 mg/L). Omiganan was 16-fold more active against Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90) results, 4/8 versus 64/128 mg/L, respectively). MIC ranges and MIC(50) potencies were unaffected by methicillin resistance in staphylococci, vancomycin resistance in enterococci, and penicillin resistance in streptococci. Omiganan potency was also unaffected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production in Escherichia coli when compared with wild-type strains (MIC(50) values 32 mg/L), although a 4-fold increase was noted among ESBL-positive Klebsiella spp. (128 versus 32 mg/L, respectively). Wild-type Enterobacter spp. displayed higher omiganan MIC(50/90) results (64/512 mg/L) compared with AmpC-hyperproducing strains (32/64 mg/L). Carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant P. aeruginosa strains exhibited omiganan MIC(50/90) values of 128/256 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: At a 1% (10 000 mg/L) topical gel formulation, omiganan can be expected to inhibit all clinically relevant bacterial species producing catheter-associated infections (all MIC values, < or = 1024 mg/L), including those with antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - Linezolid in children: recent patents and advances.
AB  - Linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. It has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. With regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant Gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. Clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA, VRE bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. We anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as VRE- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. Some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.
TI  - Response to emerging infection leading to outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Linezolid was approved in 2000 for treatment of gram-positive coccal infections.  We performed a case-control study during a hospital outbreak of linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE) infections, comparing cases of LRE infection (cases) with linezolid-sensitive enterococci infections (controls). Nasal and perirectal swab samples were obtained from all patients in a 1-day point-prevalence survey. We examined antimicrobial drug use and calculated the defined daily dose of linezolid per 1,000 patient-days. Fifteen LRE cases were identified (13 Enterococcus faecalis and 2 E. faecium); 7 were vancomycin-resistant. Compared with controls, case-patients had increased in-hospital mortality rates and lengths of stay. Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of LRE infection: prior cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 27), hospitalization duration before index culture (AOR 1.1 per day), and duration of preceding linezolid therapy (AOR 1.1 per day). Linezolid exposure and patient-to-patient transmission appear to be responsible for LRE infections, an important emeraina hospital problem.
TI  - Mechanisms of resistance to daptomycin in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - In this study, we investigated the clonal emergence of daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from a patient with leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome. The resistance mechanism in these strains is independent of either equivalent point mutations previously described for Staphylococcus aureus or daptomycin inactivation mechanisms identified in soil bacteria.
TI  - Screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in Enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of 139 Enterococcus isolates (48 E. faecium and 91 E. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteriocin (BAC) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least one of 6 indicator strains (BAC+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 E. faecium and 22 E. faecalis). Twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (entA, entB, entL50AB, and cylL) showed a BAC+ phenotype. The existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied because the BAC+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 Enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. The antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative strains (Salmonella Enteritidis and E. coli) was detected in the 6 Enterococcus isolates that had either the entA, entB, entL50AB or cylL genes. Moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes among the cylL-positive E. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). The results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.
TI  - A class IIa peptide from Enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  - Peptide ST4SA, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA, inhibits the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. The peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to S. pneumoniae 40, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and E. faecium HKLHS. Low concentrations of peptide ST4SA (51200 arbitrary units (AU)/mL) caused DNA and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400AU/mL caused cell lysis. No decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. Peptide ST4SA revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. Peptide ST4SA dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.
TI  - Synthesis, SAR, and antibacterial activity of novel oxazolidinone analogues possessing urea functionality.
AB  - The syntheses of a number of novel oxazolidinone analogues possessing an urea functionality are reported. While the urea derivatives possessing aliphatic and aromatic groups were prepared by the more conventional isocyanate method, the derivatives possessing heterocyclic rings were synthesized by a relatively uncommon but otherwise efficient carbamate chemistry. Though the SAR resulted in novel compounds possessing in vitro activity equivalent to Linezolid, the compounds possess a range of substituents that are amenable for altering physicochemical properties of the resultant drug. The antibacterial activity was found to be not sensitive to the functional groups attached to the urea site regardless of the size and electronic characteristics. Based on in vivo results, one molecule has been identified as a candidate and additional work such as salt selection, scale-up, etc., are currently underway to take the molecule further through development.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. Analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. METHODS: The species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the Severance Hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. Blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. Identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. Among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. Escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of patients with Enterococcus faecium and K. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. Enterococcus, S. aureus and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. E. coli, Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae and S. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenemresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii increased. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and S. aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and K. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. The bacteremia due to Enterococcus, K. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activities of daptomycin, glycopeptides, linezolid and tigecycline against blood isolates of Gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - In-vitro MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, vancomycin and teicoplanin against Gram-positive bacteria were determined using the broth microdilution method for ten blood isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), including two vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. One strain of VISA was tested in a time-kill synergism assay of daptomycin combined with oxacillin, imipenem, rifampicin and isepamicin. Daptomycin showed excellent in-vitro bactericidal activity against all the isolates tested, with no tolerance or synergism effects when combined with other agents, except with rifampicin against VISA. Vancomycin had better bactericidal activity against MRSA and MSSA than did teicoplanin. Linezolid had the poorest bactericidal activity against the isolates tested, with 100% tolerance by the MSSA and VRE isolates, and 80% tolerance by the MRSA isolates. Tolerance towards tigecycline was exhibited by 40% of the MRSA isolates, 100% of the MSSA and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolates, and 90% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates.
TI  - Daptomycin therapy for invasive Gram-positive bacterial infections in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical improvement is often delayed among children with invasive infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) despite use of standard antimicrobial therapy. Daptomycin, a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic, may prove useful for treatment of these infections in children, but clinical experience is lacking. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of hospitalized children who received daptomycin for treatment of invasive Gram-positive bacterial infections at Children's Medical Center Dallas from December 2003 to March 2007. Bacterial isolates were tested for susceptibility to daptomycin and characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction for staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec A. RESULTS: Sixteen children (10 male; median age, 6.5 years) received daptomycin. Fifteen (94%) children had invasive staphylococcal disease (14, MRSA, of which 13 were community-associated; 1, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus), and 1 had urinary tract infection caused by VRE. Twelve children with disseminated staphylococcal disease had bacteremia for 2-10 days despite therapy with 2 or more of the following: vancomycin, clindamycin, rifampin, aminoglycoside, or linezolid. The addition of daptomycin resulted in bacteriologic cure in 6 of 7 evaluable patients with persistent bacteremia. No adverse events were attributed to daptomycin. Overall, 14 patients improved and were discharged home, and 2 died of complications of their underlying medical conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement after addition of daptomycin to conventional antimicrobial therapy. Further studies are needed to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and effectiveness of daptomycin in infants and children.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Endocarditis in burn patients: clinical and diagnostic considerations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burned patients are at high risk for invasive procedures, bacteremia, and other infectious complications. Previous publications describe high incidence, delayed diagnosis, and high mortality for endocarditis in burned patients, but do not address use of contemporary diagnostic criteria. Further analysis of the clinical presentation and diagnosis may aid in the earlier recognition and decreased mortality of endocarditis in burned patients. METHODS: At a 40 bed burn center, during the period from 1 January 2003 to 1 August 2006, blood culture, electronic inpatient, echocardiographic, and autopsy records were reviewed for cases of endocarditis and persistent bacteremia (blood culture positivity for the same organism separated by 24h). In addition, we reviewed cases of burn-related bacterial endocarditis published in the English language. We compared the clinical and diagnostic aspects of our identified cases with those in the published literature. RESULTS: There were 90 episodes of persistent bacteremia or fungemia in 56 of 1250 patients admitted during the study period. Echocardiography was performed on 19, identifying 4 cases of endocarditis. One additional case of endocarditis was identified post-mortem. Time until echocardiography ranged from 6 to 176 days after onset of bacteremia. Case patient age ranged from 31 to 64 years, and total burn surface area ranged from 34 to 80%. Endocarditis occurred in 0.4% of burn unit admissions and in 8.9% of these patients with persistent bacteremia. Sites involved included the mitral valve (3), tricuspid valve (2), aortic valve (1), and pulmonic valve (1). Pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one case of Enterococcus faecium. Diagnostic clues were minimal. Case mortality was 100%. A literature review revealed 17 publications describing confirmed bacterial endocarditis in burned patients. These cases revealed a predilection for infection by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, a relative paucity of diagnostic clues prior to death, and a trend towards ante-mortem diagnosis and increased survival with use of diagnostic echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and mortality of endocarditis in burned patients remain high. Clinical clues for endocarditis in this cohort are minimal and diagnosis may be delayed. For burned patients with persistent bacteremia, especially S. aureus or P. aeruginosa of unknown source, the diagnosis of endocarditis should be entertained and early echocardiography considered.
TI  - Frequent detection of multidrug-resistant pneumonia-causing bacteria in the pneumonia lung tissues of patients with hematological malignancies.
AB  - Pneumonia is a critical issue during the agonal phase, and often becomes lethal in the absence of pathogen detection. Autopsy is a powerful tool for analyzing the cause of a patient's death, progression of the disease, and the therapeutic response. However, it is frequently limited to the identification of bacterial strains. To elucidate the pathogenesis during the agonal phase of pneumonia, intrapulmonary sputum was harvested by directly inserting a swab into a resected lung, and the bacterial composition was analyzed using both pathological and microbiological techniques from 15 patients with hematological malignancies, and the results were compared with those from 25 patients with other medical and surgical diseases. Among the 54 bacteria strains isolated from the 40 patients, multidrug-resistant strains were significantly more prevalent in hematological group than in other diseases (16/21 versus 11/33, P = .002). Enterococcus faecium was preferentially isolated from the hematological patients, whereas the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was predominantly found in the nonhematological group. Two coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in hematological diseases may be diagnosed as causative bacteria of pneumonia by both bacterial and pathological techniques. Although the results of this study may not be directly applicable for clinical diagnosis, this approach has a potential to become not only a diagnostic method for bacterial pneumonia, but may be also useful for the analysis of multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Transfer of erythromycin-resistance among strains and species of bacteria: plasmid conjugation method in enterococcal isolates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study if the resistance to macrolide in Enterococcus can be transferred between strains, and species of the same and different genera. METHODS: Agar dilution was used to screen 30 enterococcal isolates that were resistant to erythromycin. Conjugation was performed by filter mating method. The 30 donor bacteria included 13 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 16 strains of E. faecium, and 1 strain of E. hirae. The recipient bacteria included 1 strain of E. faecalis sensitive to erythromycin and resistant to tetracycline, and 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus with the MIC against erythromycin of 0.25 approximately 1 microg/ml. Polymerase chain reaction was used to test the existence of ermB gene and the tranposons Tn1545 and Tn917 in the enterococcal isolates before and after filter mating. RESULTS: The transfer rate between different strains and species of the same genus were all 100%. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) against erythromycin of 13 conjugates were both 512 microg/ml, and Tn1545 and Tn917 were found in the ermB gene of 12 conjugates. 17 conjugates were obtained from 16 strains of donor E. faecium and 1 strain of E. hirae with the MIC(50) and MIC(90) both of 512 microg/ml. The ermB gene was found in 16 of the 17 conjugates, and 11 of the 16 conjugates showed the existence of Tn1545 and Tn917, Tn1545 existed in the ermB gene of 4 conjugates, and Tn917 existed in the ermB gene of 1 conjugate. 30 conjugates of Staphylococcus aureus were obtained by plasmid conjugation and transfer with a transfer rate of 100% and the MIC(50) and MIC(90) both of 512 microg/ml. The ermB gene was found in 28 of the 30 conjugates. Both Tn1545 and Tn917 were found in the ermB gene of 23 of the 28 conjugates, Tn1545 was found in the ermB gene of 4 conjugates, and Tn917 was found in the ermB gene of 1 conjugate. CONCLUSION: The resistance to macrolide of Enterococcus, related with the existence of ermB gene and transposons Tn1545 and Tn917, can be transferred between strains and species of same and different genera.
TI  - Experience with linezolid therapy in children with osteoarticular infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excellent oral bioavailability and the Gram-positive antimicrobial spectrum make linezolid an attractive antibiotic for treatment of osteoarticular infections. The clinical efficacy of this drug has not been previously evaluated for Gram-positive osteoarticular infections in children. METHODS: Between July 2003 and June 2006, 13 children who received a linezolid-containing regimen for osteoarticular infections were identified from a hospital pharmacy database. The medical records were reviewed and outcomes with regard to clinical efficacy and safety were analyzed. RESULTS: Eight (61.5%) children were male. Ages ranged from 3 months to 14 years. Nine previously healthy children had acute hematogenous osteoarticular infections involving the pelvis (n = 1) or lower limbs (n = 8). The remaining 4 children had postoperative infections of sternal wounds (n = 2) and fractured lower limbs (n = 2). Causative pathogens included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 11 children, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus in one, and Enterococcus faecium and coagulase-negative staphylococci in one. Surgical debridement was attempted in 9 children and effective antistaphylococcal antibiotics were used in all 13 patients for a median duration of 23 days (range, 5-41 days) before the use of linezolid. Linezolid was administered orally to 10 children as step-down therapy and by the parenteral followed by oral route to 3 children who were intolerant of glycopeptide for a median duration of 20 days (range, 9-36 days). Eleven of the 13 children were cured after management. Two children developed anemia during linezolid therapy. There was no premature cessation of linezolid because of severe adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Linezolid appears to be useful and well tolerated in step-down therapy or compassionate use for pediatric Gram-positive orthopedic infections. A well-designed prospective comparative study is needed to confirm this observation.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of potent heterocyclic oxazolidinones and the identification of RBx 8700.
AB  - Several potent oxazolidinone antibacterial agents were obtained by systematic modification of the linker between the five-membered heterocycle and the piperazinyl ring of RBx 7644 (Ranbezolid, 1) and its thienyl analogue 2, leading to the identification of an expanded spectrum compound RBx 8700 (6b).
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the bactericidal activities of amphibian peptide analogues against multidrug-resistant nosocomial bacterial strains.
AB  - Due to the widespread resistance of bacteria to the available drugs, the discovery of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, and naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising candidates for future therapeutic use. Amphibian skin is one of the richest sources of such AMPs. In the present study we compared the in vitro bactericidal activities of five AMPs from three different species of anurans against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates belonging to species often involved in nosocomial infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii). The peptides tested were temporins A, B, and G from Rana temporaria; the fragment from positions 1 to 18 of esculentin 1b [Esc(1-18)] from Rana esculenta; and bombinin H2 from Bombina variegata. When they were tested in buffer, all the peptides were bactericidal against all bacterial species tested (three strains of each species) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48 microM, with only a few exceptions. The temporins were found to be more active against gram-positive bacteria, especially when they were assayed in human serum; Esc(1-18) showed fast and strong bactericidal activity, within 2 to 20 min, especially against the gram-negative species, which were killed by Esc(1-18) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 microM; bombinin H2 displayed similar bactericidal activity toward all isolates. Interestingly, while the activities of the temporins and bombinin H2 were almost completely inhibited in the presence of 20% human serum, the activity of Esc(1-18) against the gram-negative species was partially preserved in the presence of 40% serum. This property renders this peptide an attractive molecule for use in the development of new compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Distribution of resistant gram-positive organisms across the census regions of the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-positive isolates were collected from 76 medical centers within  the 9 census regions across the United States. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium isolates varied from 45.5% (New England) to 85.3% (East South Central). The lowest concentrations at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) were for tigecycline (0.06-0.12 microg/mL) and for linezolid (2-4 microg/mL). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) varied from 27.4% (New England) to 62.4% (East South Central). All MRSA were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. Penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 23.3% in the Pacific region to 54.5% in the East South Central region. Tigecycline, imipenem, levofloxacin, linezolid, and vancomycin all maintained MIC90 of < or =1 microg/mL against penicillin-nonsusceptible S pneumoniae in vitro, irrespective of region. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the variable rate of antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive organisms in the United States. Tigecycline may make a useful addition to the antimicrobial armamentarium.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of extended 9-glycyl-amido-minocyclines.
AB  - The need for self-protecting polymer or alloy implants resistant to a broad spectrum of bacterial challenges led us to investigate covalent bonding of minocycline (MIN), a tetracycline derivative, to polystyrene beads and to titanium alloy foils by oligoethylene glycol spacers. 9-Hydrazino-acetyl-amido-MIN, and simpler glycylcycline derivatives, retained minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus comparable to MIN. However, PEG-glycyl-amido-MIN showed very low activity. Hence, we coupled 9-hydrazino-acetyl-amido-MIN to the aldehyde termini of oligoethylene glycol spacers bonded to polystyrene and titanium alloy surfaces to form acid-releasable hydrazone linkages. 9-Hydrazino-acetyl-amido-MIN was released from the monolayers more rapidly at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.4.

TI  - Preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  - The aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. One hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. On the basis of these results, 80% alcohol, Octenidine 0.1%, and Chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. The results of the questionnaire revealed that Chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and Octenidine by 7% of the dentists. Using the in vitro model, with the exception of S. aureus, Chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. In contrast, the treatment with Octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. The 80% alcohol was more efficient. No growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. On the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or Octenidine using an incubation time of 15 min with ultrasonication.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.

TI  - Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program Results for 2006: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from 16 countries.
AB  - The Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program has completed its fifth year of monitoring for emerging resistance to linezolid and other Gram-positive active agents on the continents of Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. In 2006, 4216 Gram-positive isolates from 16 nations were submitted for analysis from 6 organism groups including Staphylococcus aureus (54.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (14.6%), enterococci (10.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.4%), viridans group streptococci (5.0%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (7.0%). Linezolid retained potent activity against S. aureus (MIC(50) and MIC(90), 2 microg/mL; 39.8% methicillin resistant) and CoNS (MIC(50) and MIC(90), 1 microg/mL; 74.3% methicillin resistant). Despite endemicity of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (up to 30.0%) in several nations, linezolid inhibited >99% of strains at </=2 microg/mL (modal MIC, 1 microg/mL). Among streptococci, all linezolid MIC values were </=2 microg/mL. Rare instances of linezolid-resistance were detected in enterococci (2 isolates, China and Germany) and CoNS (3 isolates, Italy and Brazil); 2 CoNS and 1 Enterococcus faecium had documented G2576T mutations. Overall, linezolid remained active against 99.88% of tested strains from this global collection.
TI  - Functional and structural properties of CbpA, a collagen-binding protein from Arcanobacterium pyogenes.
AB  - Arcanobacterium pyogenes, an opportunistic pathogen of economically important food animals, is the causative agent of liver abscesses in feedlot cattle, osteomyelitis in turkeys, and pneumonia and arthritis in pigs. Previous studies identified the first A. pyogenes adhesin, CbpA, a protein located on the bacterial surface which has the ability to bind collagen and promotes adhesion to the host cells. The protein has an N-terminal ligand-binding region (region A) and a C-terminal repetitive domain (region B). In this study we found that CbpA bound to almost all the collagen types tested but not to other proteins, and it displayed a propensity to interact with several collagenous peptides derived by CNBr cleavage of type I and II collagens. The K(D) values of CbpA for type I and II collagens and collagen peptides determined by solid-phase binding assay and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were in the range of 1-15 nM. It was also found that CbpA and its A region bound fibronectin, and that collagen and fibronectin interacted with distinct subsites. Anti-CbpA antibodies were effective at inhibiting both binding of isolated CbpA and bacterial adhesion to immobilized collagen, suggesting that CbpA is a functional collagen-binding adhesin. Analysis of the immunological cross-reactivity of CbpA with antibodies against other bacterial collagen-binding proteins indicated that CbpA is immunologically related to ACE from Enterococcus faecalis but not to CNA from Staphylococcus aureus or Acm from Enterococcus faecium. Far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism spectra showed that full-length CbpA and its region A are mainly composed of beta-sheet with only a minor alpha-helical component and that both the proteins have a well-defined tertiary structure.
TI  - New antimicrobial agents as therapy for resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Vancomycin- and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci have emerged as an increasingly problematic cause of hospital-acquired infections. We conducted a literature review of newer antibiotics with activity against vancomycin-resistant and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline have in vitro activity for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and are superior to vancomycin for vancomycin-resistant isolates. Dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin are new glycopeptides that have superior pharmacodynamic properties compared to vancomycin. We review the antibacterial spectrum, clinical indications and contraindications, pharmacologic properties, and adverse events associated with each of these agents. Daptomycin has rapid bactericidal activity for Staphylococcus aureus and is approved for use in bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis. Linezolid is comparable to vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and has pharmacoeconomic advantages given its oral formulation. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is the drug of choice for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections but has no activity against Enterococcus faecalis. Tigecycline has activity against both enterococcus species and MRSA; it is also active against Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes which allows for use in intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections. A review of numerous in vitro and animal model studies shows that interaction between these newer agents and other antistaphylococcal agents for S. aureus are usually indifferent (additive).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from the Asia/Pacific Rim, Europe and Latin and North America collected as part of TEST and the in vitro activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates associated with hospital infections collected from 266 centres in Asia/Pacific Rim (n = 1,947), North America (n = 24,283), Latin America (n = 1,957) and Europe (n = 8,796). METHODS: Isolates were collected from blood, respiratory tract, urine, skin, wound, body fluids and other defined sources between January 2004 and August 2006. Only one isolate per patient was accepted. In vitro MICs for the isolates were determined according to the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: Key organisms collected were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2,902), Enterobacter spp. (n = 5,731), Escherichia coli (n = 6,504), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4,916), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5,128), Serratia marcescens (n = 2,313), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2,701), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1,035) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5,753). Rates of methicillin resistance among S. aureus and of vancomycin resistance among enterococci were highest in North America (2,016/3,809, 52.9% and 571/2,544, 22.4%, respectively) and lowest in Europe (337/1,340, 25.1% and 36/916, 3.9%, respectively). Tigecycline was the only antimicrobial to maintain activity against all Gram-positive isolates (MIC(90) values of <or=0.25 mg/L). Overall, tigecycline and imipenem were the most active (>93% susceptibility in all regions) antimicrobials against the Gram-negative species, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin were the most active against P. aeruginosa. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among K. pneumoniae occurred most frequently in Latin America (124/282, 44.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline is a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is active against the common organisms associated with infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to antimicrobial agents at different ward levels in four north European countries.
AB  - A multicentre susceptibility study was performed on staphylococci and enterococci isolated from patients at 3 different ward levels: primary care centres (PCCs), general hospital wards (GHWs) and intensive care units (ICUs), in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. There was a markedly higher incidence of resistance among CoNS in ICUs compared to GHWs and PCCs. Resistance rates were low among S. aureus isolates and no differences were found between the ward levels. Oxacillin resistance was found among 1.6% of S. aureus and 47% of CoNS isolates. 14% of CoNS and 0.9% of S. aureus isolates were glycopeptide intermediate. The prevalence of E. faecium isolates in this study differed significantly between the ward levels with the lowest prevalence found at PCCs. High level gentamicin resistant (HLGR) enterococci occurred in 11-25% of E. faecium and 6-20% of E. faecalis isolates. The HLGR rate was significantly higher among E. faecalis from hospitalized patients (GHWs and ICUs) compared to patients at PCCs. For enterococcal isolates, no other significant differences in antimicrobial resistance were found between the ward levels. All enterococci were teicoplanin susceptible, but decreased susceptibility to vancomycin was found among 2.0% and 0.6% of the E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates, respectively.
TI  - Marmycins A and B, cytotoxic pentacyclic C-glycosides from a marine sediment-derived actinomycete related to the genus Streptomyces.
AB  - Two new cytotoxic quinones of the angucycline class, marmycins A and B ( 1, 2), were isolated from the culture broth of a marine sediment-derived actinomycete related to the genus Streptomyces. The gross structures and absolute configurations of both compounds were determined by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. Marmycin A ( 1) displayed significant cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines, some at nanomolar concentrations; while compound 2, a chloro analogue of 1, was less potent. For marmycin A ( 1), tumor cell cytotoxicity appeared to coincide with induction of modest apoptosis and arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
TI  - Superbugs in the coming new decade; multidrug resistance and prospects for treatment of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2010.
AB  - New resistance problems have emerged recently among hospital and community-acquired pathogens such as in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hospital-acquired and now community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus are emerging worldwide whereas vancomycin-resistant S. aureus remain extremely rare. Hospital-acquired outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are increasingly reported worldwide. Whereas novel molecules are being developed for treating Gram-positive infections, difficult to non possible-to-treat pandrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections may become a therapeutic challenge soon.
TI  - LEADER surveillance program results for 2006: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from the United States (50 medical centers).
AB  - Surveillance for emerging linezolid resistance among commonly occurring Gram-positive pathogens in the United States began with the 2002 ZAAPS program and more recently (2004) expanded as the LEADER program. The 2006 LEADER program processed 5374 strains from 50 medical centers (100 per site) located within the 9 US census regions; species and number tested by broth microdilution (% linezolid susceptible) included Staphylococcus aureus (2913, >99.9), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNSs) (808, 98.4), enterococci (547, 97.4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (546, 100.0), viridans group streptococci (189, 100.0), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (371, 100.0). In addition to 1 linezolid-nonsusceptible S. aureus, 3 strains were daptomycin-nonsusceptible, 4 were quinupristin/dalfopristin-intermediate, 2 were vancomycin-intermediate (vancomycin MIC values, 4 mug/mL), and all were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Among the linezolid-resistant isolates (1 S. aureus, 13 CoNSs, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, and 10 Enterococcus faecium isolates), all but 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates had the G2567T mutation. Overall, 99.55% of the tested 2006 LEADER program isolates remained susceptible to linezolid at current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints.
TI  - Gram-positive bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients: incidence, risk factors, and impact on survival.
AB  - The objective of the study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and survival of gram-positive bloodstream infections (GP-BSI(s)) among liver transplant recipients during the first year after transplantation. Between October 2000 and September 2006, 42 episodes of GP-BSI(s) occurred in 205 patients with an overall incidence of 0.20 episodes/patient. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in 45.2% of cases, Enterococcus species in 42.9% (E faecalis, eight; E faecium, seven; E avium, two; E gallinarum, one) and Staphylococcus aureus in 11.9%. Retransplantation was the only independent risk factor for GP-BSI (odds ratio [OR], 0.253; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.089 to 0.715; P = .009). Thirty-day mortality rate was 28.5% and S aureus infections were related to a poorer outcome. It is noteworthy that all the isolates of S aureus were methicillin-resistant. Ampicillin was inactive against all the strains of E faecium and 50% of E avium isolates, but active against all E faecalis and E gallinarum strains. All the isolates were glycopeptide-susceptible. No significant differences in mortality rate were observed in relation to sex, etiologies of end-stage liver disease, cytomegalovirus infection/reinfection, type of donor, rejection, or retransplantation. GP-BSI, the only independent risk factor for death (OR, 0.262; 95% CI, 0.106 to 0.643; P = .003), reduced the survival rate by 26% in the first year posttransplant. In conclusion, GP-BSI(s) impact significantly on morbidity and mortality posttransplant, particularly among retransplantations. Control measures are required to reduce the incidence of GP-BSI(s) in liver transplant recipients. These findings must be considered when empirical antimicrobial therapy is indicated while awaiting blood-culture results.
TI  - Many fructosamine 3-kinase homologues in bacteria are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases potentially involved in protein deglycation.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to identify the function of bacterial homologues of  fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K), a mammalian enzyme responsible for the removal of fructosamines from proteins. FN3K homologues were identified in approximately 200 (i.e. approximately 27%) of the sequenced bacterial genomes. In 11 of these genomes, from phylogenetically distant bacteria, the FN3K homologue was immediately preceded by a low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (LMW-PTP) homologue, which is therefore probably functionally related to the FN3K homologue. Five bacterial FN3K homologues (from Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Staphylococcus aureus and Thermus thermophilus) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified and their kinetic properties investigated. Four were ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases acting best on free lysine and cadaverine derivatives, but not on ribulosamines bound to the alpha amino group of amino acids. They also phosphorylated protein-bound ribulosamines or erythrulosamines, but not protein-bound fructosamines, therefore having properties similar to those of mammalian FN3K-related protein. The E. coli FN3K homologue (YniA) was inactive on all tested substrates. The LMW-PTP of T. thermophilus, which forms an operon with an FN3K homologue, and an LMW-PTP of S. aureus (PtpA) were overexpressed in E. coli, purified and shown to dephosphorylate not only protein tyrosine phosphates, but protein ribulosamine 5-phosphates as well as free ribuloselysine 5-phosphate and erythruloselysine 4-phosphate. These LMW-PTPs were devoid of ribulosamine 3-phosphatase activity. It is concluded that most bacterial FN3K homologues are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases. They may serve, in conjunction with a phosphatase, to deglycate products of glycation formed from ribose 5-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate.
TI  - Gram-positive microorganisms isolated from patients treated in the Department and Clinic of Rehabilitation at Rydygier Medical University in Bydgoszcz, Poland, 2000-2001.
AB  - Background. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the occurrence of Gram-positive microorganisms isolated from patients hospitalized in the Department and Clinic of Rehabilitation at the Rydygier Medical University in Bydgoszcz. Materials and methods. The material analyzed consisted of 533 clinical samples collected from patients hospitalized in 2000-2001. The study included 485 Gram-positive bacterial strains isolated from clinical material. Morphological characteristics provided the basis for the identification of bacteria. The species were identified by using API 20 STREP and API STAPH tests (bioMerieux). The isolates were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk-diffusion method. Results. The most often isolated bacteria were Enterococcus spp. (46,8%) and Staphylococcus spp. (31,5%), followed by Corynebacterium spp. (9,1%) and Streptococcus spp. (6,6%). The most frequently identified Enterococcus species were E. faecalis (92,9%) and E. faecium (7,1%). All the Enterococcus strains were susceptible to glycopeptides. More than 90% of the Enterococus isolates were sensitive to nitrofurantoine, about 44% to high concentrations of gentamycin, 17,9% to ciprofloxacin. During this period, and S. simulans, and 21 strains of S. auerus (46,7%). 92% of all the tested CNS strains (80%) than in the S. aureus isolates (10%). Conclusions. The most frequently observed bacterium was E. faecalis, which showed significant resistance to quinolones and to high level aminoglycosides. The CNS strains showed a high level of resistance to methicilline. All these strains were susceptible to glycopeptides.
TI  - Enterococci and streptococci.
AB  - Besides Staphylococcus aureus, other Gram-positive bacteria have become multidrug-resistant and cause therapeutic problems, particularly amongst hospitalised patients. The acquisition of vancomycin resistance by strains of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis is of particular concern and has resulted in treatment failures. Some of the infections caused by these bacteria do respond to treatment with new antibiotics that have been released in the last few years, however more options are required as not all enterococci are inherently susceptible and resistance is beginning to emerge amongst those that were susceptible. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics is also emerging in Streptococcus spp., particularly to the tetracyclines and macrolides. In both genera, multiresistant strains spread between patients and between hospitals. In the laboratory, these bacteria show considerable susceptibility to tigecycline, with little propensity to develop resistance, indicating that tigecycline could assume an important role in controlling infections caused by these Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Lactic acidosis after treatment with linezolid.
AB  - Linezolid is currently indicated to treat vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. We report a case of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis during treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia after mitral valve replacement and permanent pacemaker implantation. We also review the current literature describing other cases of linezolid-associated hyperlactatemia.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. Overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.015-0.5mg/L, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and MR staphylococci. Tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, with MICs for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) of 0.25 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, being more active than linezolid (MIC(90)=2 mg/L) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/L, respectively). Molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(M), erm(B) and erm(C) in Streptococcus agalactiae; tet(O), variably associated with different erm genes, in Streptococcus pyogenes; vanA, tet(M) and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecalis, and vanA and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecium. All the MRSA strains harboured SCCmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(K) with tet(M) genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. These results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a MIC(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/L both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Predicting microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop an equation that accurately predicts microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments at constantly rising heating rates (from 0.5 to 5 degrees C/min) in media with different pH values (4.0 or 7.4). The survival curves of all bacteria (Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Senftenberg 775W, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) tested under isothermal treatments were nearly linear. For the most heat-resistant microorganism (E. faecium), the estimated DT-values at pH 7.4 were at least 100 times those of the second most thermotolerant microorganism (Salmonella Senftenberg 775W). The heat resistance of E. faecium was up to 30 times lower at pH 4.0 than at pH 7.4. However, E. faecium was still the most heat-resistant microorganism under nonisothermal treatments at both pH values. Inactivation under nonisothermal conditions was not accurately estimated from heat resistance parameters of isothermal treatments when microbial adaptation or sensibilization occurred during the heating up lag phases. The under-prediction of the number of survivors might be greater than 15 log CFU within the nonisothermal treatment conditions investigated. Therefore, the nonisothermal survival curves of the most heat-resistant microorganisms were fitted with the following equation: log S(t) = -(t/delta)P. This equation accurately described the survival curves of all the bacteria tested. We observed a linear relationship between the log of the scale parameter (delta) and the log of the heating rate. A p value characteristic of each microorganism and pH tested was calculated. Two equations capable of predicting the inactivation rate of all bacteria tested under nonisothermal treatments at pH 7.4, 5.5, or 4.0 were developed. The model was evaluated in skim milk and apple juice. The results of this study could be used to help minimize public health risks and to extend the shelf life of those foods requiring long heating up lag phases during processing.
TI  - [PCR MP (PCR melting profile) technique--possibilities of application in epidemiological studies].
AB  - The performance and convenience of a PCR melting profile (PCR MP) technique based on using low denaturation temperatures during ligation mediated PCR (LM PCR) of bacterial DNA is shown. We found that PCR MP technique is a rapid method that offers good discriminatory power, excellent reproducibility and may be applied for epidemiological studies. Results from strain genotyping illustrate that PCR MP is useful for the study of intraspecific genetic relatedness of strains and is as effective in discriminating closely related strains as the PFGE method, which is currently considered to be the gold standard for epidemiological studies. The usefulness of the PCR MP for molecular typing was shown for clinical strains of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium VRE and Stapylococcus aureus.
TI  - AM-7359--a novel oxazolidinone with low resistance potential and potent activity  against drug resistant pathogens.
AB  - AM-7359 is a member of a novel series of oxazolidinones with antimicrobial activity against pathogens resistant to multiple antibiotics. Potent antibiotics with limited drug cross resistance to current therapeutic agents are needed for the treatment of drug resistant pathogens. This study investigated the resistance development to linezolid (LZD) and AM-7359 by key pathogens and the degree of cross resistance between these two oxazolidinones. Both AM-7359 and LZD, demonstrates a low frequency of resistance development. After 30 passages and selection for resistant development of four different Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococus faecium strains the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for AM-7359 was 1 <or= microg/ml compared to 32 to 256 microg/ml for LZD. In cross resistance studies AM-7359 demonstrated MICs of 0.5 to 1 microg/ml against the resistant strains selected on LZD. LZD MICs against the resistant strains selected on AM-7359 were 32-64 microg/ml.
TI  - Synthesis of the guanacastepene A-B hydrazulene ring system through photochemical ring transposition.
AB  - The A-B hydrazulene ring system of the guanacastepenes has been synthesised using a photochemical ring transposition of a 6-6 bicycle.
TI  - Structural basis for streptogramin B resistance in Staphylococcus aureus by virginiamycin B lyase.
AB  - The streptogramin combination therapy of quinupristin-dalfopristin (Synercid) is  used to treat infections caused by bacterial pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. However, the effectiveness of this therapy is being compromised because of an increased incidence of streptogramin resistance. One of the clinically observed mechanisms of resistance is enzymatic inactivation of the type B streptogramins, such as quinupristin, by a streptogramin B lyase, i.e., virginiamycin B lyase (Vgb). The enzyme catalyzes the linearization of the cyclic antibiotic via a cleavage that requires a divalent metal ion. Here, we present crystal structures of Vgb from S. aureus in its apoenzyme form and in complex with quinupristin and Mg2+ at 1.65- and 2.8-A resolution, respectively. The fold of the enzyme is that of a seven-bladed beta-propeller, although the sequence reveals no similarity to other known members of this structural family. Quinupristin binds to a large depression on the surface of the enzyme, where it predominantly forms van der Waals interactions. Validated by site-directed mutagenesis studies, a reaction mechanism is proposed in which the initial abstraction of a proton is facilitated by a Mg2+ -linked conjugated system. Analysis of the Vgb-quinupristin structure and comparison with the complex between quinupristin and its natural target, the 50S ribosomal subunit, reveals features that can be exploited for developing streptogramins that are impervious to Vgb-mediated resistance.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of oleanolic acid from Salvia officinalis and related compounds on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
AB  - An extract from Salvia officinalis (Sage) leaves showed antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We isolated the effective compound and identified it as oleanolic acid, a triterpenoid. We also tested antimicrobial activity of similar triterpenoids, ursolic acid, uvaol, betulinic acid and betulin. We found that ursolic acid also showed antimicrobial activity against VRE. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were 8 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. These two compounds also showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These compounds showed bactericidal activity against VRE at least for 48 h when added at concentrations that were two-times higher than their MICs.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive bacterial isolates from the Asia-Pacific region and an in vitro evaluation of the bactericidal activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin: a SENTRY Program Report (2003-2004).
AB  - Medical centres in eight countries in the Asia-Pacific region provided 2391 isolates for the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program during 2003-2004 to determine their susceptibility to several antimicrobial classes, including daptomycin. Daptomycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined for 120 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, which included wild-type (WT) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (hetero-vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA)). Oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were much less susceptible to the other tested agents compared with oxacillin-susceptible strains. Vancomycin resistance was higher among Enterococcus faecium (10.3%) than Enterococcus faecalis (0.4%), and macrolide resistance was high both for beta-haemolytic (17.7%) and viridans group (48.7%) streptococci. Daptomycin (MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=0.5-1mg/L) was two-fold more potent than vancomycin, with >99% susceptibility when tested against staphylococci. All tested isolates of E. faecalis (MIC(90)=2mg/L) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(90)=0.5mg/L) were susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin MIC and MBC values were slightly higher for the hVISA isolates compared with WT-MRSA, with MBC/MIC ratios of only 1-2 for both groups. The MBC/MIC ratio for vancomycin was often greater when tested against these strains, particularly hVISA. In contrast, teicoplanin MBC/MIC ratios were significantly higher, with many of the strains showing values consistent with tolerance (>or=32). Daptomycin was demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity when tested against Gram-positive isolates collected from Asia-Pacific countries, including hVISA strains.
TI  - In-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. It forms a stable inhibitory complex with Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In recent studies of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, the ceftobiprole MIC(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/L). For MRSA, MIC(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/L). MICs for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant Streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/L. Ceftobiprole is active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90) = 4 mg/L), but not generally active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90) > 16 mg/L). Ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against Gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. However, recent data show activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of ceftazidime. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class A non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class C beta-lactamases. Ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of AmpC beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by AmpC beta-lactamase. Studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by MRSA, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. It was also efficacious in murine infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria with MIC values < or =2 mg/L. The broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of suspected Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, including those caused by MRSA.
TI  - Comparative review of the carbapenems.
AB  - The carbapenems are beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with an exceptionally broad  spectrum of activity. Older carbapenems, such as imipenem, were often susceptible to degradation by the enzyme dehydropeptidase-1 (DHP-1) located in renal tubules and required co-administration with a DHP-1 inhibitor such as cilastatin. Later additions to the class such as meropenem, ertapenem and doripenem demonstrated increased stability to DHP-1 and are administered without a DHP-1 inhibitor. Like all beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, carbapenems act by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Carbapenems are stable to most beta-lactamases including AmpC beta-lactamases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Resistance to carbapenems develops when bacteria acquire or develop structural changes within their PBPs, when they acquire metallo-beta-lactamases that are capable of rapidly degrading carbapenems, or when changes in membrane permeability arise as a result of loss of specific outer membrane porins. Carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem) possess broad-spectrum in vitro activity, which includes activity against many Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria; carbapenems lack activity against Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Compared with imipenem, meropenem and doripenem, the spectrum of activity of ertapenem is more limited primarily because it lacks activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp. Imipenem, meropenem and doripenem have in vivo half lives of approximately 1 hour, while ertapenem has a half-life of approximately 4 hours making it suitable for once-daily administration. As with other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the most important pharmacodynamic parameter predicting in vivo efficacy is the time that the plasma drug concentration is maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T>MIC). Imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem have been studied in comparative clinical trials establishing their efficacy in the treatment of a variety of infections including complicated intra-abdominal infections, skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections, meningitis (meropenem only) and febrile neutropenia. The current role for imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem in therapy remains for use in moderate to severe nosocomial and polymicrobial infections. The unique antimicrobial spectrum and pharmacokinetic properties of ertapenem make it more suited to treatment of community-acquired infections and outpatient intravenous antimicrobial therapy than for the treatment of nosocomial infections. Doripenem is a promising new carbapenem with similar properties to those of meropenem, although it appears to have more potent in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa than meropenem. Clinical trials are required to establish the efficacy and safety of doripenem in moderate to severe infections, including nosocomial infections.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of a small library of nojirimycin-derived bicyclic iminosugars.
AB  - Novel nojirimycin-derived bicyclic structures, containing cyclic carbamate, urea  and guanidine moieties have been synthesised starting from suitably protected alpha-C-vinylnojirimycin and alpha-C-allylnojirimycin, respectively, and their biological activity against different glycosidases and as antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - With the incidence of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. These compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, S. albus, Streptococcus enteridis and S. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (MIC: 3.13-6.25 mug/mL). The position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except S. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely S. albus, S. enteridis.

TI  - Daptomycin antimicrobial activity tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated in European medical centers (2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide with potent activity and broad spectrum against Gram-positive bacteria currently used for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacteremia, including right sided endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of this compound and selected comparator agents tested against clinical strains of staphylococci and enterococci collected in European medical centers in 2005. METHODS: A total of 4,640 strains from 23 medical centers located in 10 European countries, Turkey and Israel (SENTRY Program platform) were tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and interpretative criteria. Mueller-Hinton broth was supplemented to 50 mg/L Ca++ for testing daptomycin. Results for oxacillin (methicillin)-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus varied from 2.1% in Sweden to 42.5% in the United Kingdom (UK) and 54.7% in Ireland (29.1% overall), while vancomycin resistance rates varied from 0.0% in France, Sweden and Switzerland to 66.7% in the UK and 71.4% in Ireland among Enterococcus faecium (17.9% overall). All S. aureus strains were inhibited at daptomycin MIC of 1 mg/L (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible) and only one coagulase-negative staphylococci strain (0.1%) showed an elevated (>1 mg/L) daptomycin MIC value (4 mg/L). Among E. faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mg/L; 100% susceptible) the highest daptomycin MIC value was 2 mg/L; while among E. faecium (MIC50/90, 2/4 mg/L; 100% susceptible) the highest MIC result was 4 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin showed excellent in vitro activity against staphylococci and enterococci collected in European medical centers in 2005 and resistance to oxacillin, vancomycin or quinupristin/dalfopristin did not compromise its activity overall against these pathogens. Based on these results and those of previous publications, daptomycin appears to be an excellent therapeutic option for serious infections caused by oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in Europe.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - In vitro effect of the presence of human albumin or human serum on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin against strains with the main resistance phenotypes in Gram-positives.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bactericidal activity depends on antibiotic-bacteria couples, resistance phenotype and theoretically on protein binding. This work explores the influence of protein binding on the bactericidal activity of two antibiotics, daptomycin versus vancomycin, that exhibit, respectively, different C(max) (56 versus 25.5 mg/L), protein binding (91.7% versus 36.9%) and thus theoretical free-drug fractions (4.7 versus 16.1 mg/L). METHODS: The effect of the presence of physiological concentrations of human albumin (4 g/dL) or human serum (90%) on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin was studied against Gram-positive isolates with troublesome resistance phenotypes [multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate MRSA (MRSA-hVI) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium]. Killing curves (final inocula of approximately 10(7) cfu/mL) were performed using daptomycin and vancomycin concentrations similar to the C(max) obtained in serum. RESULTS: Daptomycin was rapidly bactericidal (> or =3 log(10) initial inocula reduction) against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, regardless of the strain tested or the presence of albumin or human serum (that slightly delayed bactericidal activity). Against vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant enterococci, daptomycin exhibited rapid bactericidal activity, delayed to 8 and 24 h, respectively, by human albumin. Vancomycin exhibited much slower bactericidal activity against MDRSP and methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus, but was never bactericidal against MRSA-hVI and vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant E. faecium. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin exhibited rapid bactericidal activity against the strains of the three Gram-positive species tested, regardless of resistance phenotype or the presence of physiological concentrations of albumin.

TI  - Faropenem: review of a new oral penem.
AB  - Faropenem medoxomil is a new orally administered penem antibiotic. Its chiral tetrahydrofuran substituent at position C2 is responsible for its improved chemical stability and reduced CNS effects, compared with imipenem. Faropenem demonstrates broad-spectrum in vitro antimicrobial activity against many Gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, and is resistant to hydrolysis by nearly all beta-lactamases, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and AmpC beta-lactamases. However, faropenem is not active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative (not vs placebo) clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs) have demonstrated that faropenem medoxomil has equivalent efficacy and safety compared with cefuroxime, clarithromycin, azithromycin, amoxicillin, cefpodoxime and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The evidence supports faropenem medoxomil as a promising new oral beta-lactam with proven efficacy and safety for the treatment of a variety of community-acquired infections. However, the US FDA recently rejected faropenem for all four indications stating that the clinical trials in ABS and AECB should have been performed versus a placebo. In the CAP studies, the FDA stated that they could not be certain of the validity of the study population actually having the disease and for uSSSI, the FDA stated that only a single trial was not adequate evidence of efficacy for this indication.
TI  - A new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  - The use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. A marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from Eal fish of Baluchistan coast of Pakistan. This strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. In this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of P. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. Based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio aliginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter faecium but it is not active against G streptococci, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. Minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg mL(-1) and for Gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - A comparison of available and investigational antibiotics for complicated skin infections and treatment-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus.
AB  - This article compares vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecyline, dalbavancin, telavancin, ceftobiprole, oritavancin, and ramoplanin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), enterococcus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is administered intravenously, and is the mainstay of treatment for MRSA and cSSSI. While not available in the U.S., teicoplanin, another glycopeptide antibiotic, can be administered intramuscularly and has simpler dosing and monitoring requirements than vancomycin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin treats vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infections but inhibits cytochrome P450 A3P4, and has only modest activity against MRSA pneumonia. Daptomycin effectively treats cSSSI but not pneumonia caused by MRSA, and is effective against all strains of Staphylococcus. Linezolid, available orally and intravenously, is approved to treat community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, cSSSI, and infections caused by MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci including infections with concurrent bacteraemia and VREE Tigecycline, a glycylcycline derived from minocycline, has been approved by the FDA to treat cSSSI and complicated intraabdominal infections, and might be effective against Acinetobacter baumannii; its primary side effect is digestive upset. Dalbavancin, effective against MRSA and administered intravenously once weekly, possesses coverage similar to vancomycin. Telavancin deploys multiple mechanisms of action and is effective against MRSA and Gram-positive bacteria resistant to vancomycin. Ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin effective against MRSA, has few side effects. Oritavancin demonstrates similar activity to vancomycin but possesses extended activity against vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus and enterococci. Ramoplanin, a macrocyclic depsipeptide, is unstable in the bloodstream but can be taken orally to treat Clostridium difficile colitis.
TI  - Electrochemical detection of harmful algae and other microbial contaminants in coastal waters using hand-held biosensors.
AB  - Standard methods to identify microbial contaminants in the environment are slow,  laborious, and can require specialized expertise. This study investigated electrochemical detection of microbial contaminants using commercially available, hand-held instruments. Electrochemical assays were developed for a red tide dinoflagellate (Karenia brevis), fecal-indicating bacteria (Enterococcus spp.), markers indicative of human sources of fecal pollution (human cluster Bacteroides and the esp gene of Enterococcus faecium), bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus), and a viral pathogen (adenovirus). For K. brevis, two assay formats (Rapid PCR-Detect and Hybrid PCR-Detect) were tested and both provided detection limits of 10 genome equivalents for DNA isolated from K. brevis culture and amplified by PCR. Sensitivity with coastal water samples was sufficient to detect K. brevis that was "present" (<or=1000 cells/l) without yielding false positive results and the electrochemical signal was significantly different than for samples containing cells at "medium" concentrations (100,000 to<10(6)cells/l). Detection of K. brevis RNA was also shown. Multi-target capability was demonstrated with an 8-plex assay for bacterial and viral targets using isolated DNA, natural beach water spiked with human feces, and water and sediments collected from New Orleans, Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina. Furthermore, direct detection of dinoflagellate and bacterial DNA was achieved using lysed cells rather than extracted nucleic acids, allowing streamlining of the process. The methods presented can be used to rapidly (3-5h) screen environmental water samples for the presence of microbial contaminants and have the potential to be integrated into semi-automated detection platforms.
TI  - Semisynthetic approaches to laspartomycin analogues.
AB  - Laspartomycin C (1), a lipopeptide antibiotic related to amphomycin, consists of  a cyclic peptide core and an aspartic acid unit external to the core and linking this to a C15-2,3-unsaturated fatty acid. This was reported initially to be active against Staphylococcus aureus, and more recent studies have shown that it is active against VRE, VISA, and MRSA isolates. The enzymatic cleavage of the fatty acid tail was accomplished with a deacylase produced by Actinoplanes utahensis and resulted in two peptides, designated Peptide 1 and Peptide 2. Semisynthetic derivatives of both peptides have been made, and the principal requirement for biological activity appears to be the presence of an acylaspartic acid.
TI  - Characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci from Colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci recovered from Colombian hospitals. METHODS: The resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1679), Staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (175), and Enterococcus spp (123). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for erythromycin (ERY) and clindamycin (CLI), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. RESULTS: Resistance to ERY and CLI was 3.3% and 2.3% for S. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for S. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ERY resistance was 62% in Enterococcus faecalis and 82% in Enterococcus faecium. The MLS(B)-type accounted for 71% of S. pneumoniae and 100% of MRSA. The erm(A) gene was prevalent in MRSA, erm(B) in S. pneumoniae and enterococci, and erm(C) in CoNS isolates. Efflux pump genes (mef(A) genes) were mostly identified in S. pneumoniae (24%). The most common genotype amongst ERY-resistant pneumococci was the Spain(6B)-2 clone. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of macrolide resistance is low in Colombian pneumococci and high in MRSA (cMLS(B)-type).
TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - Potentiation of antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides by carnosol from Salvia officinalis.
AB  - We found that a crude extract from Salvia officinalis (sage) reduced the minimum  inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of aminoglycosides in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We isolated the effective compound from the extract and identified it as carnosol, one of diterpenoids. Carnosol showed a weak antimicrobial activity, and greatly reduced the MICs of various aminoglycosides (potentiated the antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides) and some other types of antimicrobial agents in VRE. Carnosic acid, a related compound, showed the similar activity. The effect of carnosol and carnosic acid with gentamicin was synergistic.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - A new class of anti-MRSA and anti-VRE agents: preparation and antibacterial activities of indole-containing compounds.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic factors influencing emergence of resistance to linezolid in an in vitro model.
AB  - Emerging resistance threatens the usefulness of linezolid for the treatment of severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. Optimal pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) indices have been described for the antimicrobial efficacy of linezolid (area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h at steady state divided by the MIC, >100; the cumulative percentage of a 24-h period that the drug concentration exceeds the MIC under steady-state PK conditions, >85). The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of these PK/PD indices on the development of resistance to linezolid by using an in vitro PK/PD model. Four dosage regimens were simulated over 72 h (two intermittent bolus regimens of 600 mg every 12 h [q12h] and 120 mg q12h and two continuous-infusion regimens of 120 mg/24 h and 30 mg/24 h) against four reference strains: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA), vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE). Linezolid concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Changes in susceptibility were characterized by pre- and posttreatment MIC measurements and population analysis profiles (PAPs). The linezolid concentrations that were achieved closely matched those that were targeted. The simulation with 600 mg q12h provided a >3-log10 reduction in the number of CFU/ml for all four strains, as did the 120-mg-q12h regimen for hVISA and VISA and the 30-mg/24-h continuous infusion for VRE and VISA. After 72 h of exposure to the 120-mg/24-h continuous-infusion simulation, the area under the PAP curve for all strains increased substantially (40 to 178%); increases in the MICs for the MRSA and hVISA strains were observed. The results demonstrate that PK/PD considerations are important in optimizing both antibacterial activity and the development of resistance to linezolid. The potential for resistance development appears to be higher when a constant concentration is maintained in the vicinity of the MIC of the bacteria.
TI  - Interplay among folding, sequence, and lipophilicity in the antibacterial and hemolytic activities of alpha/beta-peptides.
AB  - Host-defense peptides inhibit bacterial growth but manifest relatively little toxicity toward eukaryotic cells. Many host-defense peptides adopt alpha-helical conformations in which cationic side chains and lipophilic side chains are segregated to distinct regions of the molecular surface ("globally amphiphilic helices"). Several efforts have been made to develop unnatural oligomers that mimic the selective antibacterial activity of host-defense peptides; these efforts have focused on the creation of molecules that are globally amphiphilic in the preferred conformation. One such endeavor, from our laboratories, focused on helix-forming alpha/beta-peptides, i.e., oligomers containing a 1:1 pattern of alpha- and beta-amino acid residues in the backbone [Schmitt, M. A.; Weisblum, B.; Gellman, S. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 6848-6849]. We found, unexpectedly, that the most favorable biological activity profile was displayed by a "scrambled" sequence, which was designed not to be able to form a globally amphiphilic helix. Here we report new data, involving an expanded set of alpha/beta-peptides, from experiments designed to elucidate the origins of this surprising result. In addition, we evaluate the susceptibility of alpha/beta-peptides to proteolytic degradation. Our results support the hypothesis that the ability to adopt a globally amphiphilic helical conformation is not a prerequisite for selective antibacterial activity. This conclusion represents a significant advance in our understanding of the relationship among molecular composition, conformation, and biological activity. Our results should therefore influence the design of other unnatural oligomers intended to function as antibacterial agents.
TI  - In vitro activity of the oxazolidinone RWJ-416457 against linezolid-resistant and -susceptible staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  - RWJ-416457, a novel oxazolidinone, had modal MICs of 0.5 to 1 microg/ml for linezolid-susceptible staphylococci and enterococci, versus linezolid MICs for these organisms of 1 or 2 microg/ml. RWJ-416457 MICs for mutants with 23S rRNA mutations were 2 to 32 microg/ml, versus linezolid MICs of 8 to 64 microg/ml; actual values reflected the proportion of gene copies mutated.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium using human peak free serum drug concentrations.
AB  - The bactericidal activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid  at human peak free serum concentrations (C(max,free)) were determined against Staphylococcus aureus (one methicillin-susceptible and two methicillin-resistant strains), Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (one vancomycin-susceptible and one vancomycin-resistant strain of each). Daptomycin was rapidly bactericidal against 7/7 strains at C(max,free) of 22.0 mg/L (corresponding to 63% protein binding) and against 3/7 strains at 4.8 mg/L (corresponding to 92% protein binding). Vancomycin (18.0 mg/L) was bactericidal against only two strains. Both teicoplanin (4.5 mg/L) and linezolid (10.4 mg/L) were consistently bacteriostatic. Daptomycin is a useful option for the treatment of Gram-positive infections owing to its strong bactericidal activity.
TI  - A review of the current place of glycopeptides in turkish medical practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in Turkey. METHODS: A search of both the English- and Turkish-language literature indexed on MEDLINE, Ulakbim (Turkey), and Pleksus (Turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their Turkish-language counterparts. The complete texts of the articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of Gulhane Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey. Articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. Articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in Turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. RESULTS: Staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in Turkish hospitals. Studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were Staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. In Turkey, S aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing threat in the community. While the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. In the studies reviewed, older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the S aureus isolates. Alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. In recent Turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (QD), and daptomycin have had positive results. As in the S aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the CoNS group of pathogens. The possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. Quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, TMP/SMX, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. Although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate S aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. Current studies in Turkey have found that Enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of Enterococcus faecium. Initial studies performed with linezolid, QD, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. Approximately 8% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in Turkey. However, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (CNS). Resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in Turkey range between 2% and 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS: In Turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to CNS infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. However, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. If a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. However, new molecules such as linezolid, QD, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: VIRA STUDY 2006].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by human Lactococcus lactis and Pediococccus acidilactici isolates.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from human intestine. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 111 LAB were isolated from human adult stool and screened for their bacteriocin production. Neutralized cell-free supernatants from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis MM19 and Pediococcus acidilactici MM33 showed antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobials in the supernatant from a culture of L. lactis inhibited Enterococcus faecium, various species of Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus aureus; while those in the supernatant from a culture of P. acidilactici inhibited Enterococcus spp., some lactobacilli and various serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes. The antimicrobial metabolites were heat-stable and were active over a pH range of 2-10. The antimicrobial activities of the supernatants of both bacteria were inhibited by many proteases but not by catalase. The plate overlay assay allowed an approximation of size between 3.5 and 6 kDa for both antimicrobial substances. CONCLUSIONS: As the antagonistic factor(s) produced by L. lactis MM19 and P. acidilactici MM33 were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, it could be hypothesized that bacteriocins were involved in the inhibitory activities. Inhibition spectrum and biochemical analysis showed that these bacteria produced two distinct bacteriocins. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We are the first to isolate bacteriocin-producing strains of Pediococcus and Lactococcus from human intestine. These strains might be useful for control of enteric pathogens.
TI  - [Synthesis and antibacterial activities of 7-{4-[2-[2-substituted-4-((5S)-5-acetylaminomethyl-2-oxo-oxazolidin-3-yl)}-phenyl ] -ethyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-fluoroquinolones].
AB  - AIM: To find out new oxazolidinone-fluoroquinolone derivatives with high antibacterial activity. METHODS: Some 7-{4-[2-[2-substituted-4-((5S)-5- acetylaminomethyl-2-oxo-oxazolidin-3-yl)-phenyl]-ethyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-fluoroqui nolones were designed and synthesized, and their antibacterial activities were tested in vitro. RESULTS: Twenty target compounds were obtained and their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and MS. The target compounds had high antibacterial activities in vitro, especially, the activity of compound 22 against Enterococcus faecium was 16-fold and 64-fold more potent than that of linezolid and norfloxacin, respectively, and its MIC value against Staphylococcus aureus was 4-fold lower than that of linezolid. CONCLUSION: The oxazolidinone-fluoroquinolone derivatives improved the antibacterial activities.
TI  - Use of linezolid in children: an overview of recent advances.
AB  - Linezolid is the first member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Linezolid is showing great promise currently for the treatment of multiresistant gram-positive bacterial infections, especially complicated skin infections, catheter-induced bacteremia or nosocomial pneumonia both in the community and in a hospital setting, in children and in adults. Although most recent reports are favorable and anticipatory of a more extensive use of linezolid in appropriately selected pediatric population groups in the near future, following treatment failure of conventional antimicrobial agents, more clinical trials are, however, required to investigate the safety profile and tolerability of this new antibiotic in the pediatric population.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Comparison of routine prophylaxis with vancomycin or cefazolin for femoral neck fracture surgery: microbiological and clinical outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on the emergence of vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus and the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) after vancomycin or cefazolin prophylaxis for femoral neck fracture surgery. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A hospital with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage. PATIENTS: All patients admitted with a femoral neck fracture from March 1, 2004 through February 28, 2005 were prospectively identified and screened for MRSA and vancomycin-resistant (VRE) carriage at admission and at day 7. Deep incisional and organ/space SSIs were also recorded. RESULTS: Of 263 patients included in the study, 152 (58%) received cefazolin and 106 (40%) received vancomycin. At admission, the prevalence of MRSA carriage was 6.8%; it was 12% among patients with risk factors and 2.2% among patients with no risk factors (P=.002). At day 7 after surgery, there were 6 patients (2%) who had hospital-acquired MRSA, corresponding to 0.7% in the cefazolin group and 5% in the vancomycin group (P=.04); none of the MRSA isolates were resistant to glycopeptides. The rate of VRE carriage at admission was 0.4%. Three patients (1%) had acquired carriage of VRE (1 had E. faecium and 2 had E. faecalis); all 3 were in the cefazolin group (2% of patients) and none in the vancomycin group (P=.27). Eight SSIs (3%) occurred, 4% in the cefazolin group and 2% in the vancomycin group (P=.47). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study demonstrates that cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis have similar impacts on the emergence of glycopeptide-resistant pathogens. Neither MRSA infection nor increased rates of SSI with other bacteria were observed in the vancomycin group, suggesting that a larger multicenter study should be initiated.
TI  - Appropriateness of empiric gentamicin and vancomycin therapy for bacteremias in chronic dialysis outpatient units in the era of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Bacteremias in inpatient chronic HD units have been described, but there is little information on bacteremias in ambulatory HD units. To determine the frequency of bacteremia and pathogen distribution in ambulatory chronic HD units, we retrospectively reviewed our experience with 107 bacteremias in 5 chronic ambulatory HD units over a 3 year period. The object of the study was twofold. The first objective was to determine if bacteremias in ambulatory HD setting were substantially different in frequency or type than in the inpatient HD setting. Secondly, febrile patients suspected of having bacteremia in chronic HD patients are often empirically treated with vancomycin and gentamicin. Chronic HD patients require repeated and frequent venous access for HD. Bacteremias are common in chronic HD patients and may be primary or secondary and are often related to venous access site infections. The distributions of bacteremia pathogens in chronic HD patients are predominantly reflective of skin flora, i.e., staphylococci and to lesser extent aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. After S. aureus (MSRA/MSSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS), enterococci are the next most important Gram-positive pathogens in bacteremic HD patients. Most strains of E. faecalis are sensitive to vancomycin and for practical purposes should be considered as vancomycin sensitive enterococci (VSE). In contrast, most strains of E. faecium are resistant to vancomycin and should be considered as vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). We retrospectively reviewed 107 patients on chronic ambulatory HD to determine the adequacy of empiric vancomycin and gentamicin prophylaxis. We found amikacin is preferred to gentamicin and that meropenem is an effective alternate substitution for gentamicin and vancomycin combination therapy.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance among pneumococci, enterococci, and staphylococci has become increasingly important in recent decades. Clinicians should be familiar with the nuances of antibiotic susceptibility testing and interpretation in selecting antibiotics for these infections. The clinical significance of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae, and multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae is discussed. The clinical spectrum and therapeutic approach to Enterococcus faecalis (i.e., vancomycin-sensitive enterococci) and E faecium (i.e., vancomycin-resistant enterococci) are discussed. Differences in therapeutic approach between methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infections are reviewed. Differences between in vitro susceptibility testing and in vivo effectiveness of antibiotics for hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) are described. Finally, the clinical features of infection and therapy of HA-MRSA and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections are compared.
TI  - High-level vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with a  polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  - Glycopeptides such as vancomycin are the treatment of choice for infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This study describes the identification of high-level vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) isolates in a polymicrobial biofilm within an indwelling nephrostomy tube in a patient in New York. S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Micrococcus species, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the biofilm. For VRSA isolates, vancomycin MICs ranged from 32 to >128 microg/ml. VRSA isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillin, and tetracycline but remained susceptible to chloramphenicol, linezolid, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The vanA gene was localized to a plasmid of approximately 100 kb in VRSA and E. faecium isolates from the biofilm. Plasmid analysis revealed that the VRSA isolate acquired the 100-kb E. faecium plasmid, which was then maintained without integration into the MRSA plasmid. The tetracycline resistance genes tet(U) and tet(S), not previously detected in S. aureus isolates, were identified in the VRSA isolates. Additional resistance elements in the VRSA isolate included a multiresistance gene cluster, ermB-aadE-sat4-aphA-3, msrA (macrolide efflux), and the bifunctional aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2")-Ia. Multiple combinations of resistance genes among the various isolates of staphylococci and enterococci, including vanA, tet(S), and tet(U), illustrate the dynamic nature of gene acquisition and loss within and between bacterial species throughout the course of infection. The potential for interspecies transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes, including resistance to vancomycin, may be enhanced by the microenvironment of a biofilm.
TI  - High prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: a KONSAR program in 2004.
AB  - A nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in Korea. In this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by KONSAR group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. In hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals, but Escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. The proportions of Enterococcus faecium to all isolates of Enterococcus faecalis plus E. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. The mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals were: oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) Streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). In conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. Increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activities of high-dose daptomycin with and without coadministration of gentamicin against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus species.
AB  - The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal titers (SBTs) of daptomycin alone and in combination with gentamicin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci to determine if there might be any benefit to the addition of the aminoglycoside. A multiple-dose, randomized crossover study was performed in 11 healthy volunteers to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of 6 mg/kg of body weight daptomycin once daily with or without 1 mg/kg gentamicin every 8 h. SBTs were determined against clinical isolates of nosocomial (MRSA 494) and community-acquired (CA-MRSA 44) methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (VSEF 49452), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF 80), and quality control strains of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (ATCC 29213) and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecalis (ATCC 29212). Enhancement of bactericidal activity was evaluated by calculating and comparing the areas under the bactericidal curve (AUBC) for each dosing regimen against each isolate. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h and clearance for daptomycin alone were 645 +/- 91 microg.h/ml and 9.47 +/- 1.4 mg/h/kg, respectively, compared with 642 +/- 69 microg.h/ml and 9.45 +/- 1.0 mg/h/kg for daptomycin plus gentamicin. Daptomycin alone displayed sustained bactericidal activity against five of the six isolates over the entire 24-h dosing interval; bactericidal activity was maintained for 8 h against VREF 80. Mean AUBCs for daptomycin alone ranged from 935 to 1,263 and 36 to 238 against staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates, respectively, compared with 902 to 972 and 34 to 213 against staphylococci and enterococci when coadministered with gentamicin. The results of this study suggest that the addition of gentamicin does not alter the pharmacokinetic profile or enhance the bactericidal activity of daptomycin against staphylococcal or enterococcal isolates.
TI  - Evaluation of inhibition and cross-reaction effects on real-time PCR applied to the total DNA of wastewater samples for the quantification of bacterial antibiotic resistance genes and taxon-specific targets.
AB  - In order to evaluate the applicability of six primer and probe sets for TaqMan real-time RCR on DNA of wastewater samples, effects of the sample matrix and DNA background on target quantification were studied with respect to differences between functional genes and taxonomically used rDNA targets. Primer/probe assays for real-time PCR (TaqMan) designed to quantitatively detect the antibiotic resistance genes bla(VIM), vanA, ampC, mecA, and taxon-specific 23S rDNA sequences for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium/faecalis were tested for their sensitivity and amplification robustness. The amplification of their gene targets in DNA extracts of wastewater ("wastewater DNA") and reference strains ("reference DNA") was compared with their amplification in "model DNA" which was composed of wastewater DNA and reference DNA. Target detection was quantifiable along up to seven decimal orders of magnitude. For the detection of the resistance genes bla(VIM), vanA, ampC, and mecA as well as the enterococci directed PCR only weak or no inhibition due to the impurities or wastewater DNA matrix were demonstrated for the applied target concentrations. The taxonomically applied detection system for the quantification of P. aeruginosa showed a limited performance. For the analysis of the amplification dynamics of possibly similar nucleotide sequences of organisms related to P. aeruginosa a SYBR Green assay was employed. Competitive amplification of similar sequences was identified to be a major mechanism of reduced sensitivity. Hence, the primers were modified for an optimised detection. With the resulting reduction of cross reactions an increased sensitivity was achieved for the detection and quantification of P. aeruginosa in wastewater DNA.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates with reduced susceptibilities to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - An initiative was taken to determine the in vitro activity of daptomycin against  85 Gram-positive isolates with reduced susceptibilities to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Daptomycin had potent activity against all strains, with a Staphylococcus spp. minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) < or =2 microg/mL and an Enterococcus spp. MIC < or =8 microg/mL. Resistance to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin.
TI  - Antimicrobial disinfection effect of a laundering procedure for hospital textiles against various indicator bacteria and fungi using different substrates for simulating human excrements.
AB  - Recent studies confirm the increase of nosocomial infections and microbial resistance. One of the possible causes is infected textiles due to inappropriate laundering procedures. Most Slovenian laundries use thermal laundering procedures with high energy and water consumption to disinfect hospital textiles. In addition to this fact, there is an increasing number of hospital textiles composed of cotton/polyester blends that cannot endure high temperatures of thermal disinfection. On the other hand, decreasing the temperature of laundering procedures enhances the possibility of pathogenic microorganisms to survive the laundering procedure. In our research, we determined the antimicrobic laundering effect by simulating a common laundering procedure for hospital textiles in the laboratory washing machine at different temperatures by the use of bioindicators. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium terrae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used for determining the antibacterial laundering effect. Candida albicans was used for determining the antifungal laundering effect. Swine blood, artificial sweat, and swine fat were used as substrates for simulating human excrements and were inoculated together with the chosen microorganisms onto cotton pieces to simulate real laundering conditions. It was found that E. faecium, S. aureus, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa survived at 60 degrees C, but no microorganisms were found at 75 degrees C.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - New bisanthraquinone antibiotics and semi-synthetic derivatives with potent activity against clinical Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium isolates.
AB  - The escalation of antibiotic resistance among Gram-positive pathogens presents increasing treatment challenges and requires the development of innovative therapeutic agents. Here, we present the antimicrobial properties of structurally unusual bisanthraquinone metabolites produced by a marine streptomycete and four semi-synthetic derivatives. Biological activities were measured against clinically derived isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), and methicillin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant, and tetracycline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA, and TRSA, respectively). The most potent antibiotic displayed MIC(50) values of 0.11, 0.23, and 0.90microM against a panel (n=25 each) of clinical MSSA, MRSA, and VRE, respectively, and was determined to be bactericidal by time-kill analysis.
TI  - Five-year surveillance of nosocomial infections in Ankara Training and Research Hospital.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the rate of nosocomial infections (NIs), frequency of nosocomial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility changes in a 530-bed hospital over a five-year period. Hospital-wide laboratory-based NI surveillance was performed prospectively between 1999 and 2003. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definitions were used for NIs and nosocomial surgical site infections, and NI rates were calculated by the number of NIs per number of hospitalized patients on an annual basis. NI rates ranged between 1.4% and 2.4%. Higher rates were observed in the neurology, neurosurgery, paediatric and dermatology departments; the low rate of NIs overall may be due to the surveillance method used. The most commonly observed infections were urinary tract, surgical site and primary bloodstream infections, and the most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Carbapenems were the most effective agents against enterobacteriaceae. Meticillin resistance among S. aureus isolates was less than 50%, and all S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. isolates were susceptible to glycopeptides apart from one glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium isolate identified in 2003. Data obtained by the same method enabled comparison between years and assisted in the detection of recent changes. Antimicrobial susceptibility data on nosocomial pathogens provided valuable guidance for empirical antimicrobial therapy of NIs.
TI  - Intracellular accumulation of linezolid in Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes: role of enhanced efflux pump activity and inactivation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The oxazolidinone class of antibiotics such as linezolid have a narrow spectrum of activity that targets Gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesized that the poor activity of linezolid in Gram-negative bacteria is in part caused by relatively low intracellular concentration due to efflux. METHODS: Using whole cell accumulation assays we estimated the intracellular concentration of linezolid in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae. We included test strains with enhanced RND-type multidrug efflux pump activity and with genetic inactivation of the pump or functional inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone as inhibitor of the proton motive force or 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (NMP), an efflux pump inhibitor. RESULTS: Consistent with susceptibility studies, enhanced pump activity caused decreased accumulation, and pump inactivation and inhibition caused increased accumulation, of linezolid. The accumulation levels in test strains of E. coli, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes with functional pumps were lower than in control strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, but were higher after pump inactivation and correlated with ethidium bromide and pyronin Y accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: The intracellular concentration of linezolid is comparatively low owing to efficient efflux of the drug and could be increased substantially by inhibition of RND-type efflux pumps.
TI  - Purification and characterization of two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from Mongolian airag.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to isolate and identify bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) issued from Mongolian airag (traditional fermented mare's milk), and to purify and characterize bacteriocins produced by these LAB. METHODS AND RESULTS: Identification of the bacteria (Enterococcus durans) was carried out on the basis of its morphological, biochemical characteristics and carbohydrate fermentation profile and by API50CH kit and 16S rDNA analyses. The pH-neutral cell-free supernatant of this bacterium inhibited the growth of several Lactobacillus spp. and food-borne pathogens including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria innocua. The antimicrobial agent (enterocin A5-11) was heat stable and was not sensitive to acid and alkaline conditions (pH 2-10), but was sensitive to several proteolytic enzymes. Its inhibitory activity was completely eliminated after treatment with proteinase K and alpha-chymotrypsin. The activity was however not completely inactivated by other proteases including trypsin and pepsin. Three-step purification procedure with high recovery yields was developed to separate two bacteriocins. The applied procedure allowed the recovery of 16% and 64% of enterocins A5-11A and A5-11B, respectively, present in the culture supernatant with purity higher than 99%. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed that enterocin A5-11 has a molecular mass of 5000 Da and mass spectrometry analyses demonstrates molecular masses of 5206 and 5218 Da for fractions A and B, respectively. Amino acid analyses of both enterocins indicated significant quantitative difference in their contents in threonine, alanine, isoleucine and leucine. Their N-termini were blocked hampering straightforward Edman degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriocins A5-11A and B from Ent. durans belong to the class II of bacteriocins. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Judging from molecular masses, amino acid composition and spectrum of activities, bacteriocins A5-11A and B from Ent. durans show high degree of similarity with enterocins L50A and L50B isolated from Enterococcus faecium (Cintas et al. 1998, 2000) and with enterocin I produced by Ent. faecium 6T1a, a strain originally isolated from a Spanish-style green olive fermentation (Floriano et al. 1998).
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in the southeastern Mediterranean--preliminary results from the ARMed project.
AB  - Sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the Mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been lacking in the past. Susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey were collected as part of the ARMed project. Preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in S. pneumoniae to range from 0% (Malta) to 36% (Algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in Lebanon to 65% in Jordan [median: 43%]. Significant country specific resistance in E. coli was also seen, with 72% of isolates from Egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in Turkey. Vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of E. faecalis isolates from Turkey and in 3.8% of E. faecium isolates from Cyprus. The preliminary results from the ARMed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the Mediterranean region. They suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern Mediterranean region where resistance in S. aureus and E. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the other countries of the Mediterranean.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated from European medical centres: results of the Daptomycin Surveillance Programme (2002-2004).
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 9322 contemporary (2002-2004) gram-positive bacterial isolates collected from 31 medical centres in 14 countries in Europe were evaluated by broth microdilution methods according to CLSI guidelines. The isolates collected comprised Staphylococcus aureus (4842 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 1942 isolates), Enterococcus faecalis (1147 isolates), Enterococcus faecium (391 isolates), beta-haemolytic streptococci (660 isolates) and viridans group streptococci (340 isolates). The organisms were tested against daptomycin and more than 20 comparator agents in Mueller-Hinton broth, supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/L when testing daptomycin. Overall, methicillin (oxacillin) resistance rates were 26.7% and 77.0% for S. aureus (MRSA) and CoNS, respectively, and the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 6.1%. MRSA rates varied from 0.6% in Sweden to 40.2-43.0% in Belgium, Greece, Ireland, the UK and Israel, and VRE rates varied from 0% in Switzerland to 21.2% in Ireland. More than 99.9% of isolates tested were considered susceptible to daptomycin according to breakpoints established by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the CLSI. Daptomycin was active against all gram-positive species, with the highest MIC being 2, 8, 0.5 and 2 mg/L for staphylococci, enterococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci, respectively. Daptomycin activity was not influenced adversely by resistance to other agents among staphylococci or enterococci. This novel lipopeptide (daptomycin) appears to be an excellent alternative therapeutic option for serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms isolated in Europe.
TI  - Design and synthesis of quinolinones as methionyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors.
AB  - Five new structural analogues of substituted-1H-quinolinones (19, 20, 23, 24, and 26) have been synthesized and evaluated for Staphylococcus aureus methionyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme inhibitory activity. These compounds were also tested against pathogens of six S. aureus, two Enterococcus faecalis, and one Enterococcus faecium. Among all the synthesized quinolinones, compound 20 displayed significant inhibitory activities in the strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are common causes of bloodstream and other infections in hospitalized patients in the United States, and the percentage of nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria is increasing. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are of particular concern. In the United States, approximately 60% of staphylococcal infections in the intensive care unit are now caused by MRSA, and percentages continue to rise. Outbreaks of hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) are typically the result of clonal spread by MRSA being transferred from patient to patient, frequently using healthcare personnel as intermediaries. HA-MRSA strains are generally multidrug resistant. Vancomycin is the standard treatment for serious MRSA infections, but a few cases of vancomycin-resistant S aureus (VRSA) have recently emerged in the United States. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is also increasing. Soft tissue infections are the most frequent presentations of CA-MRSA, but life-threatening invasive infections occur as well, including necrotizing pneumonia. The mechanisms of methicillin resistance are the same for CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA, but susceptibilities to non-a-lactam antibiotics often differ. CA-MRSA exhibits broader antibiotic susceptibility than does HA-MRSA. The proportion of enterococci resistant to vancomycin continues to rise in the hospital setting, with the overwhelming majority of infections due to Enterococcus faecium. Clonal spread of VRE has been documented, but polyclonal outbreaks associated with antimicrobial use are also common. The relations between antibiotic use and VRE colonization are complex and related to the antienterococcal activity, biliary excretion, and antianaerobic activity of the antibiotic. Recent results show a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) since the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and suggest that, where available, vaccines may be useful in the battle to slow the spread of resistant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin MICs.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. This study assessed two Food and Drug Administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin MICs, Etest and JustOne. A collection of 220 selected isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. avium, E. durans, E. casseliflavus, and E. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. Included in the collection were 22 S. aureus and 14 Enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin MICs. As the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. Daptomycin MICs agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by Etest and for 100% by JustOne. However, daptomycin MICs determined by Etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference MICs for 65% of the Enterococcus sp. isolates tested. This resulted in 28.5% very major (VM) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all E. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. Use of JustOne yielded MICs that were 1 dilution lower than the reference MICs for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. This resulted in 13.6% VM errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% VM errors (2/14) with enterococci. The manufacturer-recommended JustOne inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) CFU/ml in the wells of the strip. Increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) CFU/ml eliminated two of five VM errors upon retesting. No major interpretive errors occurred with either device. In summary, daptomycin MICs generated by the Etest or JustOne method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin MICs. However, both devices produced slightly lower MICs that resulted in some VM errors.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are common causes of bloodstream and other infections in hospitalized patients in the United States, and the percentage of nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria is increasing. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are of particular concern.

CA-MRSA exhibits broader antibiotic susceptibility than does HA-MRSA. The proportion of enterococci resistant to vancomycin continues to rise in the hospital setting, with the overwhelming majority of infections due to Enterococcus faecium. Clonal spread of VRE has been documented, but polyclonal outbreaks associated with antimicrobial use are also common. The relations between antibiotic use and VRE colonization are complex and related to the antienterococcal activity, biliary excretion, and antianaerobic activity of the antibiotic. Recent results show a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) since the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and suggest that, where available, vaccines may be useful in the battle to slow the spread of resistant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - Inactivation of influenza A virus by gentian violet (GV) and GV-dyed cotton cloth, and bactericidal activities of these agents.
AB  - Recently we have heard warnings of an outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1). Although, to prevent such infections we must prepare anti-viral drugs and type-specific vaccines against influenza, we need various simple and effective protection methods, such as the use of face masks for public health. Also, in any consideration of bacterial infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) also pose serious concerns which must be addressed. I examined the antiviral activity of gentian violet (GV) and GV-dyed cloth against the influenza A (H1N1) virus. Time-kill studies were carried out, and the virus titer was determined based on the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of GV against bacteria were also determined, and the killing activities of the GV-dyed cloth were judged from viable cell counts. GV immediately killed the influenza A virus and this was confirmed by electron microscopy. Moreover, cloth dyed with a combination of GV and copper showed not only excellent antiviral activity but also prominent bactericidal activities.
TI  - 7-O-malonyl macrolactin A, a new macrolactin antibiotic from Bacillus subtilis active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and a small-colony variant of Burkholderia cepacia.
AB  - We report here the discovery, isolation, and chemical and preliminary biological  characterization of a new antibiotic compound, 7-O-malonyl macrolactin A (MMA), produced by a Bacillus subtilis soil isolate. MMA is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that inhibits a number of multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and a small-colony variant of Burkholderia cepacia. MMA-treated staphylococci and enterococci were pseudomulticellular and exhibited multiple asymmetric initiation points of septum formation, indicating that MMA may inhibit a cell division function.
TI  - The effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the survival of different bacteria inoculated in Optisol-GS at refrigerated storage temperature (6 degrees C) and after subsequent warming to room temperature (19-22 degrees C). METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were chosen from stock clinical isolates for inclusion in the study. The first group consisted of 12 Optisol-GS vials. The second group consisted of 12 Optisol-GS vials containing corneas inappropriate for transplantation according to the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) protocols. Each group was inoculated with 3 concentrations of approximately 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of each bacterial species and then refrigerated per EBAA protocol. After 48 hours of refrigeration, all vials were placed at room temperature (RT) and counts were performed at 48, 50 (2 hour RT), 54 (6 hour RT), 60 (12 hour RT), 72 (24 hour RT), and 96 (48 hour RT) hours. At 96 hours, the corneal tissue from 10 and 10 inocula were cultured. All samples underwent serial dilution, spiral plating on blood agar plates, and incubation at 35 degrees C. Viable colony counts were determined at 24 hours. RESULTS: Except for the 10 CFU/mL inocula of P. aeruginosa, all isolates were viable after 48 hours of refrigeration. Rapid bactericidal activity was observed against P. aeruginosa after 2 hours at RT, with complete sterilization by 6 hours. The rate and extent of killing against S. aureus were influenced by the initial inoculum. Bactericidal activity was achieved after 2 hours at RT with 10 CFU/mL of S. aureus versus 24 hours with the 10 inoculum. Of note, bactericidal activity was not observed against S. pneumoniae and E. faecium following 24 hours of storage at RT. The presence of corneal tissue did not affect viable counts, with counts from corneal tissue cultures reflecting the counts seen from Optisol-GS after 48 hours at RT. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS was reduced at refrigerated temperature and enhanced at RT. Bactericidal activity was not observed against E. faecium at either refrigerated temperature or RT.
TI  - The anti-microbial activity of electrolysed oxidizing water against microorganisms relevant in veterinary medicine.
AB  - Standards of the German Association of Veterinary Medicine (DVG) for the evaluation of chemical disinfectants were used to assess the anti-microbial efficacy of electrolysed oxidizing water (EOW). Enterococcus faecium, Mycobacterium avium subspecies avium, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans were exposed to anode EOW (pH, 3.0+/-0.1; oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), +1100+/-50 mV; free chlorine, 400+/-20 mg/l Cl2) and combined EOW (7:3 anode:cathode, v/v; pH, 8.3+/-0.1; ORP, 930-950 mV; free chlorine, 271+/-20 mg/l Cl2). In water of standardized hardness (WSH), all bacterial strains were completely inactivated by a 30 min exposure to maximum 10.0% anode EOW (approximately 40.0 mg/l Cl2) or 50.0% combined EOW (approximately 135.5 mg/l Cl2). The sensitivity ranking order for anode EOW to the bacterial test strains was P. mirabilis>S. aureus>M. avium ssp. avium>E. faecium>P. aeruginosa. P. mirabilis and S. aureus decreased to undetectable levels after 5 min of exposure to 7.5% anode EOW (approximately 30.0 mg/l Cl2). Candida albicans was completely inactivated by a 5-min exposure to 5.0% anode EOW. Both, anode and combined EOW exhibited no anti-microbial activities in standardized nutrient broth or after addition of 20.0% bovine serum to the WSH. Further research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of EOW as a disinfectant under operating conditions in animal production facilities.
TI  - Predominance of Gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern Taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of empirical therapy. This study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. METHODS: During the period from 1996 to 2003 at National Cheng Kung University Hospital, patients with NBSIs were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2003, there were 4,038 episodes of NBSIs. The overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of NBSIs, respectively. The 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of NBSIs), Staphylococcus aureus (13%), Candida spp. (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and Escherichia coli (8%). Oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of S. aureus isolates. In contrast to Enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. The emerging antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, Candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing NBSIs and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. Surveillance of the characteristics of NBSIs and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin alone and in combination with various antimicrobials against Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The increasing prevalence of resistant Gram-positive cocci requires the need to search for more effective agents and synergistic combinations. Forty-two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), 30 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 36 Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strains were studied. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined and synergy testing was performed by using E test for daptomycin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate against staphylococci; for daptomycin, ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin against enterococci. Daptomycin in combination with ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin was tested against enterococci; daptomycin in combination with ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ticarcillin-clavulanate was tested against staphylococci. Interaction categories were defined by the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index. All strains of staphylococci and enterococci were susceptible to daptomycin. All three combinations showed synergy against more than 70% of the MRSA strains. Daptomycin in combination with ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin against enterococci showed synergies of 64.2%, 57.1% and 21.4%, respectively. This study indicates that daptomycin alone and combined with beta-lactams seems to be effective against MRSA, but further in vitro and in vivo studies on the subject are required before clinical use can be recommended.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, LBM415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of LBM415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (PDFI) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (uSSTI), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. METHODS: A total of 21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. Characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS); resistance to penicillin (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) among 18.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of Enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of Haemophilus influenzae. RESULTS: LBM415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus faecium and Moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/L; 97.0% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of H. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. Seventy-seven percent of Burkholderia cepacia and 82.0% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/L. No differences in LBM415 activity against S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp. and H. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. While regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to LBM415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. One isolate of S. aureus displayed high-level resistance to LBM415 owing to multiple sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defB and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. This isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: With few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first PDFI class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. These compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. Given the detection of a pre-existing PDFI-resistant isolate of S. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the PDFI-targeted pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will be an important component of future studies.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in Enterococcus isolates from Batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. Isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. However, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
TI  - Further increase of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: 2003 KONSAR surveillance.
AB  - Monitoring temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance can provide useful information for the empirical selection of antimicrobial agents to treat infected patients and for the control of nosocomial infections. In this study, we analyzed antimicrobial resistance of clinically relevant bacteria in 2003 at Korean hospitals and at a commercial laboratory. The following organism-antimicrobial agent resistance combinations were very prevalent: oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (68%), expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), and fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli (33%), Acinetobacter spp. (58%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (40%). Moreover, gradual increases in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (20%), cefoxitin-resistant E. coli (10%) and K. pneumoniae (23%), and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (20%) and Acinetobacter spp. (13%) were also observed. The resistance rates of Acinetobacter spp. to most antimicrobial agents at hospitals and at the commercial laboratory were similar. Among the Acinetobacter spp. isolated at a tertiary-care hospital, 46.2% were multidrug-resistant to 9-12 of 13 antimicrobial agents, and 18.3% were panresistant. The exclusion of duplicate isolates at a tertiary-care hospital significantly lowered the proportion of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli.
TI  - Percutaneous drainage of infected pancreatic fluid collections in critically ill  patients: correlation with C-reactive protein values.
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of percutaneous catheter drainage, of early infected pancreatic fluid collections, in critically ill patients with severe acute pancreatitis. The patients in our series had a mean Ranson's score of 5.4. Nineteen (63.3%) of the 30 patients were cured with percutaneous drainage. In this group, the mean C-reactive protein value at the beginning of treatment was 172.8 U/l and 102.5 U/l at the end (P<.001). Cultures yielded multiple organisms in 23 patients (76.7%). The most frequently seen organisms were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - Beta-nitrostyrene derivatives as potential antibacterial agents: a structure-property-activity relationship study.
AB  - A multidisciplinary project was developed, combining the synthesis of a series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives and the determination of their physicochemical parameters (redox potentials, partition coefficients), to the evaluation of the corresponding antibacterial activity. A complete conformational analysis was also performed, in order to get relevant structural information. Subsequently, a structure-property-activity (SPAR) approach was applied, through linear regression analysis, aiming at obtaining a putative correlation between the physicochemical parameters of the compounds investigated and their antibacterial activity (both against standard strains and clinical isolates). The beta-nitrostyrene compounds displayed a lower activity towards all the tested bacteria relative to the beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene analogues. This was observed particularly for the 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene (IVb) against the Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium). The SPAR results revealed the existence of a clear correlation between the redox potentials and the antibacterial activity of the series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives under study.

TI  - Pacemaker-related endocarditis: clinical features and treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Removal of the entire infected system is the traditionally indicated management of pacemaker lead endocarditis (PLE), based on expert recommendations. Herein is described the present authors' experience with this condition. METHODS: Between 1987 and 2004, all consecutive patients with PLE treated at a tertiary referral university hospital and a community hospital were prospectively selected. Clinical features, management and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of PLE were diagnosed. Surgery was performed in 10 cases, and medical treatment alone in three (due to advanced age in two cases and because of terminal colon cancer in one case). Four subjects died before discharge: three deaths occurred after surgery (one patient died due to refractory ventricular arrhythmia and two from persistent sepsis), and one unoperated patient died from sepsis and severe renal failure. No deaths or late surgeries were observed after a mean follow up period of 37 +/- 14 months. Both patients who survived hospitalization and underwent only medical treatment were free from late complications after 30 and 60 months follow up, respectively. CONCLUSION: Some patients with PLE present a good evolution without surgery, suggesting that surgical treatment is not mandatory in this situation. However, an indication for surgery may be similar to that for other cases of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Marinomycins A-D, antitumor-antibiotics of a new structure class from a marine actinomycete of the recently discovered genus "marinispora".
AB  - Four antitumor-antibiotics of a new structure class, the marinomycins A-D (1-4),  were isolated from the saline culture of a new group of marine actinomycetes, for which we have proposed the name "Marinispora". The structures of the marinomycins, which are unusual macrodiolides composed of dimeric 2-hydroxy-6-alkenyl-benzoic acid lactones with conjugated tetraene-pentahydroxy polyketide chains, were assigned by combined spectral and chemical methods. In room light, marinomycin A slowly isomerizes to its geometrical isomers marinomycins B and C. Marinomycins A-D show significant antimicrobial activities against drug resistant bacterial pathogens and demonstrate impressive and selective cancer cell cytotoxicities against six of the eight melanoma cell lines in the National Cancer Institute's 60 cell line panel. The discovery of these new compounds from a new, chemically rich genus further documents that marine actinomycetes are a significant resource for drug discovery.
TI  - Tigecycline: a novel glycylcycline antibiotic.
AB  - Tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, was developed to recapture the broad spectrum of activity of the tetracycline class and to treat patients with difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. Tigecycline's in vitro spectrum of activity encompasses aerobic, facultative and anaerobic Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Clinical trials involving patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections, including patients infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, demonstrated that tigecycline was bacteriologically and clinically effective with mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal adverse events (i.e., nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) the most commonly reported. Tigecycline is a promising new broad-spectrum parenteral monotherapy for the treatment of patients with Gram-positive and -negative bacterial infections.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 3 against multidrug-resistant nosocomial strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii was evaluated. A fast bactericidal effect (within 20 min) against all bacterial strains tested was observed. The presence of 20% human serum abolished the bactericidal activity of hBD-3 against gram-negative strains and reduced the activity of the peptide against gram-positive strains.
TI  - Partial characterization of enterocin MR99 from a corn silage isolate of Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - AIMS: To assess the inhibitory activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of several species of enterococci recovered from a natural corn silage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The inhibitory activity of strains of Enterococcus faecalis (58), Enterococcus faecium (35), Enterococcus gallinarum (3) and Enterococcus casseliflavus (4) were studied employing indicator strains from various sources (clinical, food and ATCC). Enterococcus faecalis MR99, the only strain with inhibitory activity, inhibited other enterococci, Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium spp., Bacillus spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri. The bacterium contained only one conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. The partially chromatography-purified MR99 enterocin (PPE) had a molecular weight of approx. 5000 Da and a pI of 6.2, was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and could be extracted in benzene and butanol. It appeared stable to adjustment of pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0 and was resistant to heat. Inactivation was at 15 min at 121 degrees C. Enterocin MR99 was bactericidal on strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Staph. aureus, and bovine mastitis agents, it was bacteriostatic on E. coli. Although enterocins MR99 and AS48 have inhibitory activity on Gram-negative bacilli, PCR studies demonstrated a lack of relationship between them. CONCLUSIONS: The active component had a protein nature, was resistant to heat and presented a wide inhibitory spectrum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The biological properties of Ent. faecalis MR99 suggest that this strain merits further investigations so it can be applied in human and veterinary health programmes.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. Its use results in a profound decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. However, no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex. Fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (14 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), Enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and Escherichia coli (7 episodes). DISCUSSION: We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound CD4 positive T lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of CD4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
TI  - Activity of a new oral streptogramin, XRP2868, against gram-positive cocci harboring various mechanisms of resistance to streptogramins.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of XRP2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of RPR132552 (streptogramin A) and RPR202868 (streptogramin B), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. The effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin A or B on the activity of XRP2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The species tested included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. XRP2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against S. aureus, E. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against E. faecalis (MICs = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). XRP2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. Nevertheless, the strong activity of factor A of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and E. faecium (MICs = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low MICs against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor A or factor B of the streptogramin. However, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors A and B caused an increase in the MICs of XRP2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. As with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of XRPR2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.
TI  - A re-emerging class of antimicrobial agents: streptogramins (quinupristin/dalfopristin) in the management of multiresistant gram-positive nosocomial cocci in hospital setting.
AB  - Multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, are emerging pathogens in the setting of immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, especially when surgery or invasive procedures are of concern, and patients are admitted in intensive care units. The spectrum of antimicrobial compounds available for an effective treatment of these infection is significantly threatened by the emerging and spread of glycopeptide-resistant strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a novel streptogramine association, which represents an effective response to most of these problems, due to its innovative mechanim of action, its maintained activity against multiresistant pathogens, and its possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds. Problems related to the epidemiology of multiresistant gram-positive infection, potential clinical indications of quinupristin/dalfopristin, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of this compound and its derivatives, are outlined on the ground of a review of available literature evidences.

TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated organisms in Taiwan.
AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other comparators against 861 bacterial isolates recovered from patients treated in three major teaching hospitals in 2003. MICs to antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. High rates of oxacillin resistance (58%) in Staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), and vancomycin resistance (21%) and quinupristin-dalfopristin non-susceptibility (39%) in Enterococcus faecium (34 isolates) were found. Carbapenems had excellent in vitro activities (>or=98% susceptibility) against the 419 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, with the MIC(50) and MIC(90) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem being 0.25 and 4 mg/L, 0.03 and 0.12 mg/L, and 0.03 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. For, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (74 isolates) and Burkholderia cepacia (21 isolates), meropenem (MIC(90), 0.25, 2, and 4 mg/L, respectively) had better in vitro activities than imipenem (MIC(90), 8, 4, and 32 mg/L, respectively) and ertapenem (MIC(90), 0.5, >32, and 32 mg/L, respectively). Isepamicin had a similar activity with amikacin against all Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B. cepacia, and Acinetobacter baumannii, except for C. freundii isolates in which isepamicin had an eight-fold activity better than amikacin. Tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against all isolates tested (MIC(90), <or=1 mg/L) including 14 pandrugresistant A. baumannii isolates (MICs, 1-4 mg/L), except for Proteus mirabilis (59 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), Bacteroides fragilis (60 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC(90), 16 mg/L), and B. cepacia (21 isolates; MIC(90), 16 mg/L). Tigecycline, carbapenems, and isepamicin exhibited better or comparable in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of commonly encountered bacteria than other comparator antimicrobials and may represent therapeutic options for infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens and effect on treatment.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens is a growing concern for health care and for public health. A recent shift in the epidemiological profile of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has resulted not only in health care-associated infections but now, also, in community-associated infections. Reports have described S. aureus exhibiting decreased susceptibility and, even, resistance to vancomycin. The rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci may be leveling; however, vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium has already achieved high levels. Multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is increasing, and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella strains are emerging. Acinetobacter species cause a minority of health care-associated pneumonias due to gram-negative organisms, but a growing proportion is resistant to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. Recent increases in the frequency and severity of Clostridium difficile-associated illness are associated with the emergence of a hypervirulent C. difficile strain with increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones. The presence of these and other resistant organisms in health care facilities limits the number of effective antimicrobials available for treatment.
TI  - Daptomycin in vitro activity tested against Gram-positive strains collected from  European and Latin American medical centers in 2003.
AB  - Daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide, was susceptibility tested against clinical bacterial isolates consecutively collected in hospitals located in Europe (4,731 strains) and Latin America (1,007 strains) in 2003 as part of a continuing surveillance program. The bacterial isolates tested were Gram-positive pathogens that included staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci. The isolates were tested for susceptibility using broth microdilution methods (broth with 50 mg/L Ca++ for testing daptomycin). All isolates, except two Enterococcus faecium strains from Europe, were inhibited at daptomycin MIC of < or = 4 mg/L. In addition, 99.4 and 97.3% of isolates were inhibited at daptomycin MIC of < or = 2 and < or = 1 mg/L, respectively. Except for one Staphylococcus aureus and one viridans group streptococci from Europe and one coagulase-negative staphylococci from Latin America, all staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were inhibited by 1 mg/L of daptomycin. Resistance to other compounds (vancomycin, oxacillin, and penicillin) did not influence daptomycin activity. The activity of daptomycin was very similar in both geographic regions evaluated and demonstrated the same MIC distribution as isolates evaluated in studies in the United States. The results of this study showed that daptomycin continues to be very active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci isolated in Europe and Latin America.
TI  - Vancomycin resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The first vancomycin-resistant clinical isolates of Enterococcus species were reported in Europe in 1988. Similar strains were later detected in hospitals on the East Coast of the United States. Since then, vancomycin-resistant enterococci have spread with unexpected rapidity and are now encountered in hospitals in most countries. This article reviews the mode of action and the mechanism of bacterial resistance to glycopeptides, as exemplified by the VanA type, which is mediated by transposon Tn1546 and is widely spread in enterococci. The diversity, regulation, evolution, and recent dissemination of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are then discussed.
TI  - Microbiological features of vancomycin in the 21st century: minimum inhibitory concentration creep, bactericidal/static activity, and applied breakpoints to predict clinical outcomes or detect resistant strains.
AB  - The results of vancomycin susceptibility tests document that the drug continues to have activity against a wide variety of gram-positive pathogens. The subsequent emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, the persistent failure of vancomycin therapy against strains tested as susceptible, and the more recent discoveries of vancomycin-intermediate or -resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains have compromised the use of vancomycin. Although analyses of surveillance studies fail to demonstrate "minimum inhibitory concentration creep" among populations of wild-type enterococci, streptococci, or staphylococci, enterococci with acquired resistance to vancomycin continue to evolve. The dominantly used automated commercial tests poorly recognize vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus, heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus isolates, which necessitates the use of expensive supplemental screening tests. Monitoring for appropriate serum levels of vancomycin and determinations of the bactericidal activity of vancomycin appear to best predict clinical outcome, thus creating additional diagnostic burdens for clinical laboratories. Improvements in current test methods with breakpoint criteria and expanded use of the vancomycin bactericidal assays to detect "tolerant" strains will be required to increase the value of vancomycin treatment or to refocus therapy toward the use of newer, alternative agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial agents for treatment of serious infections caused by resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci.
AB  - As clinicians increasingly contend with infections due to staphylococci or enterococci resistant to, or failing treatment with, traditional antimicrobial agents, understanding the potential roles of older as well as more recently introduced antimicrobial agents becomes important. Older agents, such as clindamycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, have been used to treat infections due to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Among the licensed agents, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline are active in vitro against most strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, but these agents differ in their approved clinical indications. New agents currently under investigation may further expand treatment options.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem (S-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  - The spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. Using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; MIC90s 0.06 mg/L), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. Against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC50 4). Doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; MIC(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). For Enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (MIC90s 0.03-0.5 mg/L). MIC90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. Doripenem was also active against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. (MIC90s 0.06-0.25 mg/L), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/L, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem was slightly more potent (MIC50 2 mg/L) than ertapenem and imipenem (MIC50 4 mg/L), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (MIC50 2 mg/L), against Burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). Both Haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and Moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (MIC90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the LEADER 2004 surveillance program.
AB  - Since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has been gained. However, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the United States has not been reported. The LEADER 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. Organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 Staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS), 428 Enterococcus faecalis, 196 Enterococcus faecium, and 422 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. All S. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (MIC90 = 2 microg/ml); MIC distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. For CNS, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered (Staphylococcus epidermidis; MIC = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the MIC(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with S. aureus. For E. faecalis and E. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. Both species had an MIC90 of 2 microg/ml, and MIC distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. Linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the S. pneumoniae isolates. These findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. Nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.
TI  - Correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  - Bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. Species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. This differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. The objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. A literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (ICUs): Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Acetinobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. To determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in ICUs, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. All clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory DNA fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. A diversity index for each species was calculated as the number of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. The correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. Although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. They showed median survival times between 1.5 days (P. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (Enterococcus faecium). During the prospective ICU study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (Enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (E. coli) were found. A correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, P=0.024). Environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in ICUs. Infection control measures should consider this finding.
TI  - Dutch guideline for preventing nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (HRMO).
AB  - Hospitals are faced with the increasingly rapid emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. US and European guidelines on the prevention of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals were, until recently, mainly directed at methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In 2004, the Dutch Working Party on Infection Prevention issued a guideline on the prevention of nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (HRMO), in order to fulfill the growing need for additional guidance on the control of other pathogens with acquired resistance and the potential to spread within hospitals (such as glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, extendedspectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, and other (multi)drug-resistant gram-negatives). In addition to providing criteria for defining HRMO, the Dutch guideline provides recommendations on isolation of patients, active surveillance, and contact tracing. The guideline will enable the comparison of HRMO rates between hospitals, and may be used to evaluate the efficacy of programs to control antibiotic use and/or nosocomial transmission of resistant pathogens. The eventual success of nationwide implementation of this guideline remains to be established in the coming years.
TI  - Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. Much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in Western countries. Reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of Helicobacter pylori and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and group B streptococci. All phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. Furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. Phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid direct assay for identification of bacteria and the mec A and van genes from positive-testing blood cultures.
AB  - We performed the first evaluation of a DNA strip assay (GenoType blood culture; Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) for the detection of the most relevant bacterial sepsis pathogens directly from positive BACTEC blood culture bottles (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). The test comprises two panels, one for the direct species identification of important gram-positive cocci and the other for gram-negative rods. Additionally, detection of the mec A and the van genes are implemented. The GenoType assay was validated regarding its analytical sensitivity with blood cultures spiked with reference strains. Approximately 10(4) CFU per ml were detected. Analytical specificity was calculated with a test panel of 212 reference strains. Of the strains tested, 99% were correctly identified. Additionally, 279 consecutive blood cultures signaled positive by BACTEC were processed directly, in comparison to conventional methods. The GenoType assays were performed according to Gram stain morphology. A total of 243 (87.1%) of the 279 organisms isolated were covered by specific probes. A total of 152 organisms were gram-positive cocci, of which 148 (97.4%) were correctly identified by the GenoType assay. Ninety-one organisms were gram-negative rods, of which 89 (97.8%) were correctly identified. Concerning mec A gene detection, GenoType assay correctly detected 12 of 13 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. One Enterococcus faecium isolate with a positive van A gene isolated was correctly differentiated by the assay. All results were available 4 h after the results of microscopic analysis. The evaluated GenoType blood culture assay showed fast and reliable results in detecting the most important sepsis pathogens and the mec A and van genes directly from positive blood culture bottles.
TI  - Detection of a novel aph(2") allele (aph[2"]-Ie) conferring high-level gentamicin resistance and a spectinomycin resistance gene ant(9)-Ia (aad 9) in clinical isolates of enterococci.
AB  - Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) are major factors that confer aminoglycoside resistance to enterococci. In an epidemiologic study on distribution of 12 AME genes in 534 recent clinical strains isolated from a Japanese hospital, two uncommon AME genes, ant(9)-Ia and a novel aph(2") allele, aph(2")-Ie, were detected. ant(9)-Ia had been reported only in Staphylococcus aureus and encodes spectinomycin adenylyltransferase ANT(9)-I, which confers resistance to spectinomycin. The ant(9)-Ia gene was detected in three strains, a single strain each of Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. avium. Nucleotide sequences of ant(9)-Ia from these three enterococcal species were identical to that reported for S. aureus and considered to be located on Tn 554. The new aph(2") allele, designated aph(2")-Ie, was identified in three E. faecium strains. The aph(2")-Ie allele was genetically close to aph(2")-Id reported in E. casseliflavus (93.7% amino acid sequence identity; 96.3% similarity), while distant from aph(2")-Ia, aph(2")-Ib, or aph(2")-Ic (26.3-29.5% amino acid sequence identity). Sequence divergence between APH(2")-Id and APH(2")-Ie was mostly located in amino-terminal half. In contrast, sequences corresponding to the three motifs required for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase were conserved except for a single amino acid. Three E. faecium strains having aph(2")-Ie showed high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, but not to kanamycin, dibekacin, and tobramycin, unlike enzyme specificity described for aph(2")-Id in E. casseliflavus. Such a difference in resistance phenotype was suggested to be related to amino acid sequence divergence between APH(2")-Id and APH(2")-Ie.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Linezolid: a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in serious Gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid (Zyvox), the first available oxazolidinone antibacterial agent, has good activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Randomised multicentre trials in patients with various types of serious Gram-positive infections showed that clinical cure rates with linezolid were similar to those with vancomycin or teicoplanin. In some subgroup analyses, which must be interpreted with a degree of caution, clinical advantages were noted for linezolid (e.g. versus vancomycin in confirmed MRSA nosocomial pneumonia and MRSA-complicated skin and soft tissue infections). Although generally well tolerated, gastrointestinal adverse effects are relatively common with linezolid and it has been associated with thrombocytopenia and myelosuppression. The oral bioavailability of linezolid is approximately 100%, thus allowing sequential intravenous-to-oral administration without changing the drug or dosage regimen. Healthcare resource use data from various countries indicate that this practical advantage translates into at least a trend towards reduced length of hospital stay compared with vancomycin, which may offset its several-fold higher acquisition cost. Modelled analyses from the US, despite some limitations, indicate that, compared with vancomycin, linezolid is associated with lower total hospitalisation costs for the treatment of patients with cellulitis and has a favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately US30,000 dollars per QALY gained (2001 value) for patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Broadly similar results have also been reported in modelled analyses from other countries. In conclusion, for patients with serious Gram-positive infections, including those caused by suspected or proven multidrug-resistant pathogens such as MRSA, linezolid is an effective and generally well tolerated therapeutic option. Linezolid is currently the only antibacterial agent with good activity against MRSA that can be administered orally (as well as intravenously). It may be particularly useful as an alternative to vancomycin in patients who have impaired renal function, poor or no intravenous access, require outpatient therapy, or who have been unable to tolerate glycopeptides. Healthcare resource use studies and pharmacoeconomic analyses generally support the use of linezolid in some subgroups of patients, although results should be interpreted with due consideration of the study limitations.
TI  - Mechanism of action of dipropofol and synergistic action with other antibacterial agents in vitro.
AB  - The mode of action of dipropofol and its antibacterial activity in combination with other antibiotics against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated. Dipropofol showed a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus 209P, and inhibited the incorporations of 3H-glutamate and 3H-leucine into S. aureus 209P and Bacillus subtilis PCI219 cells. These results indicated that the mechanism of action of dipropofol was mediated by the inhibition of protein synthesis or amino acid incorporation. A synergistic effect was performed by checkerboard titration with Muller-Hinton agar plates containing dipropofol (0.39 microg/ml, 1/4 x MIC) and various concentrations of nine other antibiotics in vitro. The synergism against vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium was confirmed in the combination of dipropofol with rifampicin. The MIC of rifampicin was decreased from 0.39 microg/ml to <0.005 microg/ml by the addition of dipropofol. This combinational effect in reversing vancomycin resistance of enterococci highlights novel drug targets and has importance in the design of new therapeutic regimens against resistant pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of seven novel tetramethylpiperidine-substituted phenazines against multiple-drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A dramatic increase in multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive pathogens has occurred in recent times, leading to increased rates or morbidity and mortality and also associated with high costs for the treatment of these infections. It is clear that there is an urgent need for the development of effective antimicrobial agents. The anti-bacterial activity of seven 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMP)-substituted phenazines, compared to clofazimine (B663), were tested against 70 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MDR Streptococcus pneumoniae and resistant Enterococcus sp. METHODS: Standard minimum inhibitory concentration agar dilution susceptibility tests were done on all isolates, including ATCC control strains. RESULTS: All the TMP-substituted phenazines were more active than clofazimine against all isolates tested. Compound B4125 was the most active by inhibiting all growth of the organisms tested, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. CONCLUSION: Clofazimine has been shown to have anti-staphylococcal activity. We demonstrate enhanced anti-bacterial activity of TMP-substituted phenazines against drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms compared to clofazimine.
TI  - Effect of temporin A modifications on its cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Temporin A (TA), a short alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide isolated from the skin of the frog Rana temporaria, is effective against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains. TA interacts directly with the cell membrane of the microorganism and it has been reported to be non-toxic to erythrocytes at concentrations that are antimicrobial. Less is known about the effects on the viability and growth of nucleated eukaryotic cells. In this study we have tested antibacterial and growth-inhibitory properties of TA, its dimeric analogue (TAd), and all-L (TAL L512) and all-D (TAD L512) enantiomeric derivatives of modified TA towards S. aureus and cultured human keratinocytes, respectively. All molecules were antibacterial at concentrations from 1.5 microM to 10 microM. In keratinocyte cultures, TAD L512, as well as TAd, showed cytotoxicity. The original TA and TAL L512 did not affect the viability of the cells at their bacteriolytic concentrations. The growth of keratinocytes in low- and high-calcium media was only slightly inhibited by temporins at concentrations which were antibacterial to S. aureus. This suggests that original TA and its modification, TAL L512, are promising molecules against multiresistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Isolation of three new naturally occurring compounds from the culture of Micromonospora sp. P1068.
AB  - Bioassay guided isolation of an antibacterial extract prepared from the fermentation broth of a Micromonospora sp. P1068 led to the isolation of eight compounds identified as (3R) 3,4',7-trihydroxy-isoflavanone (1), 3-hydroxydehydrodaidzein, daidzein (2), 3-methyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid (3), 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde (4), 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-N-methylpropionamide, N-methylphloretamide (5), phenyl acetic acid (6), 2-hydroxy phenyl acetic acid (7) and 4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-benzoic acid (8). Compounds 1 and 5 were found to be novel chemical entities while 3 was isolated from a natural source for the first time. All compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against a panel of clinically significant microorganisms. Compound 4 was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC, 32 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecium (MIC, 32 microg/ml) and Escherichia coli (MIC, 64 microg/ml).
TI  - Evaluation of negative results of BacT/Alert 3D automated blood culture system.
AB  - Although automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems are both rapid and sensitive, false-positive and false-negative results still occur. The objective of this study, then, was to evaluate negative results occurring with BacT/Alert 3D blood culture systems. A total of 1032 samples were cultured with the BacT/Alert 3D automated blood culture system, using both aerobic (FA) and anaerobic (FN) [corrected] media, and 128 of these samples yielded positive results. A total of 904 negative blood samples were then subcultured in 5% sheep blood agar, eosin methylene blue, chocolate agar, and sabouraud-dextrose agar. Organisms growing on these subcultures were subsequently identified using both Vitek32 (bioMerieux, Durham, NC) and conventional methods. Twenty four (2.6%) of the 904 subcultures grew on the subculture media. The majority (83.3%) of these were determined to be gram-positive microorganisms. Fourteen (58.3%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci, two (8.3%) were Bacillus spp., one (4.2%) was Staphylococcus aureus, and one (4.2%) was identified as Enterococcus faecium. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria spp. were isolated together in two (8.3%) vials. Gram-negative microorganisms comprised 12.5% of the subcultures, of which two (8.3%) were found to be Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one (4.2%) was Pseudomonas fluorescens. The other isolate (4.2%) was identified as Candida albicans. We conclude that the subculture of negative results is valuable in the BacT/Alert 3D system, especially in situations in which only one set of blood cultures is taken.
TI  - The streptogramin antibiotics: update on their mechanism of action.
AB  - Antibiotics of the streptogramin class are an association of two types of chemically different compounds, group A molecules and group B molecules, acting in synergy. The combination of these molecules generally inhibits bacterial growth at a lower concentration than does either the group A or group B molecule alone and is often bactericidal against strains of bacteria for which each type of molecule alone is only bacteriostatic. The semisynthetic streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500), the first water-soluble member of this class, is under development for the treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and other organisms. The streptogramins block the translation of mRNA into protein. Both group A and group B molecules bind to the peptidyl-transferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. The group B molecule stimulates the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome and may interfere with the passage of the completed polypeptide away from the peptidyl-transferase centre. The group A molecule inhibits the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing both the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site and the formation of the peptide bond. When the two types of molecule are used in combination, the binding of the group A molecule alters the conformation of the ribosome such that the affinity of the ribosome for the B molecule is increased. This accounts, in part or entirely, for the observed synergy. This synergy is unaffected by ribosomal modifications conferring resistance to the macrolides, lincosamides, and group B molecules alone.
TI  - Pre- and post-engraftment bloodstream infection rates and associated mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  - We report on bloodstream infection (BSI) rates, risk factors, and outcome in a cohort of 298 adult and pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital from September 1999 through June 2003. Methods. Prospective surveillance study. BSI rates are reported per 10,000 HSCT days. Date of engraftment is defined as the first of at least 3 consecutive dates of absolute neutrophil count >500/mm(3) after stem cell infusion. BSI severity grades: severe (intravenous antibiotics), life threatening (sepsis), or fatal (caused or contributed to death). Results. The incidence of pre- and post-engraftment BSI was 22% and 19.5%, respectively. Pre-engraftment highest rates were observed for viridans streptococci (58), Enterobacteriaceae (39), and Enterococcus faecium (34). Post-engraftment rates ranged from 0.2 to 2.9 without any predominant pathogen. In multivariate analyses, pre-engraftment BSI was associated with diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, age >18 years and peripheral blood stem cell graft; post-engraftment BSI was associated with acute graft-versus-host disease, neutropenia, and liver or kidney dysfunction. Attributable mortality was 12.5% and 1.7% for pre- and post-engraftment BSI, respectively. BSI fatality rates were 24% for viridans streptococci, 8% for E. faecium, 11% for Staphylococcus aureus, and 67% for Candida. Conclusions. Pre-engraftment BSI, especially by viridans streptococci and E. faecium, was associated with substantial attributable mortality. Post-engraftment BSI was a marker of post-transplant complications and rarely the primary cause of death.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oral streptogramin antimicrobial, XRP2868, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The comparative in vitro potency of XRP2868, a new oral semisynthetic streptogramin antibiotic, was evaluated against gram-positive bacteria. XRP2868 inhibited all staphylococci at < or = 1 microg/ml and all non-pneumococcal streptococci at < or = 0.25 microg/ml and was fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - Nosocomial infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci at a university hospital in Taiwan from 1991 to 2003: resistance trends, antibiotic usage and in vitro activities of newer antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A rapid increase of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection (from 39% in 1991 to 75% in 2003) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (from 1.2% in 1996 to 6.1% in 2003) at a university hospital in Taiwan was found. The noticeable rise of MRSA and VRE was significantly correlated with the increased consumption of glycopeptides, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (Pearson's correlation coefficient, P < 0.05). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 100 non-duplicate blood isolates of MRSA (in 2003) and of 25 non-duplicate isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and 172 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (in 1996-2003) causing nosocomial infection recovered from various clinical specimens of patients treated at the hospital to nine antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. All of these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by 0.5mg/L of tigecycline, and all MRSA isolates were inhibited by daptomycin 1mg/L, including two isolates of MRSA with heteroresistance to vancomycin. Daptomycin had two-fold better activity against vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (MIC90, 2 mg/L) than against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC90, 4 mg/L). Decreased susceptibilities of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and MRSA to quinupristin/dalfopristin (non-susceptibility 25% and 8%, respectively) were found. Telithromycin had poor activity against the isolates tested (MIC90, 8 mg/L). Linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline may represent therapeutic options for infections caused by these resistant Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Global spread of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium from distinct nosocomial genetic complex.
AB  - Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have caused hospital outbreaks worldwide,  and the vancomycin-resistance gene (vanA) has crossed genus boundaries to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Spread of VRE, therefore, represents an immediate threat for patient care and creates a reservoir of mobile resistance genes for other, more virulent pathogens. Evolutionary genetics, population structure, and geographic distribution of 411 VRE and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium isolates, recovered from human and nonhuman sources and community and hospital reservoirs in 5 continents, identified a genetic lineage of E. faecium (complex-17) that has spread globally. This lineage is characterized by 1) ampicillin resistance, 2) a pathogenicity island, and 3) an association with hospital outbreaks. Complex-17 is an example of cumulative evolutionary processes that improved the relative fitness of bacteria in hospital environments. Preventing further spread of this epidemic E. faecium subpopulation is critical, and efforts should focus on the early disclosure of ampicillin-resistant complex-17 strains.
TI  - [Microbiological external quality assurance program (MEQAP)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some Gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. All laboratories engaged in this study received 3 strains: S. aureus (S. aureus SC+ CF+, resistant to methicillin., or S. aureus SC - CF+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis or S. haemolyticus or S. saprophyticus) and Enterococcus sp. (E. faecalis HLAR-positive or E. faecalis HLAR-negative or E. faecium or E. gallinarum). All these strains previously were identified in Department of Bacteriology of National Institute of Hygiene. Of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. Among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by E. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). The determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the NCCLS and national recommendations. Some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.
TI  - Sporolides A and B: structurally unprecedented halogenated macrolides from the marine actinomycete Salinispora tropica.
AB  - [structure: see text] Analysis of the fermentation broth of a strain of the marine actinomycete Salinispora tropica has led to the isolation of two unprecedented macrolides, sporolides A (1) and B (2). The structures and absolute stereochemistries of both metabolites were elucidated using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.
TI  - Linezolid for the treatment of a heteroresistant Staphylococcus aureus shunt infection.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria as the cause of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections is a disconcerting phenomenon that often requires the use of alternative antimicrobials due to resistance against commonly used agents. The following is a case report describing the successful treatment of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection caused by a heteroresistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus with linezolid. Linezolid may have utility in treating pediatric CNS infections due to its tolerability, excellent blood-brain barrier penetration, and activity against multiple resistant Gram-positive organisms such as S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Multiple-locus variable number tandem repeats analysis for genetic fingerprinting of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - DNA fingerprinting has attracted considerable interest as means for identifying,  tracing and preventing the dissemination of infectious agents. Various methods have been developed for typing of pathogenic bacteria, which differ in discriminative power, reproducibility and ease of interpretation. During recent years a typing method, which uses the information provided by whole genome sequencing of bacterial species, has gained increased attention. Short sequence repeat (SSR) motifs are known to undergo frequent variation in the number of repeated units through cellular mechanisms most commonly active during chromosome replication. A class of SSRs, named variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), has proven to be a suitable target for assessing genetic polymorphisms within bacterial species. This review attempts to give an overview of bacterial agents where VNTR-based typing, or multiple-locus variant-repeat analysis (MLVA) has been developed for typing purposes, together with addressing advantages and drawbacks associated with the use of tandem repeated DNA motifs as targets for bacterial typing and identification.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of polypeptide dhvar4].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial activity and the cytotoxicity of polypeptide dhvar4. METHODS: Solid-phase synthesized dhvar4 was manufactured by MeiLian Biotech Co. Ltd.; we evaluated its antibacterial effect, using the growth curve of bacteria after the bacteria being treated with different concentration of dhvar4. The cytotoxicity of dhvar4 on L-02, ECV-304, 293, 3T3 cells was investigated by MTT assay, and human erythrocytes were subimitted to hemolytic assay. RESULTS: dhvar4 inhibited the growth of Enterococcus faecium 36418 and Staphylococcus aureus BAA42 only at the concentration of 4 microg/ml. The viability of mammalian cells remained 68%-92% even when the concentration of dhvar4 reached 150 microg/ml. The LD50 (median lethal dose) was determined to be higher than 150 microg/ml. And very low hemolytic activity of dhvar4 was detected even at the highest protein concentration tested (180 microg/ml). CONCLUSION: dhvar4 possesses antibacterial activity and has little cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. These results suggest that dhvar4 has great potential in the development of
TI  - Bloodstream infection after umbilical cord blood transplantation using reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation for adult patients.
AB  - Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (CBT). However, little information has been reported on BSI after reduced-intensity CBT (RI-CBT). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). Preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan 80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 Gy. Prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. BSI developed within 100 days of RI-CBT in 32 patients. The cumulative incidence of BSI was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. The median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). Causative organisms included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Enterococcus faecium (n = 4), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). Of the 32 patients with BSI, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after RI-CBT. BSI was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). Univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. BSI clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after RI-CBT. Further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of BSI, and establish therapeutic strategies.
TI  - The need for new therapeutic agents: what is the pipeline?
AB  - There is a clinical need for new treatment options for serious Gram-positive infections. Recently introduced agents such as the newer fluoroquinolones and the ketolide telithromycin have limited use as they do not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE). The clinical use of the streptogramin combination quinupristin/dalfopristin, which has activity against MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, is limited because administration is via a slow infusion of a large volume. The oxazolidinone linezolid is active against MRSA and GRE but resistant organisms and treatment failures have been reported. A number of compounds currently in development show promise, the new glycopeptides oritavancin, dalbavancin and the glycolipodepsipeptide ramoplanin, as well as the new tetracyclines tigecycline and BAY73-7388. However, in some cases, there is concern that resistance may develop quickly to new compounds that are based on existing antimicrobial agents. Therefore daptomycin, a novel lipopeptide with a unique mode of action, is of particular interest. Daptomycin is active against MRSA (including vancomycin-resistant strains) and GRE. Daptomycin displays rapid concentration-dependent killing and is bactericidal even in the stationary phase of growth. Daptomycin-resistant strains are very difficult to generate in vitro. A dosage of 4 mg/kg intravenous once a day has been shown to be efficacious in two evaluator-blinded trials of complicated skin and soft tissue infections with clinical success rates similar for daptomycin and comparators (vancomycin or penicillinase-resistant penicillins). With its activity against key Gram-positive pathogens, including resistant strains, daptomycin has potential as a valuable addition to the available treatment options for serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Trends in linezolid susceptibility patterns in 2002: report from the worldwide Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program.
AB  - Oxazolidinones have become reliable clinical and candidate antimicrobial agents to be utilized for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive cocci, especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. However, mutational resistance of the ribosomal target has been described for several species. Longitudinal surveillance remains necessary to monitor for this evolving linezolid resistance pattern. A survey of linezolid and several comparison Gram-positive focused agents was initiated in 2002 (7971 strains, >99.0% compliance) for 54 participating sites in the United States, Canada, Europe (6 nations), Latin America (2 nations), and the Asia Pacific (2 nations). The 5 and 25 sites in Canada and the United States, respectively, submitted 200 strains each to a central laboratory for organism identification/confirmation and reference MIC processing. The 10 remaining nations had 200 strain samples from 1 to 4 separate institutions. Linezolid resistance (MIC >/= 8 microg/mL) was confirmed by alternative susceptibility testing methods (Etest, AB BIO Disk, Solna, Sweden; disk diffusion method) and target mutation characterization by PCR and sequence analysis. Linezolid activity against the 6 major organism groups did not vary between geographic areas. A total of 98.1% of linezolid MIC values were between 0.5 and 2 microg/mL, and only 0.5% of results were at 4 microg/mL, which included 32 Staphylococcus aureus (0.9%) and 5 (0.5%) enterococcal isolates. Linezolid resistance was detected in only 4 isolates (0.05%): 1 each Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and a viridans group Streptococcus. All 4 isolates had a G2576U mutation in the 23S rRNA target. Linezolid activity as outlined by these Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program results demonstrate sustained, near complete activity against contemporary Gram-positive isolates on 4 monitored continents and in centers utilizing oxazolidinones. Rare linezolid-resistant strains were identified in the United States only (0.05% resistance overall).
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin versus linezolid and vancomycin against gram-positive uropathogens and ampicillin against enterococci, causing complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The existing therapeutic options for complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by gram-positive uropathogens are not always optimal. Therefore, newer antimicrobials have to be assessed. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of daptomycin was tested versus linezolid, vancomycin, and ampicillin (enterococci on ly), against pathogens from three different collections: (1) Uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients with complicated and/or hospital-acquired UTIs of the Urologic Clinic, Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. (2) Uropathogens from a multicenter study comprising 37 urological centers throughout Germany. (3) Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates of patients and staff within the Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. Genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of daptomycin, linezolid, vancomycin, and ampicillin (only tested against enterococci) were determined by an agar dilution method using a multipointer with an inoculum of 10(4) CFU per point. RESULTS: For all methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 25), MRSA (n = 49), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 129), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 33), for Enterococcus faecalis (n = 289), and for Enterococcus faecium (n = 4) the MICs ranged up to 2 mg/l (daptomycin, linezolid), up to 4 mg/l (vancomycin), and up to 8 mg/l (ampicillin, enterococci only) indicating that all strains were susceptible to the antibiotics tested. CONCLUSIONS: According to the in vitro activity daptomycin may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated UTI caused by gram-positive uropathogens. Thus, daptomycin should be evaluated in a clinical study.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium GM-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  - AIM: To partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the GM-1 strain of Enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteriocin produced by E. faecium GM-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio spp., Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Treatment of the GM-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. The bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees C for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral pH. The optimal production of bacteriocin from E. faecium GM-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were pH 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. The use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. A bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin P was identified from the total DNA of E. faecium GM-1 by PCR and direct sequencing methods. CONCLUSION: E. faecium GM-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin P-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: E. faecium GM-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin P. This bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Human defensins.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. The eukaryotic antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. The mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. Mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal Paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. Recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human beta-defensin-3 (HBD-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (HBD-4) have been discovered. Similar to HBD-1 and HBD-2, HBD-3 has microbicidal activity towards the Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and the yeasts Candida albicans and Malassezia furfur. In addition, HBD-3 kills Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant S. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. In contrast to HBD-1 and HBD-2, significant expression of HBD-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. HBD-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. Its bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. Here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.
TI  - Daptomycin: a new drug class for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
AB  - Daptomycin is the first member of a new class of bactericidal antibiotics, the cyclic lipopeptides. In September 2003, daptomycin was approved for the treatment of Gram-positive infections associated with complicated skin and skin structure infections. A key feature of daptomycin is its rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against significant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-intermediate and -resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (VRE). Daptomycin also has a unique mechanism of action, no cross-resistance with any other class of antibiotic and a relatively prolonged concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect in vitro. In the United States, daptomycin has been approved for use at a dose of 4 mg/ kg once daily in the treatment of S. aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), three beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) and E. faecalis associated with complicated skin and skin structure infections. In addition, daptomycin is undergoing a phase III evaluation for the treatment of bacteremia and endocarditis due to S. aureus. With its once-daily dosing, favorable safety profile and low potential for resistance, daptomycin is a powerful new antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Diversifying vancomycin via chemoenzymatic strategies.
AB  - [reaction: see text] The rapid diversification of glycopeptides via glycorandomization reveals that significantly diverse substitutions are tolerated and suggests there may be a synergistic benefit to the construction of mechanistically related natural product core scaffold fusions. This work also further highlights the utility of chemoenzymatic approaches to diversify complex natural product architectures.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of linezolid and vancomycin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model of gram-positive catheter-related bacteraemia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the activity of linezolid and vancomycin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model to assess potential differences in activity against biofilm-embedded organisms. METHODS: Single-lumen central venous catheters colonized with biofilm-embedded Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) were treated with simulated clinical dosing regimens of linezolid 600 mg every 12 h or vancomycin 1 g every 12 h in a one-compartment in vitro pharmacodynamic model. Quantitative cultures were sampled through the catheter and peripheral ports over 48 h to dynamically assess changes in the burden of catheter colonization and organism seeding, respectively. At 24 and 48 h catheters were removed, sonicated and cultured for adherent organisms. RESULTS: Both linezolid and vancomycin suppressed bacterial growth on the catheter and release of S. aureus and S. epidermidis into the model compared with controls (P < 0.05), while linezolid also suppressed counts compared with control and vancomycin versus VRE. Neither agent completely eradicated bacterial colonization of the catheters. MICs for the isolates recovered from the model did not increase over time with linezolid or vancomycin exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of activity against biofilm-embedded organisms appeared to be the primary reason for microbiological failure of both drugs in the model.
TI  - Efficacy of current agents used in the treatment of Gram-positive infections and  the consequences of resistance.
AB  - The proportion of pathogens causing hospital-onset infections that are resistant  to antimicrobial agents continues to increase worldwide. Inadequate antimicrobial therapy is an important factor in the emergence of resistance and is associated with increased mortality. In the USA in 2000, the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance system reported that >50% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from intensive care units were resistant to methicillin (MRSA). The emergence of community-acquired MRSA is a new concern. MRSA are associated with adverse clinical outcomes and increased hospital costs. The increasing prevalence of MRSA contributes to the use of glycopeptides; however, isolates with intermediate and full resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin are now being reported. Newer agents, such as the oxazolidinone linezolid, are effective in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections; however, linezolid-resistant isolates of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus have been reported. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for new agents with activity against Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin, a lipopeptide with a novel mode of action, was recently approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in the USA. The two case studies presented herein detail experience with the use of daptomycin in the USA.
TI  - [Inhibition of hemolytic activity of Staphylococcus aureus 3-hemolysin by an exosubstance produced by some Enterococcus faecalis strains].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accidentally, some Enterococcus faecalis strains were found to inhibit the hemolysis caused by Staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. The study objectives were to define the conditions under which this phenomenon appears and to characterize the inhibitory agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-one wild strains and five type strains of E. faecalis and nine wild E. faecium strains were tested for antihemolytic activity on blood agar with 5% sheep erythrocytes prepared using the following agar bases: Columbia Agar Base (BBL, 211124), Columbia Agar (Bio Merieux, 51026), Blood Agar Base (Bio-Rad, 64524), Blood Agar Base (Columbia) (Ferosa, 1-034), Columbia Blood Agar Base (HiMedia, M114), Blood Agar Base No. 4 (Imuna), Columbia Agar Base (Merck, 10455) and Columbia Agar Base (Oxoid, CM331). The exosubstance produced by E. faecalis strains was isolated by means of acetone precipitation and was exposed to elevated temperature and trypsin. RESULTS: Thirty-three (36%) out of 91 wild strains of E. faecalis produced the substance inhibiting hemolysis caused by Staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. Two out of five E. faecalis type strains and none of E. faecium strains appeared to be producers of the same substance. Inhibition of the hemolysis was observed on all of the media tested, being the most pronounced with the use of Blood Agar Base No. 4 (Imuna) and Columbia Agar Base (BBL) at pH 7.0-7.5 when cultured at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. The exosubstance lost its inhibitory effect after exposure to 70 degrees C for 15 min and to 0.1% trypsin for 30 min. The inhibitory potential against staphylococcal hemolysis correlated with the ability of strains to produce protease. CONCLUSION: About one third of wild E. faecalis strains produce a protease-like substance that seems proteinaceous in nature and has an inhibitory effect on the hemolysis caused by Staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin.
TI  - Survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  - In 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  We assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS). Methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most common gram-positive species was Enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (BLs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. The proportion of FQ-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). All the ESBL-producing strains (ESBLs) possess resistance to FQs. Over 95% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. The distribution of antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. Some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among Proteus species. No ESBL-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from Serratia marcescens. This survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of ESBL-producing or FQs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in obese patients with cellulitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial with excellent oral bioavailability and tissue penetration and is active against multidrug-resistant skin/soft tissue pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To study the pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity of linezolid against selective skin/soft tissue pathogens in obese patients. METHODS: We obtained multiple serum samples from 7 obese patients (>50% over their calculated ideal body weight) receiving oral linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours for treatment of cellulitis. Following a minimum of 3 doses, serum concentrations of linezolid were measured in each subject prior to (trough) and 1 and 6 hours after a dose. These samples were then tested against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microg/mL) and one strain each of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) (MIC 2.0 microg/mL), Bacteroides fragilis (MIC 2.0 microg/mL), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (MIC 1.0 microg/mL). Serum inhibitory titers (SITs) and bactericidal titers (SBTs) were measured at each time point, and the median activity for these 7 patients was calculated. RESULTS: Mean linezolid serum concentrations were 4.2, 12.3, and 7.2 microg/mL at these respective time points. Median SITs for 12 hours (100% of the dosing interval) were observed against each organism with the exception of the least susceptible strain of MRSA (MIC 4.0 microg/mL); serum inhibitory activity was observed only at the one-hour time point against this isolate. Furthermore, prolonged (> or =6 h) median SBTs were observed against one isolate of MRSA (MIC 1.0 microg/mL) as well as the strain of VRE and P. magnus. CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of oral linezolid in this patient population were diminished compared with those of healthy volunteers, but still provided prolonged serum inhibitory activity against common pathogens associated with skin/soft tissue infections. One treatment concern would be an obese patient receiving oral linezolid who was infected with a less susceptible (MIC > or =4.0 microg/mL) strain of S. aureus. Bactericidal activity was also observed against selective pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical investigation of Brazilian Drosera.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of three different extracts (hexanic, ethyl acetate, methanol) obtained from Brazilian Drosera species (D. communis, D. montana var. montana, D. brevifolia, D. villosa var. graomogolensis, D. villosa var. villosa, Drosera sp. 1, and Drosera sp. 2 ) were tested against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecium (ATCC23212), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC11229), Salmonella choleraesuis (ATCC10708), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC13883), and Candida albicans (a human isolate). Better antimicrobial activity was observed with D. communis and D. montana var. montana ethyl acetate extracts. Phytochemical analyses from D. communis, D. montana var. montana and D. brevifolia yielded 5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (plumbagin); long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons were isolated from D. communis and from D. villosa var. villosa, a mixture of long chain aliphatic alcohols and carboxylic acids, was isolated from D. communis and 3b-O-acetylaleuritolic acid from D. villosa var. villosa.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid & quinupristin/dalfopristin against Gram-positive  cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Since the incidence of vancomycin- and methicillin-resistant Gram-positive infections continue to increase, novel antimicrobials such as linezolid and streptogramin may provide new options to treat patients. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium resistant to glycopeptides, coagulase negative staphylococci and S. aureus resistant to methicillin isolated mainly from blood and also rectal swab cultures of patients against quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid. METHODS: The in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin for a total of 332 isolates of Gram-positive cocci [127 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 109 methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (71 S. epidermidis, 38 S. haemolyticus) and 96 vanA genotype vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium] was investigated by E test. RESULTS: All MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MICs < 4.0 mg/l). Ninety per cent of VRE isolates were inhibited by linezolid at concentration of 2.0 mg/l and presented similar activities to quinupristin/dalfopristin. MICs for quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci were also low (MIC(90) = 1.0 mg/l for both MRSA and MRCoNS isolates). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrated that quinupristin/ dalfopristin and linezolid, have good in vitro activity against MRSA, MRCoNS and vancomycin resistant E. faecium in Turkey. These drugs could be promising therapeutic options in an era of rapidly growing antibiotic resistance in all parts of world.
TI  - Enhanced resistance to erythromycin is conferred by the enterococcal msrC determinant in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The msrC gene, found on the chromosome of Enterococcus faecium, shares a high degree of similarity with the staphylococcal erythromycin resistance determinant msr(A). The enterococcal determinant was cloned into Staphylococcus aureus to determine whether msrC could confer antibiotic resistance in staphylococci. METHODS: A shuttle vector comprising pBluescript and pSK265 was used to introduce multiple copies of msrC into S. aureus RN4220. The integration vector pCL84 was employed to insert a single copy of msrC into the S. aureus chromosome. MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Expression of msrC from both chromosomal and plasmid loci in erythromycin-susceptible S. aureus RN4220 (MIC 0.25 mg/L) gave rise to enhanced protection against erythromycin, with an MIC of 32-64 mg/L for S. aureus RN4220 containing msrC in multiple copies and an MIC of 16-64 mg/L with msrC inserted as a single copy in the S. aureus chromosome. CONCLUSIONS: MsrC mediates high-level resistance to erythromycin in S. aureus.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - [Salicylanilides: still a potential antibacterially active group].
AB  - The review presents a survey of potential biologically active salicylanilides, focusing particularly on their antibacterial activity. Emergence of bacterial resistance to a large number of antibacterial agents represents a major world-wide problem. On that account, perpetual attention is paid to the preparation of new bioactive antibacterial compounds. Salicylanilides belong to the group of compounds that have shown activity against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, the strains representing the most significant problem in clinical practice. In 1998, a new mechanism of their action was proposed. Salicylanilides are inhibitors of two-component regulatory systems in bacteria. Electron-accepting substituents on the salicylic and hydrophobic groups on the anilide ring are most essential for the activity, but other electronic and structural parameters may also play an important role. Our aim, based on SAR analysis, is to develop new active drugs esterified by amino acid and later peptides. Furthermore, analogues carrying the hydroxybenzamide moiety may uncouple oxidative phosphorylation.
TI  - Detection of the van alphabet and identification of enterococci and staphylococci at the species level by multiplex PCR.
AB  - A multiplex PCR assay was developed for detection of the six types of glycopeptide resistance characterized in enterococci and for identification of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis at the species level. Primers targeting the genes vanA, vanB, vanC, vanD, vanE, vanG, and ddl of E. faecium and E. faecalis and nuc of S. aureus and a chromosomal portion specific to S. epidermidis were designed to allow amplification of fragments with various sizes. This specific and sensitive technique allows detection of glycopeptide-resistant strains, in particular methicillin-resistant S. aureus, that may escape phenotype-based automated rapid methods.
TI  - An alcohol hand rub containing a synergistic combination of an emollient and preservatives: prolonged activity against transient pathogens.
AB  - A new alcohol-based hand antiseptic (Octoxy hand rub) containing a synergistic combination of an emollient (Octoxyglycerine) and preservatives was developed and evaluated for immediate and prolonged activity against transient bacteria. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy was compared with other alcohol hand rubs containing preservative/antimicrobial (Prevacare and Avagard). In vitro evaluation was carried out using a tube-dilution method and a pig-skin model. Rapid and prolonged efficacy in vivo was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis on the hands of volunteers. Octoxy hand rub was 100% effective in rapidly killing pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in vitro. In volunteers, all three hand rubs gave a significant reduction in microbial count within 15s. Octoxy hand rub showed significantly higher efficacy against S. aureus and Escherichia coli than Avagard and Prevacare 15 min after application to the pig-skin model, and against S. epidermidis in both the pig-skin model and in volunteers. Use of Octoxy hand rub with broad-spectrum immediate and prolonged antimicrobial activity may be a very effective way of improving hand hygiene without exposing the hands to higher concentrations of antimicrobials.
TI  - Heart transplantation in the patient under ventricular assist complicated with device-related infection.
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have benefited patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). We present our experience of HTx in the presence of device-related infection (DRI) including driveline exit site with pocket infections. From May 1996 to April 2003, mechanical circulatory support with the HeartMate VAD was performed in eight patients, and with the Thoratec VAD in seven patients. Although 151 patients underwent HTx during that period, only 8 of the 15 patients had suitable donors and underwent orthotopic HTx. Six of the eight patients developed DRI. Their ages ranged from 18 to 59 years (mean = 36 +/- 14 years). The duration of VAD support ranged from 8 to 287 days (mean = 125 +/- 117 days). The general condition and cardiac function improved gradually under VAD support. At the time of HTx, all six male patients were suffering from DRI. The causative microorganisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 3) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 1). All patients underwent successful HTx, and were discharged in good condition. It is concluded that under the coverage of appropriate antibiotics, HTx can be successfully performed for the patients for VAD support with DRI. It is important to prevent the spread of infection during HTx. Adequate debridement and drainage of the infected materials prevents postoperative wound infections.
TI  - [The frequency of resistance to antibiotics of most frequently isolated bacteria  from blood cultures during the period 1997-2002].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of resistance to antibiotics of the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures of hospitalized patients during the period 1997-2002. The resistance to antibiotics was determined by disk diffusion method according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards procedures. The majority of staphylococci isolates were resistant to methicillin, and the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was stable (76.8-81.6%), during the follow-up period. None of the staphylococci isolates were resistant to vancomycin, but there was a very high incidence of high-level resistance of enterococci to aminoglycosides (47.2-72.2%). In 1998, only one strain among enterococci was resistant to vancomycin (Enterococcus faecium, VanA phenotype). Enterococcus spp isolates expressed variable frequency of resistance to ampicillin (15-40.1%) during the follow-up period. Among Enterobacteriaceae there were no isolates resistant to imipenem, but dramatic increase of the resistance to ceftriaxone was found from 35.9% in 1997 to 95.9% in 2002 (p<0.001). Extended spectrum beta-lactamases production was found in all the species of enterobacteria isolates. Resistance to imipenem was observed in Acinetobacter spp isolates in 2002 for the first time. Pseudomonas spp isolates expressed high and very variable resistance to all antibiotics tested during the follow-up period.
TI  - Successful treatment of chronic bone and joint infections with oral linezolid.
AB  - Linezolid is an attractive alternative for the treatment of chronic bone and joint infections because it is active against common pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and because its oral formulation is convenient for long-term administration. To evaluate the ability of linezolid to produce long-term remission, we prospectively monitored 11 consecutive adult patients who received linezolid for osteomyelitis (n = 9) or prosthetic joint infection (n = 2). Linezolid 600 mg was administered orally twice daily for a mean of 10 weeks (range, 6 to 19 weeks). Pathogens were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 4), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). After a mean followup of 27 months (range, 17 to 41 months), all 11 patients had remission by clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria. During week 8 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed a gram-negative superinfection, which resolved with appropriate therapy. During week 6 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed mild thrombocytopenia and another patient developed mild anemia. Both episodes of myelosuppression were reversible within 10 days after completing the planned 6-week courses of linezolid. We recommend weekly complete blood counts to detect hematologic abnormalities. We conclude that oral linezolid seems to be a useful and convenient alternative for the treatment of bone and joint infections.
TI  - Potent antibacterial activity of halogenated compounds against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Common Gram-positive clinical pathogens are showing an increasing trend for resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents. New drugs with potent antibacterial activities are urgently needed to remediate this problem. Halogenated compounds isolated from several species of the red algae genus Laurencia were examined for their antibacterial activity against 22 strains of human pathogenic bacteria, 7 strains of which were antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Four phenolic sesquiterpenes and a polybrominated indole showed wide spectra of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (VRE). In addition, laurinterol and allolaurinterol displayed potent bactericidal activity against three strains of MRSA at 3.13 microg mL(-1), and three strains of vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus, at 3.13 microg mL(-1) and 6.25 microg mL(-1), respectively.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides exhibit synergistic, broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are known to have antiviral, antibiotic and antitumour properties. The aim of this study was to determine the combined effects of cyclo(L-leucyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl) on the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and pathogenic yeasts, as well as determining their anti-mutagenic effects. This drug combination was especially effective against five VRE strains: Enterococcus faecium (K-99-38), E. faecalis (K-99-17), E. faecalis (K-99-258), E. faecium (K-01-312) and E. faecalis (K-01-511) with MIC values of 0.25-1 mg/l. It was also effective against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans with MIC values of 0.25-0.5 mg/l. In addition, the cyclic dipeptides exerted anti-mutagenic activity against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains in a Salmonella mutation assay. The number of mutant colonies of S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 induced by exposure to AF-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the two cyclic dipeptides (correlation 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). Here, for the first time, we report synergistic effects of the cyclic dipeptides [cyclo(L-leu-L-pro) and cyclo(L-phe-L-pro)] in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their anti-mutagenic effects in Salmonella strains.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Usnic acid, a natural antimicrobial agent able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on polymer surfaces.
AB  - In modern medicine, artificial devices are used for repair or replacement of damaged parts of the body, delivery of drugs, and monitoring the status of critically ill patients. However, artificial surfaces are often susceptible to colonization by bacteria and fungi. Once microorganisms have adhered to the surface, they can form biofilms, resulting in highly resistant local or systemic infections. At this time, the evidence suggests that (+)-usnic acid, a secondary lichen metabolite, possesses antimicrobial activity against a number of planktonic gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Since lichens are surface-attached communities that produce antibiotics, including usnic acid, to protect themselves from colonization by other bacteria, we hypothesized that the mode of action of usnic acid may be utilized in the control of medical biofilms. We loaded (+)-usnic acid into modified polyurethane and quantitatively assessed the capacity of (+)-usnic acid to control biofilm formation by either S. aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa under laminar flow conditions by using image analysis. (+)-Usnic acid-loaded polymers did not inhibit the initial attachment of S. aureus cells, but killing the attached cells resulted in the inhibition of biofilm. Interestingly, although P. aeruginosa biofilms did form on the surface of (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymer, the morphology of the biofilm was altered, possibly indicating that (+)-usnic acid interfered with signaling pathways.
TI  - In vitro testing of antimicrobial activity of bone cement.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable and cost-effective microplate proliferation assay for in vitro antimicrobial testing of bone cement samples. Cement samples devoid of antimicrobial agents, loaded with 2% gentamicin or with different concentrations of high-porosity silver, were incubated in a 96-well microplate with several staphylococcal, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibiting different susceptibilities to gentamicin. After being rinsed, the samples were brought into a soy medium in which adherent cells on the cement surface either were killed by the antimicrobial surface or started to release clonal counterparts. The medium was monitored in real time by recording a time proliferation curve for each well. Microplate testing revealed no antibacterial effect of plain bone cement. The antibacterial activity of gentamicin-loaded bone cement was shown by the microplate test to depend on the gentamicin susceptibilities of the strains. The effect of high-porosity silver was dose dependent. Bactericidal activity against all tested strains was found for bone cement loaded with 1% high-porosity silver. The accuracy of this new proliferation assay was shown by the high correlation between the types of proliferation curves and antibiotic susceptibility. In contrast to routine agar diffusion testing, it assesses the dynamic response of microorganisms to antimicrobial agents in biomaterials and allows high-throughput screening and detection of antimicrobial properties of poorly water-soluble compounds like silver.
TI  - A novel antimicrobial indolizinium alkaloid from Aniba panurensis.
AB  - Activity-guided fractionation of an Aniba panurensis organic solvent extract has  led to the isolation of the novel alkaloid 6,8-didec-(1Z)-enyl-5,7-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indolizinium, as the trifluoroacetic acid salt (1). Its structure was determined by NMR and mass spectrometry. Bioassays performed in vitro demonstrated toxicity of compound 1 to a drug-resistant strain of Candida albicans.
TI  - A review of linezolid: the first oxazolidinone antibiotic.
AB  - Resistance of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, to existing antibiotics continues to increase, and new antibiotics with activity against these pathogens are in demand. Linezolid (Zyvox, Pharmacia and Upjohn) is the first agent of a new class of antibiotics called the oxazolidinones. Linezolid possesses excellent microbial activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive pathogens including those resistant to methicillin and vancomycin (Vancocin, Eli Lilly). Linezolid is available for intravenous and oral administration and possesses excellent bioavailability. It exhibits good penetration into pulmonary, as well as skin and related structure tissues, and does not require dosage adjustment in hepatic or renal dysfunction. Linezolid is generally well-tolerated, with the predominant adverse effect manifesting as a duration dependent, reversible thrombocytopenia. Linezolid possesses monoamine oxidase inhibitor activity and caution is warranted with coadministration of adrenergic or seritonergic medications. Clinical trials conducted with linezolid in skin and structure infections, lower respiratory tract infections and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections demonstrate that linezolid is an effective therapy. Recent data suggest that linezolid may be superior to vancomycin for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Linezolid is an excellent and promising new antibiotic for the treatment of resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - International dissemination of antibiotic resistant strains of bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The increasing incidence of methicillin and multiple resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in nosocomial infections is mainly associated with a wide, international dissemination of well defined clonal lineages (epidemic MRSA) which are clearly different from community acquired MRSA by molecular typing patterns and structure of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome containing the mecA gene. Although belonging to a definite subpopulation within the species Enterococcus faecium, hospital associated vancomycin resistant isolates also containing the esp gene have very likely evolved by acquisition of glycopeptide resistance gene clusters at different occasions and at different times by a susceptible already disseminated clonal lineage. There is obviously a continuous selection of new types of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae and also horizontal spread of bla-genes. Intrahospital dissemination of particular strains has often been observed, however, an international dissemination until now has been described only for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium producing the CTX-M-3 enzyme. Multiresistant isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium phage type DT104 harbour a multiresistant gene cluster with resistance genes from taxonomically more unrelated species (tetG, floR, bla(PSE1)). Although in vitro transduction has been demonstrated, this gene cluster has only rarely been reported from isolates exhibiting other phage patterns of the same serovar or from other serovars of S. enterica.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of nocathiacins, a thiazole peptide class of antibiotics.
AB  - Nocathiacins are cyclic thiazolyl peptides with inhibitory activity against gram-positive bacteria. BMS-249524 (nocathiacin I), identified from screening a library of compounds against a multiply antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain, was used as a lead chemotype to obtain additional structurally related compounds. The MIC assay results of BMS-249524 and two more water-soluble derivatives, BMS-411886 and BMS-461996, revealed potent in vitro activities against a variety of gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin intermediate-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium. Analysis of killing kinetics revealed that these compounds are bactericidal for S. aureus with at least a 3-log(10) reduction of bacterial growth within 6 h of exposure to four times the MICs. Nocathiacin-resistant mutants were characterized by DNA sequence analyses. The mutations mapped to the rplK gene encoding the L11 ribosomal protein in the 50S subunit in a region previously shown to be involved in the binding of related thiazolyl peptide antibiotics. These compounds demonstrated potential for further development as a new class of antibacterial agents with activity against key antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Activity of daptomycin against multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria including enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to linezolid.
AB  - The activity of daptomycin was assessed against 545 isolates of Gram-positive bacteria including enterococci, coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci and coryneforms. The panel of isolates was biased towards those with resistance to first-line antimicrobial agents and included linezolid-resistant enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. MICs of daptomycin were < or =1mg/l for all the staphylococci, streptococci, and coryneforms, except for two isolates of Corynebacterium aquaticum, for which MICs were 8 mg/l. Daptomycin MICs were < or =2 and < or =4 mg/l for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively.
TI  - In vitro assessment of chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated polyurethane foam antimicrobial dressing using zone of inhibition assays.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an antimicrobial dressing consisting of hydrophilic polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate for activity against several antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates as well as American Type Culture Collection reference strains using zone of inhibition assays. METHODS: Sterile foam samples with chlorhexidine gluconate and untreated controls were transferred onto inoculated agar plates. Plates were incubated at 35 degrees C to 37 degrees C for 24 hours and examined for zones of inhibition around the foam samples. RESULTS: Polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate showed antimicrobial activity in vitro against all of the challenge organisms including antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: The data from this in vitro study support the hypothesis that polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate has an antimicrobial effect against antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species, as well as Candida species.
TI  - Bacteriology and somatic cell counts in milk samples from ewes on a Scottish farm.
AB  - Milk samples from 50 sheep on a single Scottish research farm were collected weekly for 10 wk postpartum. Samples were analyzed for somatic cell counts (SCC) each week and bacteriologic culture was done for 7 of the 10 wk. A total of 492 udder half samples were cultured, of which 467 had corresponding cell count data. Statistical analysis on complete SCC and culture data showed no association between SCC and bacterial isolation, even when more than 10 colonies of a single bacterial species were present. Only 3.6% of the samples were simultaneously positive for high count (> 10 colonies from 0.01 mL of milk) of any one bacterial species and high SCC (> 1 x 10(6)/mL). The bacteria recovered were: Staphylococcus equorum (19 times), S. xylosus (7 times), S. simulans (6 times), Streptococcus uberis (3 times) and other streptococci (4 times), Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica (2 times), Staphylococcus aureus (1 time), S. capitis (1 time), and Enterococcus faecium (1 time). There was an association between the test day and SCC, with higher SCC values in the first 2 wk. In addition, significantly higher SCC values were found in the oldest animals compared to the other age groups.
TI  - [Antibacterial effectiveness of high-energetic extracorporeal shock waves: an in  vitro verification].
AB  - AIM: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is used for a multitude of different indications in modern orthopedics. Local bacterial infections, like infected pseudarthrosis, are still considered as contraindications. The goal of the present study was to determine the effect of ESWT on the growth of clinically relevant bacteria in orthopedic and trauma surgery. METHODS: Standardized suspensions of five bacterial strains of bone and implant-associated infections were treated with 4 000 impulses of high-energy shock waves with an energy flux density (ED) of 0.96 mJ/mm (2) and a frequency of 2 Hz. Subsequently, viable bacteria were quantified and compared with an untreated control. RESULTS: A highly significant antibacterial effect of the ESWT was demonstrated for all bacterial strains with a reduction of growth to values between 1.1 % and 29.7 % (p < 0.01). Reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis reacted with the highest sensitivity whereas Enterococcus faecium demonstrated the highest resistance towards high-energy shock waves. CONCLUSION: ESWT proved to exert a significant antibacterial effect on clinically relevant pathogens. Further investigations on energy flux density and impulse rates might contribute to an optimization of the bactericidal effectiveness. Infections as possible indications of the ESWT should therefore be assessed in further studies and the clinical relevance should be verified in an animal model.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in US hospitals: analysis of 24,179 cases from  a prospective nationwide surveillance study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. METHODS: Data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiological Importance [SCOPE]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial BSIs. RESULTS: Our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial BSI in 49 US hospitals over a 7-year period from March 1995 through September 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). Eighty-seven percent of BSIs were monomicrobial. Gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these BSIs, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. The crude mortality rate was 27%. The most-common organisms causing BSIs were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (31% of isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (20%), enterococci (9%), and Candida species (9%). The mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with Escherichia coli, 16 days for S. aureus, 22 days for Candida species and Klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for Acinetobacter species. CoNS, Pseudomonas species, Enterobacter species, Serratia species, and Acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (P<.001). In neutropenic patients, infections with Candida species, enterococci, and viridans group streptococci were significantly more common. The proportion of S. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (P<.001, trend analysis). Vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: In this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial BSIs due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in US hospitals.
TI  - Determining incidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 38 centres from 17 countries: the PEARLS study 2001-2002.
AB  - The PEARLS study prospectively monitored selected nosocomial pathogens from 38 centres in 13 European, three Middle Eastern countries and South Africa during 2001-2002. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production rates among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. were 5.4% (142/2609), 18.2% (401/2,206) and 8.8% (204/2,328), respectively, for all study sites. The overall ESBL production rate for the combined Enterobacteriaceae was 10.5% (747/7,143), highest in Egypt, 38.5%, and Greece, 27.4%, and lowest in The Netherlands, 2.0%, and Germany, 2.6%. IEF, PCR and DNA sequencing determined 10.7% false positives among Enterobacter spp. when using NCCLS guidelines to screen for ESBL production. The prevalence of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was 32.4% (294/908) and 8.7% (83/949), respectively. PEARLS provides baseline data against which prospective changes in resistant determinants and outcomes can be measured in this ongoing study.
TI  - Emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a European and North American Surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally ICUs are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. METHODS: Antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant ICU pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Databases in Europe (France, Germany and Italy), Canada, and the United States (US). RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. Penicillin resistance rates among Streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in Germany to as high as 20.2% in the US; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in Germany to 3.4% in Italy. Vancomycin resistance rates among Enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in France to 76.3% in the United States. Putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among Enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among Escherichia coli in the five countries studied. Ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the Enterobacteriaceae species examined. Fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for E. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), Proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and Morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other Enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). P. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. Imipenem was the most active compound tested against Acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. CONCLUSION: There was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. Compared with other countries, Italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of Enterococcus spp., which were highest in the US. This data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in Europe and North America and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.
TI  - Synthesis of mosaic peptidoglycan cross-bridges by hybrid peptidoglycan assembly  pathways in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The peptidoglycan cross-bridges of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis,  and Enterococcus faecium consist of the sequences Gly(5), l-Ala(2), and d-Asx, respectively. Expression of the fmhB, femA, and femB genes of S. aureus in E. faecalis led to the production of peptidoglycan precursors substituted by mosaic side chains that were efficiently used by the penicillin-binding proteins for cross-bridge formation. The Fem transferases were specific for incorporation of glycyl residues at defined positions of the side chains in the absence of any additional S. aureus factors such as tRNAs used for amino acid activation. The PBPs of E. faecalis displayed a broad substrate specificity because mosaic side chains containing from 1 to 5 residues and Gly instead of l-Ala at the N-terminal position were used for peptidoglycan cross-linking. Low affinity PBP2a of S. aureus conferred beta-lactam resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium, thereby indicating that there was no barrier to heterospecific expression of resistance caused by variations in the structure of peptidoglycan precursors. Thus, conservation of the structure of the peptidoglycan cross-bridges in members of the same species reflects the high specificity of the enzymes for side chain synthesis, although this is not essential for the activity of the PBPs.
TI  - Evaluation of the prevalence and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus among patients on dialysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) has been reported among long-term dialysis patients, although risk factors for VRE colonization are not well defined. This study aims to appraise the prevalence and risk factors for VRE colonization among patients on long-term dialysis therapy, as well as the mechanisms for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey of 320 patients on long-term dialysis therapy at 2 hospitals of the Federal University of Sao Paulo from June 2001 to March 2003. Fecal samples were collected from each patient once a week for 1 month. Samples with positive test results for VRE were submitted to molecular typing through automated ribotyping. RESULTS: VRE prevalence was 14.4%. There were significant associations between VRE and dialysis type (hemodialysis, P = 0.04), number of hospitalizations (P = 0.03), low hemoglobin level (P = 0.03), and leukocytosis (P = 0.05). Among samples with VRE (n = 56), 25% were Enterococcus faecium; 10.7%, Enterococcus casseliflavus; 57.1%, Enterococcus gallinarum; and 3.6%, Enterococcus faecalis. All samples isolated were sensitive to teicoplanin, except for E faecium samples, which were strongly resistant, although 9 of 14 patients with this isolate presented the same ribogroup (111-S-4). Typing of 6 samples from 8 dialysis patients with E gallinarum was performed, showing a predominant ribogroup (112-S-4). CONCLUSION: Hospital environment, hemodialysis, anemia, and leukocytosis appear to be associated with VRE colonization. These results suggest that dissemination of these bacteria among patients on long-term dialysis therapy may be taking place.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Daptomycin in vitro susceptibility in European Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the activity of daptomycin, a novel  lipopeptide, against European Gram-positive isolates (n = 1539). The MIC(90)-values of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus isolates was 0.25 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecalis 4 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecium 8 mg/L, 0.25 mg/L against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 0.25mg/L against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Daptomycin was equally potent against antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains within a particular species. Based on a breakpoint of 1 mg/L for S. aureus and group A streptococci, all isolates tested were susceptible to daptomycin. Based on a breakpoint of 4 mg/L for vancomcyin-susceptible E. faecalis 99.7% of these isolates were susceptible to daptomycin.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  - Immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. This study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ATCC 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. L. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. The antimicrobial potential of immobilized L. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus) or Pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. Results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized L. lactis inhibited the growth of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus sakei, Kocuria varians, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. With the addition of 10 mM of a chelating agent (EDTA) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of E. coli; however, P. putida and Salmonella Typhi were unaffected by this treatment. These results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial growth in semisolid synthetic media.
TI  - Bacillus clausii probiotic strains: antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities.
AB  - The clinical benefits observed with probiotic use are mainly attributed to the antimicrobial substances produced by probiotic strains and to their immunomodulatory effects. Currently, the best-documented probiotic bacteria used in human therapy are lactic acid bacteria. In contrast, studies aiming to characterize the mechanisms responsible for the probiotic beneficial effects of Bacillus are rare. The current work seeks to contribute to such characterization by evaluating the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of probiotic B. clausii strains. B. clausii strains release antimicrobial substances in the medium. Moreover, the release of these antimicrobial substances was observed during stationary growth phase and coincided with sporulation. These substances were active against Gram-positive bacteria, in particular against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Clostridium difficile. The antimicrobial activity was resistant to subtilisin, proteinase K, and chymotrypsin treatment, whereas it was sensitive to pronase treatment. The evaluation of the immunomodulatory properties of probiotic B. clausii strains was performed in vitro on Swiss and C57 Bl/6j murine cells. The authors demonstrate that these strains, in their vegetative forms, are able to induce NOS II synthetase activity, IFN-gamma production, and CD4 T-cell proliferation.
TI  - Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI). METHODS: This Phase II, randomized, open-label study was conducted between September 1999 and March 2001 at 14 investigative centers across the United States. Patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg IV q12h for 7 to 14 days. The primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (CE) patients at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients. Also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Tolerability assessments also were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were CE, and 91 were ME. The majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. At the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% CI, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% CI, 60.3%-85.0%). In the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% CI, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% CI, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. Values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/mL for the selected pathogens. Both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cSSSI. In patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway.
AB  - A total of 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), Streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by E-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. Subgroups of oxacillin resistant S. aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MIC5o and MIC9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, MIC range 0.12-2 mg/l). Staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (MIC54, and MIC90 0.25-2 mg/l, MIC range 0.125-2 mg/l). Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 4.0 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50 = 8.0 mg/l, MIC90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. The study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Norway.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci: first results from Turkey.
AB  
TI  - Vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Vancomycin resistance in enterococci, predominantly Enterococcus faecium, developed in the latter half of the 1980s, and the long anticipated development of vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus has now occurred. A number of vancomycin-intermediate strains have been described, and these strains have abnormal, thickened cell walls in the presence of vancomycin. Two mechanisms of resistance have been described in the strains: affinity trapping of vancomycin molecules by cell wall monomers and clogging of the outer layers of peptidoglycan by bound vancomycin molecules, and change in the structure or metabolism of teichoic acids. Of more serious concern has been the description in 2002 of two patients with vancomycin-resistant S aureus infections. In one instance, the patient had skin lesions coinfected with vancomycin resistant, vanA genotype, E faecalis, and the vanA resistance genes could have been transferred to the S aureus strain. Expression of resistance was high in one S aureus strain and low in the other, making detection more challenging in the latter instance. These developments are of great concern, and every effort should be made to prevent further development and spread of vancomycin resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - In vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial-coated vascular grafts.
AB  - The serious medical consequences and costly management of infections associated with vascular grafts have prompted an expanding interest in examining the preventive efficacy of antimicrobial-coated vascular grafts. The purpose of antimicrobial coating of vascular grafts is to reduce bacterial colonization of the device and, hopefully, the occurrence of clinical infection. In this study we demonstrated that expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro, as reflected by zones of inhibition, against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We also showed in a rabbit model that subcutaneously placed minocycline/rifampin-coated vascular grafts have lower rates of staphylococcal device colonization (1/24 = 4% vs. 8/30 = 27%, p = 0.033) and device-related infection (0/24 = 0% vs. 6/30 = 20%, p = 0.028) than uncoated grafts. These promising results encourage the clinical evaluation of vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin.
TI  - [Vancomycin resistant enterococci in the Netherlands].
AB  - Enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) are relatively avirulent enteric bacteria that usually only cause infections in immunocompromised patients. Antimicrobial treatment, however, is hampered as enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. For years, vancomycin was considered the last available antibiotic. Plasmid-mediated resistance against vancomycin among enterococci was first described in the nineteen-eighties and since then incidences of infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have increased dramatically, especially in the United States. In 2000, three outbreaks of VRE occurred in hospitals in the Netherlands and a set of infection-control measures was proposed to limit further transmission. These measures were based on the simultaneous isolation of VRE from multiple patients. All three outbreaks were controlled by these measures and no new outbreaks in Dutch hospitals have been reported since then. Epidemiological studies have shown that hospital outbreaks on three continents were caused by a subpopulation of E. faecium, which is characterized by the presence of a potential virulence gene (variant esp) and resistance to amoxicillin. This 'hospital strain' of E. faecium has probably been prevalent within hospital settings for some time, but only became clinically relevant when it had acquired vancomycin-resistance. Current advice is to implement the set of infection control measures formulated in 2000, only in those patients colonized by amoxicillin-resistant VRE. The potential dangers of VRE were recently underlined by the proven transmission of the vancomycin-resistance gene from VRE to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in two patients in the United States. It is in the interest of the patients that prevalence of VRE and MRSA in Dutch hospitals should be kept as low as possible.
TI  - Influence of protein binding under controlled conditions on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Daptomycin exhibits bactericidal activity against clinically significant Gram-positive bacteria despite being highly bound to human proteins. Evaluations characterizing the effect of protein on daptomycin pharmacodynamics are warranted. METHODS: We utilized an in vitro pharmacodynamic model to simulate daptomycin regimens of 6 mg/kg/day under controlled conditions of pH, calcium and/or protein. Free concentrations were simulated in broth, whereas total concentrations were simulated in broth supplemented with human albumin. Bacterial density was profiled over 48 h for two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) clinical isolates. RESULTS: Daptomycin exhibited bactericidal activity against both MRSA isolates, with time to 99.9% killing occurring at 0.5 h and 8 h in broth and in albumin-supplemented broth, respectively. Initial kill was observed against both VREF isolates followed by regrowth. There was no statistical difference (P>0.05) in extent of bacterial kill at 24 or 48 h between the different media. CONCLUSIONS: Although delayed, the extent of kill for daptomycin was unaltered against all isolates in albumin-supplemented broth. Further antimicrobial studies that incorporate protein are warranted to assess the influence of protein in the pharmacodynamic evaluation of antimicrobials.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the United States in 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. METHODS: From January to December of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA by 268 laboratories. Susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and Enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. In vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (99.8%), E. coli (97.3%), K. pneumoniae (93.3%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). Susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for K. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), E. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), E. faecalis (52.1%), and E. faecium (11.3%). Combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. Susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range, 74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). CONCLUSION: Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.
TI  - Characterization of an inducible vancomycin resistance system in Streptomyces coelicolor reveals a novel gene (vanK) required for drug resistance.
AB  - Vancomycin is the front-line therapy for treating problematic infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and the spread of vancomycin resistance is an acute problem. Vancomycin blocks cross-linking between peptidoglycan intermediates by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala termini of bacterial cell wall precursors, which are the substrate of transglycosylase/transpeptidase. We have characterized a cluster of seven genes (vanSRJKHAX) in Streptomyces coelicolor that confers inducible, high-level vancomycin resistance. vanHAX are orthologous to genes found in vancomycin-resistant enterococci that encode enzymes predicted to reprogramme peptidoglycan biosynthesis such that cell wall precursors terminate in D-Ala-D-Lac rather than D-Ala-D-Ala. vanR and vanS encode a two-component signal transduction system that mediates transcriptional induction of the seven van genes. vanJ and vanK are novel genes that have no counterpart in previously characterized vancomycin resistance clusters from pathogens. VanK is a member of the Fem family of enzymes that add the cross-bridge amino acids to the stem pentapeptide of cell wall precursors, and vanK is essential for vancomycin resistance. The van genes are organized into four transcription units, vanRS, vanJ, vanK and vanHAX, and these transcripts are induced by vancomycin in a vanR-dependent manner. To develop a sensitive bioassay for inducers of the vancomycin resistance system, the promoter of vanJ was fused to a reporter gene conferring resistance to kanamycin. All the inducers identified were glycopeptide antibiotics, but teicoplanin, a membrane-anchored glycopeptide, failed to act as an inducer. Analysis of mutants defective in the vanRS and cseBC cell envelope signal transduction systems revealed significant cross-talk between the two pathways.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland 2001-2002: the BSAC Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in Streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group B isolates (82% resistant). Nine percent of S. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/L), but none required >/=2 mg/L for inhibition. High-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of Enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin MICs (>/=32 mg/L), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. Only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of Enterococcus faecium. Vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of E. faecium, 3% of E. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, MIC of 8 mg/L). Escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of E. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of Klebsiella spp. and 8% of Enterobacter spp. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. Among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in Gram-positive organisms. Ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. MICs of tigecycline were low for Gram-positive species and Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae and Enterobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. An important exception was oxacillin resistance in S. aureus.
TI  - Linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance in vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus prior to clinical use in Turkey.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of recently licensed quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid which have not yet been in clinical use in Turkey against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) strains isolated from various clinical specimens by using the Etest. The results showed that all MRSA strains were fully susceptible to both the new compounds. All strains were inhibited by 1 mg/l quinupristin/dalfopristin (mode MIC 0.38 mg/l) and by 3 mg/l linezolid (mode MIC 1.5 mg/l). Four strains of Enterococcus faecium showed an increase of resistance of 2-3 mg/l to quinupristin/dalfopristin (susceptible mode MIC 0.38 mg/l). With linezolid, all strains except two fell within the range 0.75-2.0 mg/l.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in methanolic extracts of several plant species from northern Argentina.
AB  - Thirty-nine native plant species were collected from the provinces of Chaco and Formosa, in northern Argentina, and were screened for antimicrobial activity. The plants were dried and extracted thoroughly with methanol. The dry extracts, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, were tested for inhibition of microbial growth via microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction dye. The test organisms were: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Inhibition of respiratory activities in some of these microbial species was produced by the extracts of Astronium balansae, Geoffroea decorticans, Peltophorum dubium, Geoffroea spinosa, Lantana balansae, Prosopis kuntzei, Prosopis ruscifolia and Bulnesia sarmientoi, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 0.08 to 0.5 mg dry matter/ml. Further in vitro experiments measuring the growth of S. aureus in liquid culture confirmed that all of the above extracts at 2 x MIC were able to inhibit bacterial growth effectively, and that some of them (A. balansae, G. decorticans, P. dubium, G. spinosa, P. kuntzei and B. sarmientoi) were able to reduce the initial number of viable counts by at least one order of magnitude in 10 hours, indicating that these extracts should be investigated further for the possible presence of bactericidal components.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - Calcium-supplemented daptomycin Etest strips for susceptibility testing on Iso-Sensitest agar.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Iso-Sensitest agar (ISA), which is recommended by the BSAC for routine susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci, contains insufficient calcium for testing daptomycin. Isotonic agar supplemented with 50 mg/L calcium has been advocated, but is not routinely available in many laboratories. We evaluated a daptomycin Etest that incorporates a constant level of calcium throughout the daptomycin gradient, designed to give an appropriate concentration around the strip during testing, as an alternative for susceptibility testing on ISA. METHODS: Ninety-one isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (45 methicillin-susceptible, 46 methicillin-resistant) and 90 enterococci (47 Enterococcus faecalis, 43 Enterococcus faecium) were tested. Daptomycin Etest MICs were determined on ISA, whereas agar dilution MICs were determined in parallel on Isotonic agar supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/L as a control. RESULTS: The agar dilution and Etest MIC ranges of daptomycin for S. aureus were 0.25-1 mg/L (mode 0.5 mg/L), and 0.125-2 mg/L (mode 0.25 mg/L), respectively. The corresponding MIC values for enterococci were 0.25-4 mg/L (mode, 1 mg/L) and 0.125-4 mg/L (mode, 2 mg/L). For staphylococci, 86% of the Etest MIC results were within one dilution of the agar dilution values, and for enterococci, 90% of the Etest MIC results met these criteria. When results from the two methods were not identical, there was a tendency for the Etest MIC values to be lower than the agar dilution values. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that calcium-supplemented daptomycin Etests on ISA are an accurate and convenient alternative to calcium-supplemented Isotonic agar.
TI  - Activity of linezolid against Gram-positive cocci isolated in French hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  - In total, 844 strains of Gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in France between September 1999 and January 2000. MICs of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method A); (ii) by broth microdilution (method B) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by Etest (method E) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method. MIC50 and MIC90 values were identical (2 mg/L) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods A and B. Linezolid was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n = 117), with an MIC90 of 2 mg/L (methods A and B), but with a lower MIC50 of 1 mg/L by method A. Of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. Linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods A and B (MIC50 and MIC90 values of 1-2 mg/L), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. The MIC90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 Enterococcus faecalis and 50 Enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/L by both methods. MICs of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/L (method A) and 0.125-2 mg/L (method E). Pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin G-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/L (MIC90 of 2 mg/L by methods A and E). No strain had an MIC of > 2 mg/L by agar dilution or Etest, or of > 4 mg/L by broth microdilution. Overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of MICs for Gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.
TI  - [Nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first Ciproxan IV special investigation in 2001].
AB  - The parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in September 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. As a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX. This time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to CPFX with those to other antimicrobial drugs. Gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to CPFX than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis to CPFX were comparable to those to cefozopran. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to CPFX did not differ among ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: < 0.25 microgram/ml), ABPC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and ABPC-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) MIC90 of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with CPFX. Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to CPFX similarly to carbapenems and the MIC90 values of CPFX were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to CPFX among the antibacterial drugs examined and the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. CPFX also showed the lowest MIC90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. When extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production and class B beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the Gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing ESBL and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class B beta-lactamase were found. The MIC range of CPFX to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (MIC of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) based on the NCCLS breakpoint. CPFX also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of Japan Society of Chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. Furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. Thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of CPFX was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
TI  - In vitro activities of Daptomycin, Linezolid, and Quinupristin-Dalfopristin against a challenge panel of Staphylococci and Enterococci, including vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - We assessed the in vitro activities of daptomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin (QD) against a contemporary challenge panel of 88 staphylococcal and 90 enterococcal isolates. The staphylococci selected included vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and coagulasenegative staphylococci. Enterococcal isolates included vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) containing either vanA, vanB1, or vanD. The MICs of daptomycin, linezolid, and QD were determined using commercial broth microdilution panels. All three VISA isolates were susceptible to daptomycin, linezolid, and QD. QD was the most active agent against staphylococcal isolates (MIC50 < or = 0.5 microg/ml and MIC90 = 1 microg/ml), including those with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin. QD was also the most active agent against VREF (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microg/ml). No differences were seen for susceptibility of vanA, vanB1, and vanD VREF strains for daptomycin, linezolid, or QD. Daptomycin was the most effective against E. faecalis. On the basis of manufacturer-suggested interpretive criteria, 92% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90 = 4 microg/ml). All isolates tested were susceptible to at least one antimicrobial agent for which interpretive criteria have been defined. Population analysis of three S. aureus isolates for which the daptomycin MICs were 8 microg/ml showed a pattern of homogeneous resistance.
TI  - Harmonization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries.
AB  - A total of 100 bacterial strains (25 Escherichia coli, 25 Salmonella enterica, 25 Staphylococcus aureus, and 25 Enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five Nordic countries using routine methodology. In addition, the 25 Enterococcus strains were identified to species level. A total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. When the reported results were categorized according to the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. For E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella, all laboratories except one had more than 97% concordant results, whereas for Enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. Susceptibility testing of Salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of S. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. Ten laboratories identified the Enterococcus spp. to species level. All five Enterococcus faecium and 10 Enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the Danish Veterinary Institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. This study showed a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility test results of E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella from animals in the Nordic countries are comparable. But it also showed that some aspects can be improved. In addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying E. faecalis and E. faecium.
TI  - High antibiotic susceptibility among bacterial pathogens in Swedish ICUs. Report  from a nation-wide surveillance program using TA90 as a novel index of susceptibility.
AB  - Local infection control measures, antibiotic consumption and patient demographics from 1999-2000 together with bacteriological analyses were investigated in 29 ICUs participating in the ICU-STRAMA programme. The median antibiotic consumption per ICU was 1147 (range 605-2143) daily doses per 1000 occupied bed d (DDD1000). Antibiotics to which > 90% of isolates of an organism were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (TA90). The mean number of TA90 was low (1-2 per organism) for Enterococcus faecium (vancomycin:VAN), coagulase negative staphylococci (VAN), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftazidime:CTZ, netilmicin: NET) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (CTZ, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: TSU), but higher (3-7) for Acinetobacter spp. (imipenem:IMI, NET, TSU), Enterococcus faecalis (ampicillin:AMP, IMI, VAN), Serratia spp. (ciprofloxacin:CIP, IMI, NET), Enterobacter spp. (CIP, IMI, NET, TSU), E. coli (cefuroxime:CXM, cefotaxime/eftazidime:CTX/CTZ, CIP, IMI, NET, piperacillin-tazobactam:PTZ, TSU), Klebsiella spp. (CTX/CTZ CIP, IMI, NET, PTZ, TSU) and Staphylococcus aureus (clindamycin, fusidic acid, NET, oxacillin, rifampicin, VAN). Of S. aureus isolates 2% were MRSA. Facilities for alcohol hand disinfection at each bed were available in 96% of the ICUs. The numbers of TA90 available were apparently higher than in ICUs in southern Europe and the US, despite a relatively high antibiotic consumption. This may be due to a moderate ecological impact of the used agents and the infection control routines in Swedish ICUs.
TI  - Combining quinupristin/dalfopristin with other agents for resistant infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the resistance mechanisms of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus spp. and summarize quinupristin/dalfopristin's (QD's) effects on these resistant organisms when combined with other antibiotics via review of the literature and unpublished data. DATA SOURCES: Data were identified by a PubMed search (1996-May 2003) using the search terms quinupristin/dalfopristin, synergy, in vitro, in vivo, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and individual antibiotic names. Bibliographies of the resultant PubMed searches were reviewed and included if applicable. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All studies reviewed were analyzed; specific drug data were included only if clinically pertinent. In vitro data from studies with adequate design were discussed, whereas all case reports and clinical trials were utilized. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the treatment of VREF, available information seems conflicting, although some clear differences have become apparent. QD-ampicillin and QD-doxycycline combinations have demonstrated beneficial activity, usually displaying synergistic or additive effects even in macrolide-, lincosamine-, and streptogramin-resistant (MLSB) isolates. Vancomycin and chloramphenicol have shown some efficacy, but antagonistic or null results also have been observed. Regarding MRSA, results from many studies of QD combinations have been ambiguous. More common combinations displayed synergy or additive effects against MRSA, but only QD-rifampin showed consistent beneficial activity against MRSA and MLSB isolates. Most other combinations displayed antagonism when tested in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Data supporting the use of various QD-antibiotic combinations against VREF and MRSA are increasing, but further in vitro and in vivo data are needed to confirm the findings.
TI  - Interactions between penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and two novel classes of  PBP inhibitors, arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones.
AB  - Several non-beta-lactam compounds were active against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The MICs of arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones were lower than those of ampicillin and cefotaxime for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MI339 and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium EF12. Several compounds were found to inhibit the cell wall synthesis of S. aureus and the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis catalyzed by ether-treated cells of Escherichia coli or cell wall membrane preparations of Bacillus megaterium. The effects of the arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-one derivatives on E. coli PBP 3 and PBP 5, Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP 2xS (PBP 2x from a penicillin-sensitive strain) and PBP 2xR (PBP 2x from a penicillin-resistant strain), low-affinity PBP 2a of S. aureus, and the Actinomadura sp. strain R39 and Streptomyces sp. strain R61 DD-peptidases were studied. Some of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activities in the 10 to 100 microM concentration range. The inhibition of PBP 2xS by several of them appeared to be noncompetitive. The dissociation constant for the best inhibitor (Ki = 10 microM) was not influenced by the presence of the substrate.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of AC98-6446, a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide  derivative of the natural product mannopeptimycin alpha, and other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - AC98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic cyclic glycopeptide antibiotic related to the  natural product mannopeptimycin alpha (AC98-1). In the present study the activity of AC98-6446 was evaluated against a variety of recent clinical gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains. AC98-6446 demonstrated similar potent activities against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci and glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcal isolates (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml). AC98-6446 also demonstrated good activities against both vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible strains of enterococci (MIC(90)s, 0.12 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively) as well as against streptococcal strains (MIC(90)s, <or= 0.008 to 0.03 microg/ml). AC98-6446 demonstrated bactericidal activity in terms of the reduction in the viable counts (>3 log(10) CFU/ml) of staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates and a marked decrease in the viable counts of most enterococcal strains (from 0.2 to 2.5 log(10) CFU/ml). Unlike vancomycin, which demonstrates time-dependent killing, AC98-6446 demonstrated concentration-dependent killing. The potent activity, novel structure, and bactericidal activity demonstrated by AC98-6446 make it an attractive candidate for further development.
TI  - Role of class A penicillin-binding proteins in PBP5-mediated beta-lactam resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Peptidoglycan polymerization complexes contain multimodular penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) of classes A and B that associate a conserved C-terminal transpeptidase module to an N-terminal glycosyltransferase or morphogenesis module, respectively. In Enterococcus faecalis, class B PBP5 mediates intrinsic resistance to the cephalosporin class of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. To identify the glycosyltransferase partner(s) of PBP5, combinations of deletions were introduced in all three class A PBP genes of E. faecalis JH2-2 (ponA, pbpF, and pbpZ). Among mutants with single or double deletions, only JH2-2 DeltaponA DeltapbpF was susceptible to ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone resistance was restored by heterologous expression of pbpF from Enterococcus faecium but not by mgt encoding the monofunctional glycosyltransferase of Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, PBP5 partners essential for peptidoglycan polymerization in the presence of beta-lactams formed a subset of the class A PBPs of E. faecalis, and heterospecific complementation was observed with an ortholog from E. faecium. Site-directed mutagenesis of pbpF confirmed that the catalytic serine residue of the transpeptidase module was not required for resistance. None of the three class A PBP genes was essential for viability, although deletion of the three genes led to an increase in the generation time and to a decrease in peptidoglycan cross-linking. As the E. faecalis chromosome does not contain any additional glycosyltransferase-related genes, these observations indicate that glycan chain polymerization in the triple mutant is performed by a novel type of glycosyltransferase. The latter enzyme was not inhibited by moenomycin, since deletion of the three class A PBP genes led to high-level resistance to this glycosyltransferase inhibitor.
TI  - Worldwide assessment of dalbavancin activity and spectrum against over 6,000 clinical isolates.
AB  - Continuing emergence of new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and the increased frequency of existing resistances, requires the development of alternative antimicrobial agents. Dalbavancin is an amide glycopeptide derivative with a markedly extended serum elimination half-life. Dalbavancin and selected comparators were tested against 6,339 recent clinical isolates (2002) from the Americas and Europe using reference susceptibility testing methods. The general characteristics of this Gram-positive organism collection were: oxacillin (OXA)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA) at 39% of strains; vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) at 10%; and penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci at 28%. The overall distribution of dalbavancin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from < or = 0.015 to > 32 microg/ml, but > 99% of MIC results were at < or =1 microg/ml. S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were extremely susceptible to dalbavancin (MIC90, 0.06 microg/ml) despite resistance patterns to other agents. Dalbavancin was the most potent compound (by weight) against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (MIC90, 0.06 and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively); however, VRE strains showed decreased dalbavancin susceptibility (MIC50, 4 or 8 microg/ml). All streptococcal isolates were inhibited at < or =0.25 microg/ml of dalbavancin. This reported dalbavancin activity indicates that the new glycopeptide has significant activity, superior to available agents in the class, and a potency that was uniform across geographically sampled organisms. Some VRE were inhibited by very low dalbavancin concentrations (< or = 1 microg/ml; Van B phenotypes). Further clinical development seems warranted for this once-weekly administered agent.
TI  - Increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study in 2001.
AB  - The 5th year KONSAR surveillance in 2001 was based on routine test data at 30 participating hospitals. It was of particular interest to find a trend in the resistances of enterococci to vancomycin, of Enterobacteriaceae to the 3rd generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone, and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacters to carbapenem. Resistance rates of Gram-positive cocci were: 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin; 88% and 16% of Enterococcus faecium to ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively. Seventy-two percent of pneumococci were nonsusceptible to penicillin. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae were: Escherichia coli, 28% to fluoroquinolone; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 27% to ceftazidime, and 20% to cefoxitin; and Enterobacter cloacae, > or =40% to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The resistance rates of P. aeruginosa were 21% to ceftazidime, 17% to imipenem, and those of the acinetobacters were > or =61% to ceftazidime, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolone and cotrimoxazole. Thirty-five percent of non-typhoidal salmonellae were ampicillin resistant, and 66% of Haemophilus influenzae were beta-lactamase producers. Notable changes over the 1997-2001 period were: increases in vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and amikacin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant acinetobacters. With the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria, nationwide surveillance has become more important for optimal patient management, for the control of nosocomial infection, and for the conservation of the newer antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Detection of clinically relevant antibiotic-resistance genes in municipal wastewater using real-time PCR (TaqMan).
AB  - Real-time PCR assays were developed for the quantifiable detection of the antibiotic-resistance genes vanA of enterococci, ampC of Enterobacteriaceae, and mecA of staphylococci in different municipal wastewater samples. Primer and probe designs for these resistance genes were constructed and optimised for application in standardised TaqMan PCR assays. Using reference strains, the linear measurement ranges of the assays were defined and covered concentration ranges of five to seven exponential values. Wastewater isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and beta-lactam-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were cultivated from municipal wastewaters in order to verify the specificity and sensitivity of the primer-probe systems. Additionally, clinical strains of staphylococci resistant to methicillin (MRSA) confirmed the applicability of the mecA-specific detection system. Total DNAs were extracted from five different wastewater treatment plants and used for direct TaqMan PCR detection of the resistance genes without prior cultivation. In municipal wastewater, the resistance gene vanA was detected in 21% of the samples, and ampC in 78%. The gene mecA was not found in municipal wastewater, but in two clinical wastewater samples.
TI  - Low in vitro selection frequencies of enterococcal and staphylococcal mutants resistant to the oxazolidinone AZD2563.
AB  - Mutants with oxazolidinone MICs, 2- to 16-fold higher than those of parents, were selected from two of five clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis during exposure to AZD2563, but only at frequencies of ca. 10(-8). Resistance was not selected in Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Mutants of one E. faecalis isolate had a G2576-->U 23S rRNA mutation; mutants derived from the second E. faecalis isolate lacked this mutation.
TI  - Assessment of the antibacterial activity of selected flavonoids and consideration of discrepancies between previous reports.
AB  - Activity of the flavonoids apigenin, baicalin and galangin against sensitive and  antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococculs aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated. Using an agar dilution assay, galangin was shown to have a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25 to 50 microg/mL against all six strains of S. aureus but negligible activity against the othe species. Apigenin displayed only marginal activity against S. aureus and no activity was detected from baicalin. In inhibition curve studies, galangin caused a 100,000-fold decrease in the viability of a growing population of S. aureus NCTC 6571 within the first two hours of treatment. Decreases in viability of S. aureus NCTC 11561 and NCIMB 9968 populations were also observed.
TI  - A novel antibacterial iridoid and triterpene from Caiophora coronata.
AB  - Bioassay-guided fractionation of the antibacterial CH(2)Cl(2)-MeOH extract obtained from the aerial parts of the Argentinean plant Caiophora coronata led to the isolation of a new triterpene, 1beta,3beta-dihydroxyurs-12-en-27-oic acid, 1, and a new iridoid, 1alpha-methoxy-6alpha,10-dihydroxyisoepiiridomyrmecin (caiophoraenin), 2, along with the known iridoid isoboonein 3. Their structures were established by spectroscopic techniques (1D and 2D NMR, HRFABMS, FTIR). The MIC values of isolated compounds were determined against methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and -resistant (MRSA) strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis (BS), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), Escherichia coli (EC), E. coli imp (ECimp), and Candida albicans (CA). Compound 1 was found active against BS, MSSA, MRSA, VREF, and ECimp with MIC values of 2, 4, 4, 4, and 16 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - In vitro activities of DA-7867, a novel oxazolidinone, against recent clinical isolates of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In vitro activities of DA-7867, a novel oxazolidinone, were compared to those of  linezolid and commonly used antimicrobials. DA-7867 had the lowest MIC for 90% of the aerobic gram-positive bacterial strains tested, </=0.25 micro g/ml, and it was more potent than linezolid.
TI  - In vivo pharmacodynamic activity of daptomycin.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria. We used the neutropenic murine thigh model to characterize the pharmacodynamics of daptomycin. ICR/Swiss mice were rendered neutropenic with cyclophosphamide; and the thigh muscles of the mice were infected with strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium. Animals were treated by subcutaneous injection of daptomycin at doses of 0.20 to 400 mg/kg of body weight/day divided into one, two, four, or eight doses over 24 h. Daptomycin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics, with an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity/dose of 9.4 and a half-life of 0.9 to 1.4 h. The level of protein binding was 90%. Free daptomycin exhibited concentration-dependent killing and produced in vivo postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of 4.8 to 10.8 h. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter was important for efficacy by using free drug concentrations. The peak concentration/MIC (peak/MIC) ratio and 24-h AUC/MIC ratio were the PK and PD parameters that best correlated with in vivo efficacy (R(2) = 83 to 87% for peak/MIC and R(2) = 86% for the AUC/MIC ratio, whereas R(2) = 47 to 50% for the time that the concentration was greater than the MIC) against standard strains of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. The peak/MIC ratios required for a bacteriostatic effect ranged from 12 to 36 for S. pneumoniae, 59 to 94 for S. aureus, and 0.14 to 0.25 for E. faecium. The AUC/MIC ratios needed for a bacteriostatic effect ranged from 75 to 237 for S. pneumoniae, 388 to 537 for S. aureus, and 0.94 to 1.67 for E. faecium. The free daptomycin concentrations needed to average from one to two times the MIC over 24 h to produce a bacteriostatic effect and two to four times the MIC over 24 h to produce greater than 99% killing. The long PAE and potent bactericidal activity make daptomycin an attractive option for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activities of the novel cephalosporin LB 11058 against multidrug-resistant Staphylococci and Streptococci.
AB  - LB 11058 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a C-3 pyrimidinyl-substituted vinyl sulfide group and a C-7 2-amino-5-chloro-1,3-thiazole group. This study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of LB 11058 against 1,245 recent clinical isolates, including a subset of gram-positive strains with specific resistant phenotypes. LB 11058 was very active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The novel cephalosporin was 8- to 16-fold more potent than ceftriaxone, cefepime, or amoxicillin-clavulanate against both penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae. LB 11058 was also very active against both beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC at which 90% of isolates were inhibited [MIC(90)], </=0.008 micro g/ml) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(90), 0.03 to 0.5 micro g/ml), including penicillin-resistant strains. Among oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, LB 11058 MIC results varied from 0.06 to 0.25 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 0.12 micro g/ml), while among oxacillin-resistant strains LB 11058 MICs varied from 0.25 to 1 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml). Coagulase-negative staphylococci showed an LB 11058 susceptibility pattern similar to that of S. aureus, with all isolates being inhibited at </=1 micro g/ml. LB 11058 also showed reasonable in vitro activity against Enterococcus faecalis, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml), and Bacillus spp. (MIC(50), 0.25 micro g/ml); however, it was less active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50), >64 micro g/ml) and Corynebacterium spp. (MIC(50), 32 micro g/ml). Against gram-negative pathogens, LB 11058 showed activity against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.25 micro g/ml), with MICs not influenced by beta-lactamase production. In conclusion, LB 11058 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was highly active against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in Japan].
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 Japanese medical institutions in 2000. A total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. A high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium. Isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI accounted for 30-60%. However, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae family, and Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). About 85% of P. aeruginosa isolated from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among MRSA, Enterococci, and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and P. aeruginosa from RTI as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - Bacteraemia in hospitalised patients with malignant blood disorders: a retrospective study of causative agents and their resistance profiles during a 14-year period without antibacterial prophylaxis.
AB  - Bacteraemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological disorders during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The generally reported trend during the last two decades has been a gradual replacement of Gram-negative bacilli by Gram-positive cocci as the major causes of bacteraemia in neutropenic hosts. However, data that are unaffected by the use of antibacterial prophylaxis are scarce. Our objective therefore was to study the incidence of bacteraemia with different microorganisms in a haematology centre where antibacterial prophylaxis has not been used during the years 1988-2001. A total of 1402 episodes of clinically significant bacteraemia in 927 patients were identified. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and had an underlying haematological disorder, with lymphoma, leukaemia, and myeloma dominating. There were 536 (58%) male, and 391 (42%) female patients, with a median age of 58 years. The dominating pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) 17%, Escherichia coli 16%, alpha-haemolytic streptococci 12%, Staphylococcus aureus 9%, Klebsiella spp 9%, Enterococcus spp 7%, and Pseudomonas spp 5%. The only significant incidence change was an increase of E. faecium bacteraemia. The balance between Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms was essentially stable over the 14-year period. The rates of antibiotic resistance were generally low and stable. Gram-negative bacteria exhibited resistance to fluoroquinolones after 1998. The 7- and 30-day mortality rates were 6.3 and 15.6%, respectively, being significantly higher in patients with bacteraemia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or E. faecium.
TI  - Concentrations in plasma, urinary excretion, and bactericidal activity of linezolid (600 milligrams) versus those of ciprofloxacin (500 milligrams) in healthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose.
AB  - In a randomized crossover study, 12 volunteers (6 males, 6 females) received a single oral dose of 600 mg of linezolid or 500 mg of ciprofloxacin to assess the concentrations in plasma (up to 24 h), urinary excretion (by high-pressure liquid chromatography), and bactericidal titers in urine (UBT) at intervals up to 120 h. The mean maximum concentration of linezolid in plasma was 13.1 mg/liter, and that of ciprofloxacin was 2.46 mg/liter. The median cumulative levels of renal excretion of the administered dose of the parent drug were 44% for linezolid (range, 28 to 47%; mean +/- standard deviation, 40% +/- 7.8%) and 43% for ciprofloxacin (range, 20 to 56%; mean +/- standard deviation, 40% +/- 9.3%). The UBTs, i.e., the highest twofold dilution (with antibiotic-free urine used as the diluent) of urine that was still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and five gram-positive clinical uropathogens for which the MICs of linezolid and ciprofloxacin were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 27278, 2 and 0.25 mg/liter, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible), 1 and 16 mg/liter, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant), 2 and 64 mg/liter, respectively; Staphylococcus saprophyticus (methicillin susceptible), 1 and 0.25 mg/liter, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 1 mg/liter, respectively; and Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 1 mg/liter, respectively. The median UBTs of linezolid measured within the first 6 h were 1:96 for each of the two enterococcal strains and between 1:128 and 1:256 for the four staphylococcal strains. The median UBTs of ciprofloxacin were 1:64 for the two enterococcal strains; between 1:384 and 1:512 for the two ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains; and 1 (bactericidal activity of undiluted urine only) and 1:2 for the two resistant staphylococcal strains, respectively. The areas under the UBT-time curve (AUBT) for linezolid and ciprofloxacin showed no statistically significant (P<0.05) differences except for a better AUBT for linezolid for the two ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococcal strains. For linezolid there were no statistically significant differences in UBTs or AUBTs for ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant strains. Thus, the bactericidal activities of linezolid and ciprofloxacin against susceptible strains in urine were comparable, whereas linezolid also exhibited the same good bactericidal activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. Therefore, linezolid should be tested for use as empirical treatment for complicated urinary tract infections due to gram-positive uropathogens in an appropriate clinical trial.
TI  - Peracetic acid-ethanol treatment of allogeneic avital bone tissue transplants--a  reliable sterilization method.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Based on the European Standard EN 1040, the validation guidelines of  the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices and CPMP guidelines we tested the antimicrobial effectiveness of a peracetic acid-ethanol sterilization procedure (PES) in allogenic avital bone transplants. STUDY DESIGN: Delipidated human bone spongiosa cubes (15 x 15 x 15 mm) served as tissue. Three enveloped viruses (human immunodeficiency virus type 2, pseudorabies virus, bovine virus diarrhoea virus) and three non-enveloped viruses (hepatitis A virus, poliovirus, porcine parvovirus) were used. The reduction of virus infectivity was measured as TCID50/ml in neutralized supernatants and bone homogenates. Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacillus subtilis. Clostridium sporogenes, Mycobacterium terrae. Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger as well as spores of Bacillus subtilis were tested additionally. PES led to a reduction of virus titres by more than 4 log10. Only HAV showed a reduction below 4 log10 (2.87) with residual infectivity. After including a delipidating step for HAV-infected cells, a reduction of over 7 log10 HAV titre was found. For viable bacteria, fungi and spores a titre reduction below the detection level (5 log10) was achieved after an incubation time of 2 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The peracetic acid-ethanol procedure proved to be a reliable method for the sterilization of human bone transplants (layer thickness < or = 15 mm). However, additional safety measures (anamnestic informations, infectious serology, HIV-/HBV-/HCV-PCR in case of multiorgan donors) should be taken.
TI  - Validation of the 'Marburg bone bank system' for thermodisinfection of allogenic  femoral head transplants using selected bacteria, fungi, and spores.
AB  - The Marburg Bone Bank System 'Lobator sd-2' is widely used to process human femoral heads removed during aseptic surgery by thermal disinfection. The inactivating capacity of the thermodisinfection system was validated in compliance with current standards using a newly developed femoral head model. The following micro-organisms, bacteria and fungi, taken from the American Type Culture Collection were investigated: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphyloccus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis including spores, Clostridium sporogenes, Mycobacterium terrae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger spores. Highly enriched suspensions of these micro-organisms were applied to the centre of the femoral heads. The reduction in the number of micro-organisms was determined by counting the colony-forming units (cfu) before and after processing the spiked test device in the 'Lobator sd-2' system. Vegetative bacteria, fungi and fungal spores were completely inactivated (reduction factor >/=6 log(10)). The numbers of B. subtilis and C. sporogenes spores, both known to be heat-resistant, were reduced by one to two orders of magnitude. These bacteria serve as a model for spore forming pathogens which are not relevant in femoral heads from living donors. By processing human femoral heads from living donors by thermal disinfection using the Marburg Bone Banking system, a high level of safety is achieved regarding clinically relevant pathogens. To further increase the safety of the thermally treated femoral heads, we recommend that the medical history and present state of the donor, as well as the necessary serological tests should be taken into account.
TI  - Array synthesis of novel lipodepsipeptide.
AB  - Synthetic array technology was utilized to rapidly synthesize and analyze a diverse set of reductive alkylation analogues of daptomycin. Analysis of the array suggested the use of polar functionality such as sulfonamides or amide or polar spaces such as piperazine would beneficially affect activity.
TI  - Novel oxazolidinone-quinolone hybrid antimicrobials.
AB  - Antimicrobial compounds incorporating oxazolidinone and quinolone pharmacophore substructures have been synthesized and evaluated. Representative analogues 2, 5, and 6 display an improved potency versus linezolid against gram-positive and fastidious gram-negative pathogens. The compounds are also active against linezolid- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium strains. The MOA for these new antimicrobials is consistent with a combination of protein synthesis and gyrase A/topoisomerase IV inhibition, with a structure-dependent degree of the contribution from each inhibitory mechanism.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and synergy studies of BAL9141, a novel pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem, tested against streptococci, enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - BAL9141 has been reported to have inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), many enterococci, and streptococci with various resistant patterns. BAL9141 potency was assessed by time-kill curves alone or with subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (MIC/4). BAL9141 exhibited bactericidal activity alone against all the streptococci and staphylococci. Among ampicillin-susceptible enterococci, BAL9141 was bactericidal against some strains, but no BAL9141 inhibition was observed of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The activity of BAL9141 with gentamicin was slightly enhanced (not synergy) or indifferent against staphylococci. BAL9141 demonstrated bactericidal action alone against Enterococcus faecalis and some E. faecium strains (-4.8 to -6.0 log10 CFU/mL), but static effects were also noted. Drug interactions with gentamicin showed early synergy (4-8 h) for all enterococci, and indifference or synergy at 24 h (no antagonism). BAL9141 (< or = 8 mg/L) showed promising bactericidal activity alone and synergy with gentamicin against some of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci tested.
TI  - In vitro studies of the pharmacodynamics of teicoplanin against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the basic pharmacodynamic properties of teicoplanin in  vitro for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium. METHODS: The following experiments were performed: (1) bacterial killing by teicoplanin at different concentrations; (2) bacterial killing by teicoplanin at 8 x MIC against the same strains with inocula of 5 x 10(3), 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(7) CFU/mL; (3) studies of the postantibiotic effect (PAE) and the postantibiotic sub-MIC effect (PASME) of teicoplanin; (4) studies of the killing by teicoplanin in an in vitro kinetic model following exposure to simulated human serum pharmacokinetic concentrations (6 mg/kg OD at steady state). RESULTS: Concentration-dependent killing was noted against S. epidermidis, with a > 4 log10 difference in CFUs between 2 x MIC and 64 x MIC at 24 h. Also, against S. aureus there was slight concentration-dependent killing, which, however, did not reach 2 log10 CFU/mL. Teicoplanin exerted a similar killing rate at all inocula for S. epidermidis, except for slower initial killing up to 6 h at the highest inoculum. In contrast, overall slower killing at all inocula was seen for S. aureus, where an inoculum effect was noted at the highest inoculum. For E. faecium, only a bacteriostatic effect was noted at all concentrations and inocula. No or very short PAEs were noted for the investigated strains. However, when the strains in the postantibiotic phase were exposed to 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 x MIC of teicoplanin (PASME), substantial prolongation of the PAEs was seen. Although no significant killing was achieved in our kinetic model for any of the strains, regrowth of S. epidermidis was noted first after 8 h, despite a T > MIC24 of only 5% (1.2 h), illustrating the long post-MIC effect for this strain. For S. aureus, T > MIC was 38%, and regrowth occurred later than for S. epidermidis. Neither killing nor regrowth was seen for E. faecium with a T > MIC24 of 27%. CONCLUSION: Teicoplanin exerted a concentration-dependent bactericidal effect against S. epidermidis, a less notable one against S. aureus, and a bacteriostatic effect against E. faecium. A reduced killing rate with increasing inocula was seen for S. aureus and also for S. epidermidis at the highest inoculum. No or very short PAEs were noted for the investigated strains, but were substantially prolonged with the addition of subinhibitory concentrations. When human pharmacokinetics was simulated (6 mg/kg OD at steady state) in the kinetic model, no net bactericidal effect was noted for any of the strains at 24 h.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Leontopodium alpinum (Edelweiss).
AB  - Extracts and individual constituents of Leontopodium alpinum Cass. (Asteraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activity in two different assays. Extracts were screened in agar diffusion assays, whereas the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of single compounds were determined by the microbroth dilution method according to NCCLS criteria. Significant antimicrobial activities were found against various strains of Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes strains. These results support the ethnomedicinal use of Leontopodium alpinum for the treatment of respiratory and abdominal disorders.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of linezolid and five other antimicrobials against  nosocomial isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The activity of linezolid in comparison to vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, clindamycin and gentamicin was tested against 60 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 60 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from patients with nosocomial infections and 24 strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolated from feces of hospitalized patients. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All tested strains were sensitive to linezolid and specifically all methicillin-resistant S. aureus had MIC range 0.25-3.00, MIC50 = 0.75, MIC90 = 1.5, all methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis had MIC range 0.125-1.5, MIC50 = 0.5, MIC90 = 1 and all vancomycin-resistant E. faecium had MIC range 0.5-1.5, MIC50 = 1, MIC90 = 1. Linezolid is the first of a novel antimicrobial class, the oxazolidinones, which is a promising treatment for serious Gram-positive infections, including multiresistant strains.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - Daptomycin against multiple drug-resistant staphylococcus and enterococcus isolates in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic that exhibits bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. In pursuit of potential clinical dosing regimens for endocarditis, we evaluated two, once-daily daptomycin regimens against multiple, drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin susceptibility was determined in the absence and presence of physiologic concentrations of albumin. An in vitro pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations incorporating protein was used to simulate regimens of daptomycin at 6 and 8 mg/kg/day and vancomycin at 1 g every 12 h against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA-67 and 494) and S. epidermidis (MRSE-R227 and R617), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus and S. epidermidis (GISA-992 and GISE-12333), and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF-SF12047 and 12366). Bacterial quantification occurred over 72 h. Daptomycin MIC results for study isolates in the absence or presence of albumin ranged from 0.125 to 4 and 1 to 8, respectively. Both daptomycin regimens achieved greater than 99.9% kill by 8 h and demonstrated greater bacterial reduction than vancomycin against all tested isolates at 24, 48, and 72 h (p < 0.05). Undetectable limits of bacterial quantification was achieved and maintained by 8 mg/kg/day against MRSA-494 and 67, GISA-992, and VREF-590 for the study duration. Although slight regrowth was noted only for 6 mg/kg/day against MRSA-67, 99.9% kill was maintained throughout the study period without development of resistance. Pharmacodynamic profiles and drug exposure of daptomycin at 6 mg/kg/day corresponds to previously reported AUC/MIC requirements. These results suggest that 6 and 8 mg/kg/day of daptomycin represent potential regimens for further clinical evaluation in drug-resistant Gram-positive endocarditis.
TI  - Piperacillin-tazobactam versus ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin in the treatment of infective episodes after liver transplantation.
AB  - An optimum antimicrobial regimen for bacterial infection after orthotopic liver transplantation has not been identified. In this prospective 4 year study of patients undergoing liver transplantation, patients were randomized to receive either piperacillin-tazobactam (112 patient episodes) or ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin (105 patient episodes) for empirical treatment of infective episodes in the first 3 months after transplant. Metronidazole was added to the ciprofloxacin-amoxicillin regimen where anaerobic infection was suspected. Patient groups were comparable with respect to clinical, biochemical and haematological parameters. At the 72 h primary efficacy end-point, the overall response rate for the intention-to-treat group was 74/112 (66.1%) for piperacillin-tazobactam and 63/105 (60.0%) for ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin (P=0.399); the corresponding figures for the per-protocol (PP) group were 73/82 (89.0%) (piperacillin-tazobactam) and 61/80 (76.3%) (ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin) (P=0.038). At the end-of-study assessment, 58.9% of episodes in the piperacillin-tazobactam group had a successful clinical outcome, compared with 50.5% in the ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin group (P=0.222); the corresponding figures for the PP group were 83.5% (piperacillin-tazobactam) and 68.8% (ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin) (P=0.038). Staphylococci and aerobic Gram-negative bacilli were the predominant pathogens in both groups. Bacteria resistant to the study drugs were encountered, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and multiply-resistant Klebsiella spp. Empirical monotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is an effective treatment for infective episodes in liver transplant patients.
TI  - The screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (pH 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees C under aeration. Among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm H2O2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm H2O2 in the cell suspensions. Among the 9 high-level H2O2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The cell-free filtrate from Lc. lactis subsp. lactis AI 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm H2O2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria ivanovii, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Aeromonas hydrophila. After 1 h incubation at 30 degrees C in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/mL) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. The sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and pH. The enterococci were resistant to the treatment. Our results show that H2O2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - The effect of cyclosporine and tacrolimus on indigenous bacterial flora in human  skin grafts.
AB  - Allogeneic skin transplants require intensive immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment protocols used for parenchymal organ grafts are not satisfactory to prevent skin graft rejection. Another factor responsible for the destruction of allogeneic skin transplants is bacterial inflammation. Temporary ischemia and the allogeneic reaction in transplanted skin cause increased permeability of the epidermis and the dermal capillaries, making skin grafts vulnerable to bacterial penetration. Moreover, immunosuppressive therapy compromises the host immune response. The present study assessed the effects of immunosuppression by cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) on the indigenous bacterial flora of transplanted human skin. We found that a 6-day course of treatment with CsA or Tac was followed by an increased prevalence of bacterial isolates, mostly evidenced by a change in the spectrum of graft bacterial flora from Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci toward more pathogenic strains such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, micrococcus, and pseudomonas. The mouse skin adjacent to the graft remained sterile, precluding the possibility of graft contamination with mouse flora.
TI  - Efficacy of some neutralizers in suspension tests determining the activity of disinfectants.
AB  - The ability of six mixtures to neutralize glutaraldehyde, o-phthalaldehyde and peracetic acid was tested using four reference strains: Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP A22, Escherichia coli CIP 54127, Staphylococcus aureus CIP 53154, and Enterococcus faecium CIP 5855. Glutaraldehyde was the hardest to neutralize, and peracetic acid the easiest. The most effective mixture was Tween 80 with sodium bisulphate, sodium thioglycolate, lecithin and cysteine, and the least effective was Tween 80, lecithin and histidine. The efficacy of the neutralizers may indicate a propensity loss of activity from interfering substances when disinfectants are used in practice.
TI  - A standardized test to assess the impact of different organic challenges on the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics.
AB  - This paper presents a suggestion for determining the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics in a phase 2/step 1 assay. Emphasis is placed on specific organic challenges to evaluate the efficacy of antiseptics used to rinse the oral cavity, mucous membranes, or wounds for either prophylactic or therapeutic reasons. Basic data are given concerning ready-to-use products based on Poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone-)iodine-complex (PVP-iodine), chlorhexidine, octenidine, or cetylpyridinium chloride. Hydrogen peroxide (3.0%) was included to assess a product with known limited efficacy only. Using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and Candida albicans, a 10(5)-fold reduction can be achieved in 10 min without interfering substances. In the presence of 10% albumin, 10% sheep blood, or 1% mucin, a 10(3)-fold reduction is yielded using products based on PVP-iodine, octenidine, or chlorhexidine. The combination of 4.5% albumin, 4.5% sheep blood, and 1% mucin was the most difficult organic challenge and only the products based on PVP-iodine, octenidine, or chlorhexidine remained active. The cetylpyridinium-based product and hydrogen peroxide were less effective. Based on these data, a proposal for a phase 2/step 1 assay for antiseptics is presented to promote the standardization efforts.
TI  - Controlling antibiotic resistance in the ICU: different bacteria, different strategies.
AB  - To reduce antimicrobial resistance in the intensive care unit, hospitals are developing strategies such as improving infection control, adhering to prescribed formularies, requiring prior approval for using certain antibiotics, setting limits on the duration of antimicrobial therapy, and rotating the use of antimicrobial drugs on a regular schedule. Each strategy has theoretical benefits and limitations, but good data on their efficacy in controlling antimicrobial resistance are limited.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive organisms in the intensive care unit.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The epidemiology of gram-positive pathogens in the intensive care unit are reviewed, recent trends in antimicrobial resistance among these organisms are discussed, and the significance of these data with respect to treatment are considered. RECENT FINDINGS: Results of surveillance studies published in 2001 and 2002 have demonstrated that gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci are among the most common bacteria infecting patients in intensive care units. Furthermore, these organisms are becoming increasingly resistant to available antimicrobial agents, and 2002 has ushered in worrisome developments such as the appearance of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and the rise in incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci are other problems of great concern. Novel antibiotics such as quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid have activity against these agents, but resistance may develop to these agents as well. Studies have shown that infections caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms may be associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. Exposure to antibiotics is a major risk factor for producing antibiotic resistance in patients, and methods to limit the spread of these organisms include restriction of antibiotic use, infection control, surveillance programs, and isolation procedures. SUMMARY: An awareness of the prevalence and patterns of resistance among gram-positive nosocomial pathogens is vital for the appropriate treatment of hospitalized patients. In addition, efforts must be made to minimize the selection and spread of these organisms.
TI  - Prepared endotracheal tubes: are they a potential source for pathogenic microorganisms?
AB  - Prepared endotracheal tubes (PETTs) are frequently used for unanticipated difficult intubation, but their storage time is highly variable and institution-dependent. We sought to determine first, if open, unused PETTs are a potential source of pathogenic microorganisms, and second, if PETTs can provide a medium for bacterial survival after deliberate contamination. A stylet was inserted into a 7-mm ETT, and this system was ethylene oxide sterilized. The PETTs were placed in 20 different locations and sampled 8 times in a 4-wk period. Growth was determined after 48-h incubation, and the microorganism was identified. In Phase 2, the PETT (n = 40) was swabbed with a fresh suspension of H. influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, or a negative control. Nonvirulent bacteria were cultured from 13 of 160 (8.1%) samples and from 15 of 320 (4.7%) samples in Phases 1 and 2, respectively. No PETT grew the same bacteria more than once. In Phase 2, after 24 h, only E. faecium was recovered. Based on this study, the pathogenic potential of PETTs is very small, and they can be safely used for up to 1 mo. This practice could translate to significant cost reduction for operating room budgets. IMPLICATIONS: Prepared endotracheal tubes (PETTs) are back-up airway equipment to be used in the case of a difficult intubation. A short PETT shelf life because of unknown safe storage time results in significant budget costs. This blinded, controlled study examined the pathogenic potential of PETTs in the operating room environment.
TI  - Coexistence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus in the  intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients.
AB  - The potential for transfer of vancomycin-resistance genes from enterococci to Staphylococcus aureus exists when these organisms share an ecologic niche. We performed an 8-month prospective study to determine the frequency at which S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) coexist in the intestinal tracts of VRE-colonized patients and evaluated whether antianaerobic antibiotic therapy promoted increased density of S. aureus colonization. Of 37 patients colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, 23 (62%) had S. aureus recovered from stool specimens and 20 (87%) had methicillin-resistant strains. There was no significant difference in the mean density (+/- standard deviation) of S. aureus during versus > or =1 month after discontinuation of antianaerobic antibiotic therapy (5.1+/-1.5 vs. 4.7+/-1.6 log10 colony-forming units per gram of stool; P=.34). No S. aureus isolates were resistant to vancomycin. S. aureus and VRE often coexist in the intestinal tract, providing a potential reservoir for the emergence of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus isolates.
TI  - Role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of Gram-positive nosocomial infections in haematological or oncological patients.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens, primarily Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, are now the predominant causes of infection in neutropenic haematology/oncology patients, but are often resistant to multiple antibiotics. Glycopeptides have been the only alternative antibiotic treatments for multidrug-resistant Gram-positive infections to date. However, glycopeptides are not always effective or well tolerated, and can produce nephrotoxic or ototoxic effects. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a recently introduced streptogramin antibiotic that is active in vitro against most of the major Gram-positive pathogens causing infection in neutropenic patients. Recent studies of the in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates of Gram-positive pathogens to quinupristin/dalfopristin are summarized. Pre-clinical and clinical studies of the efficacy and safety of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of Gram-positive infections are reviewed. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is active in vitro against the vast majority of recent isolates of relevant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, but excluding Enterococcus faecalis. Pre-clinical and clinical data indicate the efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin in infections caused by these organisms, including bacteraemia and catheter-related infections. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is not associated with nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a potential alternative to glycopeptides in haematology or oncology patients with multidrug-resistant Gram-positive infections, especially those who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, glycopeptides.
TI  - Angiotensin I-converting-enzyme-inhibitory and antibacterial peptides from Lactobacillus helveticus PR4 proteinase-hydrolyzed caseins of milk from six species.
AB  - Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(S1)-casein (alpha(S1)-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-CN f58-76; ovine alpha(S1)-CN f1-6 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-CN f58-65 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-187; buffalo beta-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 micro g/ml (100 micro mol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 micro g/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC(50)s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to beta-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 micro g/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.
TI  - Discovery of a small molecule that inhibits cell division by blocking FtsZ, a novel therapeutic target of antibiotics.
AB  - The emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major health problem and, therefore, it is critical to develop new antibiotics with novel modes of action. FtsZ, a tubulin-like GTPase, plays an essential role in bacterial cell division, and its homologs are present in almost all eubacteria and archaea. During cell division, FtsZ forms polymers in the presence of GTP that recruit other division proteins to make the cell division apparatus. Therefore, inhibition of FtsZ polymerization will prevent cells from dividing, leading to cell death. Using a fluorescent FtsZ polymerization assay, the screening of >100,000 extracts of microbial fermentation broths and plants followed by fractionation led to the identification of viriditoxin, which blocked FtsZ polymerization with an IC50 of 8.2 microg/ml and concomitant GTPase inhibition with an IC50 of 7.0 microg/ml. That the mode of antibacterial action of viriditoxin is via inhibition of FtsZ was confirmed by the observation of its effects on cell morphology, macromolecular synthesis, DNA-damage response, and increased minimum inhibitory concentration as a result of an increase in the expression of the FtsZ protein. Viriditoxin exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, without affecting the viability of eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Many chemokines including CCL20/MIP-3alpha display antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that beta-defensins exhibit chemotactic activity by sharing the chemokine receptor CCR6 with the CC chemokine ligand CCL20/macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP-3alpha). Structural analysis of CCL20/MIP-3alpha revealed that most of the positively charged residues are concentrated at one area of its topological surface, a characteristic considered to be important for the antimicrobial activity of defensins. Here, we report that similar to defensins, CCL20/MIP-3alpha has antimicrobial effects on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Additionally, by screening a total of 30 human chemokines, we have identified an additional 17 human chemokines, which exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro. Collectively, about two-thirds of the chemokines investigated so far has the capacity to kill microorganisms in vitro, suggesting that antimicrobial activity may be another host-defense function for certain chemokines. Comparison of the structural characteristics between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial chemokines suggests that topological formation of a large, positively charged electrostatic patch on the surface of the molecule is likely to be a common structural feature of antimicrobial chemokines.
TI  - Antimicrobial characterization of human beta-defensin 3 derivatives.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 3 (hBD3) is a highly basic 45-amino-acid protein that acts both as an antimicrobial agent and as a chemoattractant molecule. Although the nature of its antimicrobial activity is largely electrostatic, the importance of the molecular structure on this activity is poorly understood. Two isoforms of hBD3 were synthesized: the first with native disulfide linkages and the second with nonnative linkages. In a third synthetic peptide, all cysteine residues were replaced with alpha-aminobutyric acid, creating a completely linear peptide. A series of six small, linear peptides corresponding to regions of hBD3 with net charges ranging from +4 to +8 (at pH 7) and lengths ranging from 9 to 20 amino acids were also synthesized. The linear full-length peptide showed the highest microbicidal activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, while all three full-length forms showed equal activity against Candida albicans. The linear peptide also showed high activity against Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Peptides corresponding to the C terminus showed higher activities when tested against E. coli, with the most active peptides being the most basic. However, only the peptide corresponding to the N terminus of hBD3 showed any activity against S. aureus and C. albicans. Further, N-terminal deletion mutants of native hBD3 showed diminished activities against S. aureus. Thus, the antimicrobial properties of hBD3 derivatives are determined by both charge and structure.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against Enterococcus species and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a murine thigh infection model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococci species based on bacterial density in an immunocompromised mouse thigh infection model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of daptomycin was determined against two MRSA, one vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and one vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis using the immunocompromised murine thigh model. Efficacy was assessed by the change in log10 cfu in thighs after 24 h of drug treatment. RESULTS: Daptomycin produced a maximal kill of 4.5-5 log10 cfu against the MRSA and 1.5-2 log10 for the Enterococcus species. AUC/MIC was the most predictive of the PD parameters. Utilizing MICs determined in serum or broth in the calculation of the PD parameters had minimal effect on this correlation. AUCfree/MICbroth required for static effects with MRSA and Enterococcus species were 12-36 and 5-13, whereas 99% of maximal kill was achieved at ratios of 171-442 and 38-157, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal the potent in vivo bactericidal activity of daptomycin against MRSA and Enterococcus species using clinically achievable drug exposures (dose 4-6 mg/kg per day) currently under investigation in man.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in pediatric patients in United States hospitals: epidemiology, clinical features and susceptibilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We identified the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of nosocomial bloodstream isolates in pediatric patients in the US Prospective surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals during a 6-year period [Surveillance and Control of Pathogens of Epidemiologic Importance (SCOPE)] detected 22 609 bloodstream infections, of which 3432 occurred in patients < or =16 years of age. RESULTS: Gram-positive organisms accounted for 65% of cases, Gram-negative organisms accounted for 24% of cases and 11% were caused by fungi. The overall crude mortality was 14% (475 of 3432) but notably higher for infections caused by Candida spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 20 and 29%, respectively. The most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (43%), enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida spp. (each, 9%). The mean interval between admission and infection averaged 21 days for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 25 days for S. aureus and Candida spp., 32 days for Klebsiella spp. and 34 days for Enterococcus spp. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased from 10% in 1995 to 29% in 2001. Vancomycin-resistance was seen in 1% of Enterococcus faecalis and in 11% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial BSI occurred predominantly in very young and/or critically ill children. Gram-positive pathogens predominated across all ages, and increasing antimicrobial resistance was observed in pediatric patients.
TI  - Disinfection of surfaces by photocatalytic oxidation with titanium dioxide and UVA light.
AB  - Particularly in microbiological laboratories and areas in intensive medical use,  regular and thorough disinfection of surfaces is required in order to reduce the numbers of bacteria and to prevent bacterial transmission. The conventional methods of disinfection with wiping are not effective in the longer term, cannot be standardized, are time- and staff-intensive and use aggressive chemicals. Disinfection with hard ultraviolet C (UVC) light is usually not satisfactory, as the depth of penetration is inadequate and there are occupational medicine risks. Photocatalytic oxidation on surfaces coated with titanium dioxide (TiO2) might offer a possible alternative. In the presence of water and oxygen, highly reactive OH-radicals are generated by TiO2 and mild ultraviolet A (UVA). These radicals are able to destroy bacteria, and may therefore be effective in reducing bacterial contamination. Direct irradiation with UVC however can produce areas of shadow in which bacteria are not inactivated. Using targeted light guidance and a light-guiding sheet (out of a UVA-transmittant, Plexiglas, for example), as in the method described in the present study, bacterial inactivation over the entire area is possible. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated using bacteria relevant to hygiene such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. For these bacteria, a reduction efficiency (RE) more than 6log10 steps in 60 min was observed. Using Candida albicans, a RE of 2log10 steps in 60 min was seen. Light and scanning electron microscopic examinations suggest that the germ destruction achieved takes place through direct damage to cell walls caused by OH-radicals.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Identification of harman as the antibiotic compound produced by a tunicate-associated bacterium.
AB  - The alkaloid harman, previously reported from some marine invertebrates, was identified as the antibiotic substance of the tunicate-associated bacterium Enterococcus faecium. It exhibited antibacterial activity (MIC, 0.017 mM) against the ichthyopathogenic strain Vibrio anguillarum.
TI  - A comparison of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram-positive cocci isolated from community-private and university-affiliated hospitals from Puerto Rico.
AB  - The antimicrobial resistance patterns of 2,462 selected Gram-positive cocci obtained from three Community-Private Hospitals (CPH) and three University-Affiliated Hospitals (UAH) were evaluated utilizing the institutions' antimicrobial susceptibility reports for the year 2000. The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the in vitro resistance to selected standard antibiotics of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates, and 2) to compare the antimicrobial resistance patterns between community-private (CPH) and university-affiliated hospitals (UAH). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolated organism in CPH (63.3%) followed by E. faecalis (31.0%). In UAH, the most prevalent cocci were E. faecalis (51.7%) followed by S. aureus (43.9%). Enterococcus faecium represented 2.3% and 4.4% of CPH and UAH isolates, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae represented 3.4% of the total Gram-positive isolates from CPH, no S. pneumoniae was reported in UAH. The antimicrobial susceptibility results showed that for Staphylococcus aureus there was a statistically significant higher resistance to methicillin and thrimethoprim sulfamethoxazole in UAH, while resistance to erythromycin was significantly higher in CPH. There was no difference in the resistance of S. aureus to other antimicrobial agents between hospitals groups. A statistically significant resistant to vancomycin was found between enterococcal isolates from UAH (43%) and CPH (12.7%). High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) was observed among UAH enterococcal isolates with E. faecium showing a higher resistance than E. faecalis, no data for HLAR in CPH could be obtained. For pneumococci 46% of CPH isolates were resistant to penicillin. In summary, there are important differences in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance between the Gram-positive bacteria isolated from community and teaching hospitals.
TI  - Antiviral activity of N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of Lactarius sesquiterpenoid alcohols in vitro.
AB  - Cytotoxic, antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties of a new, originally synthesised group of compounds: the N-benzoylphenylisoserinates of sesquiterpenoid alcohols - derivatives of taxol and various sesquiterpenes of Lactarius origin were evaluated in vitro. Among 16 compounds tested, 6 decreased HSV-1 titres. Selectivity indices ranged from 13.9 to 31.7. No activity against RNA viruses (parainfluenza 3, Coxsackie B3, vesicular stomatitis virus, and encephalomyocarditis virus), bacteria: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis and fungal strain of Candida albicans was detected.
TI  - Characteristics and identification of enterocins produced by Enterococcus faecium JCM 5804T.
AB  - AIMS: To screen bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in 52 type and reference strains, which have not previously been studied, with respect to bacteriocins, and to characterize the presence of bacteriocins. METHODS AND RESULTS: Only Enterococcus faecium JCM 5804T showed bacteriocin-like activity. It inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus spp., Enterococcus spp., Clostridium spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE). However, it was not effective against Gram-negative strains, Weisella spp., Leuconostoc spp., Lactococcus spp., or methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The inhibitory activity of Ent. faecium JCM 5804T was inactivated by proteinase K, trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and papain, but not by lysozyme, lipase, catalase, or beta-glucosidase. The inhibitory activity was stable at 100 degrees C for 30 min, and had a pH range from 2 to 10. The molecular weight of the partially purified bacteriocin(s) was approx. 4.5 kDa, according to tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing methods identified three different types of bacteriocins produced by Ent. faecium JCM 5804T, enterocin A, enterocin B, and enterocin P-like bacteriocin. CONCLUSION: Enterococcus faecium JCM 5804T produced three different types of bacteriocins, and they inhibited LAB and pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This is the first report of enterocin A, enterocin B, and enterocin P-like bacteriocin, detected in Ent. faecium JCM 5804T among LAB type and reference strains.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria from ICU patients in UK hospitals to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microbiologists in 25 sentinel laboratories were each asked to refer up to 100 clinically-significant Gram-positive bacteria isolated from consecutive intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A total of 1595 isolates were collected from patients in 23 hospitals; these included Staphylococcus aureus (47.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (30.6%), enterococci (14.3%), pneumococci (2.8%) and other streptococci (3.5%). A few coryneforms, other bacilli and a Nocardia sp. were also collected. Rates of oxacillin resistance among S. aureus and CNS isolates were 59.3 and 78.5%, respectively. Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus were not detected, although two isolates (0.3%) were resistant to teicoplanin [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 8 mg/L]. In contrast, 13.7% of CNS were teicoplanin resistant (MICs 8-32 mg/L) and 1.2% were resistant to vancomycin. Among the enterococci, 72.5% were Enterococcus faecalis and 24.5% were Enterococcus faecium, the remainder including isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus or Enterococcus gallinarum. Eighteen percent of E. faecium isolates were vancomycin-resistant, compared with only 3% of E. faecalis isolates. Rates of high-level gentamicin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium were 40 and 25%, respectively. Nine percent of pneumococci and streptococci were resistant to penicillin, with 7 and 11%, respectively, resistant to erythromycin. None of the isolates showed resistance to linezolid, with the MICs for the entire study population falling in the range of 0.5-4 mg/L.
TI  - Optimization of computer software settings improves accuracy of pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis macrorestriction fragment pattern analysis.
AB  - Computer-assisted analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) libraries can facilitate comparisons of fragment patterns present on multiple gels. We evaluated the ability of the Advanced Analysis (version 4.01) and Database (version 1.12) modules of the Phoretix gel analysis software package (Nonlinear USA, Inc., Durham, N.C.) to accurately match DNA fragment patterns. Two gels containing 38 lanes of SmaI-digested Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF DNA were analyzed to assess the impact of (i) varying the lane position of the standards, (ii) using gel plugs made at different times, and (iii) normalizing the fragment patterns by using molecular weight (MW) algorithms versus retardation factor (R(f)) algorithms. Two sets of PFGE libraries (one containing SmaI restriction patterns from 62 Enterococcus faecium isolates and the other containing SmaI restriction patterns of 89 Staphylococcus aureus isolates) were analyzed to assess the impact of varying the matching tolerance algorithm (designated as the vector box setting [VBS]) in the Phoretix software. Varying the lane position of standards on a gel and using gel plugs made on different days resulted in different VBSs, although it was not possible to judge whether those differences were statistically significant. Normalization of E. faecalis OG1RF fragment patterns by R(f) and MW methodology yielded no statistically significant differences in variability between the same fragment on different lanes. Suboptimal VBSs decreased the specificity with which related isolates were grouped together in dendrograms. The optimal VBS for analysis of PFGE fragment patterns from E. faecalis isolates differed from that for S. aureus isolates and sometimes was not that recommended by the manufacturer. Thus, computer-assisted analysis of PFGE patterns seemed to compensate for the intra- and intergel variation evaluated in the present study, and optimizing the software for the species to be tested was a critical preliminary step before further PFGE library analysis.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. We assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in UK and Ireland. Standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. For quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for MIC tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. Compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. These changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of S. aureus-reflected the massive increase of MRSA, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. Based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of P. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of Enterococcus faecalis. Resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in E. coli from 4 to 10%, Klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in AmpC-inducible Enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in P. mirabilis or P. aeruginosa. MIC tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in Enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the E. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. This situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. Thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that MIC be determined with, e.g., an Etest.
TI  - [Surveillance on gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections or community acquired infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug-resistance rates of gram-positive cocci isolated from patients with hospital acquired infection (HAI) or community acquired infection (CAI) in 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: According to the previous protocol, from July 1(st) 2000 to June 30(th) 2001, a total of 2401 pathogenic strains were isolated from 13 hospitals. Among them, 805 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected for in vitro susceptibility test using international standard plate dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected to represent the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of the bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: The detectable rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 37.4% (89/238) and 33.8% (51/151) respectively. Among a total of 238 strains of S. aureus, 139 were isolated from patients with CAI and 37 were from HAI patients, the rate of MRSA from HAI patients (89.2%, 33/37) was significantly higher than that of MRSA from CAI patients (30.2%, 42/139) (P < 0.01). The total resistant rate of penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was 26.7% (8/30), including a R% of 3.3% (1/30) and an I% of 23.3% (7/30). 331 strains of Enterococcus were isolated, including 178 strains from the study wards and 153 strains from other wards. The ratio of number of strains of E. faecalis to E. faecium was 6.8:1 (286/42). The rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecium (AREF) was 73.8% (31/42), significantly higher than the rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecalis (16.4%, 47/286). Neither strains of S. aureus nor strains of coagulase negative Staphylococcus were found resistant to vancomycin. No strains of Enterococcus were found resistant to vancomycin, the intermediate rates of E. faecalis and E. faecium to vancomycin were 3.5% (10/286) and 9.5% (4/42) respectively. All strains of Enterococcus were found 100% susceptible to teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: The resistance patterns of Gram-positive cocci including MRSA, PRSP, and AREF are similar to the results of the 1998 - 1999 surveillance. No strain of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including VRSA and VISA or vancomycin resistant enterococcus, VRE is found in this study.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  - There is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in Australian animals. Registration of antibiotics for use in animals is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. Fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. In the late 1970s, the Animal Health Committee coordinated a survey of resistance in Salmonella and Escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine Staphylococcus aureus. Some additional information is available from published case reports. In samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the market, no vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vanA enterococci, including E. faecium and E. faecalis, were found in chickens. No vanB enterococci were detected in either species. Virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig and poultry isolates. Multiple resistance was common in E. coli and salmonellae isolates. No fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, E. coli or Campylobacter. Beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. However, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of Staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli has been found in dogs.
TI  - Persistent silver disinfectant for the environmental control of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contaminated surfaces can act as a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and potentially exacerbate the risk of infection. Surface disinfection and decontamination provide temporary amelioration against bacterial colonization. Disinfected surfaces eventually become contaminated, thus, mitigating the benefit of the initial disinfection. It is hypothesized that to improve on the current state of the art, a disinfectant should not only immediately disinfect a surface but also provide persistent antimicrobial action after the product has been applied. We describe here a silver-based disinfectant technology designed to provide long-lasting sanitization and disinfection to treated surfaces as evaluated on hard surfaces after repeated environmental insults. METHODS: A comparative evaluation of 6 disinfectant formulations for residual antimicrobial activity after water rinsing was performed. Log reduction of bacterial populations on disinfectant-treated substrates were measured after 30 minutes to 8 hours of exposure and compared with an untreated control. In a similar study, the residual antimicrobial activity of a silver disinfectant was evaluated against antibiotic- and biocide-resistant bacteria also after water rinsing. Further, residual antimicrobial activity of the silver disinfectant was measured after 5 cycles of rinsing, abrasion, and contamination against representative household and nosocomial pathogens (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, or Salmonella choleraesuis) after 10-minute exposure times. RESULTS: In the comparative assay, only the silver disinfectant and a persistent quaternary ammonium compound disinfectant demonstrated significant residual activity (> or =3.0 log(10) reduction to control) against S aureus whereas only the silver disinfectant demonstrated activity against Pseudomonas. No residual activity (< or = 0.5 log reduction to untreated control) was observed for the other disinfectant products. The silver-based disinfectant also showed significant and equivalent efficacy against antibiotic- and silver-resistant bacteria. In addition, the silver disinfectant was able to achieve significant residual activity in 10 minutes against all organisms tested after 1, 3, and 5 cycles of water rinse, abrasion, and microbial contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show the ability of a new silver-based disinfectant to reduce bacterial populations that contact treated surfaces within minutes, highlight the potential to interrupt cross-contamination from environmental surfaces, and reduce the risk of infection within the home and health care settings.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus species.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the in vitro activity of daptomycin using an optimal calcium (Ca2+) concentration (50 mg/L) against a diverse collection of enterococcal and Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates, including glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). METHODS: The activity of daptomycin was compared with the activities of seven other agents against 1483 enterococcal and S. aureus clinical isolates, including 303 GRE and 193 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. Susceptibility testing was performed by the NCCLS broth microdilution method, with one exception: Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth was supplemented to a physiological level of 50 mg/L Ca2+ when testing daptomycin. Daptomycin zone diameters were determined by disc diffusion with MH agar plates containing Ca2+ 50 mg/L. RESULTS: All staphylococcal isolates tested, and the majority of enterococcal isolates (96.5%), would be considered susceptible to daptomycin if the breakpoint previously proposed of </=2 mg/L was applied. The activity of daptomycin against MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus was essentially equal. Daptomycin also had similar activity against GRE and glycopeptide-susceptible enterococci. Every S. aureus isolate had a daptomycin zone diameter > or = 20 mm, and all of the enterococcal isolates had daptomycin zone diameters > or = 17 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, daptomycin showed potent activity against S. aureus and enterococcal isolates, comparable to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid.
TI  - [Resistance to antimicrobials and combination therapy assessment in neonatal sepsis].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate antibiotic resistance among bacterial strains isolated from patients with neonatal sepsis from January 1994 through December 1998, and to assess the predictive value of the checkerboard method for selecting treatment with combination antibiotic therapy in seriously ill patients. METHODS: The study of strain susceptibility was carried out by microdilution in broth, and the checkerboard method in broth trays was used to assess the efficacy of antibiotic combination therapy. RESULTS: Fifty per cent of the strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. and 37% of S. aureus strains, which are the main pathogens involved in neonatal sepsis, were resistant to methycillin. Of these strains, 94.5% were resistant to several antibiotics. Four strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. and one strain of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to vancomycin (minimal inhibitory concentration = 128 micro g/mL). We noted a high probability of clinical efficacy (P < 0.01) with antibiotic combinations having a synergistic effect in vitro, whereas antagonic reactions were seen in close association with a highly significant probability of clinical therapeutic failure. DISCUSSION: The main cause of neonatal sepsis in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at "America Arias" Hospital in Havana, Cuba, were strains of Staphylococcus resistant to methycillin and other antibiotics. In seriously ill patients (according to policy established at this institution), the first line of treatment is a combination of an aminoglycoside antibiotic and a beta-lactamic antibiotic. This study showed that the clinical efficacy of combination antibiotic therapy is not determined by the resistance pattern of the strain and that good clinical results can be attained, in all likelihood, when a synergistic effect can be shown in vitro.
TI  - Development of a thermally regulated broad-spectrum promoter system for use in pathogenic gram-positive species.
AB  - Selectively regulating gene expression is an essential molecular tool that is lacking for many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. In this report, we describe the evaluation of a series of promoters regulated by the bacteriophage P1 temperature-sensitive C1 repressor in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the lacZ gene to monitor gene expression, we examined the strength, basal expression, and induced expression of synthetic promoters carrying C1 operator sites. The promoters exhibited extremely low basal expression and, under inducing conditions, gave high levels of expression (100- to 1,000-fold induction). We demonstrate that the promoter system could be modulated by temperature and showed rapid induction and that the mechanism of regulation occurred at the level of transcription. Controlled expression with the same constructs was also demonstrated in the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. However, low basal expression and the ability to achieve derepression were dependent on both the number of mismatches in the C1 operator sites and the promoter driving c1 expression. Since the promoters were designed to contain conserved promoter elements from gram-positive species and were constructed in a broad-host-range plasmid, this system will provide a new opportunity for controlled gene expression in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activities of linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents against Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pneumococci, and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The activities of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against  gram-positive organisms, alone and in combination with 35 antimicrobial agents were tested in vitro against methicillin-sensitive (n = 1 to 2 strains) and methicillin-resistant (n = 8 to 10) Staphylococcus aureus strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 6) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6 to 8) Enterococcus faecalis strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 5) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6) Enterococcus faecium strains; penicillin-sensitive (n = 2 to 5), penicillin-intermediate (n = 5 to 6), and penicillin-resistant (n = 5 to 6) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains; Escherichia coli (n = 6); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 6). The fractional inhibitory concentration indices of linezolid in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the organisms tested were generated on checkerboard broth microdilution plates prepared by a semiautomated method. Of 1,380 organism-drug combinations, 1,369 (99.2%) combinations of linezolid with 28 antimicrobial drugs were indifferent, 9 combinations (0.65%) of linezolid with 6 drugs (amoxicillin, erythromycin, imipenem, sparfloxacin, teicoplanin, and tetracycline) were synergistic, and 2 combinations (0.15%) of linezolid with 2 drugs (ofloxacin and sparfloxacin) were antagonistic. Overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents primarily produces an indifferent response, with infrequent occurrences of synergism and antagonism.
TI  - Nocathiacins, new thiazolyl peptide antibiotics from Nocardia sp. I. Taxonomy, fermentation and biological activities.
AB  - Thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, nocathiacin I, II and III, were identified in a culture of Nocardia sp. WW-12651 (ATCC 202099). They exhibit potent in vitro activity (ng/ml) against a wide spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, including multiple-drug resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multi-drug resistant Enterococcus faecium (MREF) and fully penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and demonstrate excellent in vivo efficacy in a systemic Staphylococcus aureus infection mice model.
TI  - Novel pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based inhibitors of Staphlococcus aureus DNA polymerase III: design, synthesis, and biological evaluation.
AB  - 6-Anilinopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ones are novel dGTP analogues that inhibit the replication-specific enzyme DNA polymerase III (DNA pol III) of Staphlococcus aureus and other Gram-positive (Gr+) bacteria. To enhance the potential of these inhibitors as antimicrobial agents, a structure-activity relationship was developed involving substitutions at the 2, 4, and pyrazolo NH positions. All of the new inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit S. aureus DNA pol III and the growth of several other Gr+ bacteria in culture. 2-Anilino groups with small hydrophobic groups in the meta or para position enhanced both antipolymerase and antimicrobial activity. 2-Benzyl-substituted inhibitors were substantially less active. Substitution in the 4-position by oxygen gave the optimal activity, whereas substitution at the pyrazolo NH was not tolerated. These pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives represent a novel class of antimicrobials with promising activities against Gr+ bacteria.
TI  - Baseline study to determine in vitro activities of daptomycin against gram-positive pathogens isolated in the United States in 2000-2001.
AB  - The activity of daptomycin was assessed by using 6,973 gram-positive bacteria isolated at 50 United States hospitals in 2000 and 2001. Among the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,163) collected, the rate of penicillin resistance was 16.1%; rates of oxacillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus isolates (n = 1,018) and vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium isolates (n = 368) were 30.0 and 59.5%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes (isolates resistant to three or more different chemical classes of antimicrobial agents) accounted for 14.2% of S. pneumoniae isolates, 27.1% of S. aureus isolates, and 58.4% of E. faecium isolates. For all gram-positive species tested, MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (MIC(90)s) and MIC ranges for directed-spectrum agents (daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and linezolid) were identical or highly similar for isolates susceptible or resistant to other agents or MDR. Daptomycin had a MIC(90) of 0.12 micro g/ml for both penicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of S. pneumoniae. Against oxacillin-resistant S. aureus daptomycin had a MIC(90) of 0.5 micro g/ml, and it had a MIC(90) of 4 micro g/ml against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. faecium. The MIC(90)s for daptomycin and other directed-spectrum agents were unaffected by the regional or anatomical origin of isolates or patient demographic parameters (patient age, gender, and inpatient or outpatient care). Our results confirm the gram-positive spectrum of activity of daptomycin and that its activity is independent of susceptibility or resistance to commonly prescribed and tested antimicrobial agents. This study may serve as a baseline to monitor future changes in the susceptibility of gram-positive species to daptomycin following its introduction into clinical use.
TI  - Daptomycin dose-effect relationship against resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Daptomycin exhibits in vitro bactericidal activity against clinically significant gram-positive bacteria. We employed pharmacodynamic modeling to determine a once-daily dosing regimen of daptomycin that correlates to pharmacodynamic endpoints for different resistant gram-positive clinical strains. An in vitro pharmacodynamic model with an initial inoculum of 6 log(10) CFU/ml was used to simulate daptomycin regimens ranging in dose from 0 to 9 mg/kg of body weight/day, with corresponding exposures reflecting free-daptomycin concentrations in serum. Bacterial density was profiled over 48 h for two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA-67 and -R515), two glycopeptide intermediate-resistant S. aureus (GISA-992 and -147398), and two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF-12366 and -SF12047) strains. A sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the effective dose required to achieve 50% (ED(50)) and 80% (ED(80)) bacterial density reduction at 48 h. Daptomycin MICs for study isolates ranged from 0.125 to 4 micro g/ml. Model fitting resulted in an r(2) of >0.80 for all tested isolates. Control growths at 48 h ranged from 7.3 to 8.5 log(10) CFU/ml. Sigmoid relationships were not superimposable between categorical resistant species: ED(50) and ED(80) values were 1.9 and 3.1, 4.2 and 5.6, and 5.4 and 6.8 mg/kg for MRSA, GISA, and VREF isolates, respectively. Doses required to achieve ED(50) and ED(80) values correlated with MIC differences between tested organisms. Corresponding area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h/MIC exposure ratios demonstrated a wide range of ED(80) values among the tested isolates. Doses ranging between 3 and 7 mg/kg produced significant bactericidal activity (ED(80)) against these multidrug-resistant S. aureus and E. faecium isolates.
TI  - In vitro activity of gatifloxacin alone and in combination with cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin and gentamicin against multidrug-resistant organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the in vitro interaction of gatifloxacin in combination with gentamicin and with the beta-lactams cefepime, meropenem and piperacillin against clinical isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS: The activity of each drug alone was determined by an agar dilution method. Chequerboard synergy testing was then performed against all the isolates. Time-kill assays were done on selected isolates to assess correlation with the chequerboard results. RESULTS: Synergy was demonstrated with the following combinations at achievable serum concentrations: gatifloxacin/piperacillin for 80% and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 60% of S. maltophilia; gatifloxacin/gentamicin for 60%, and gatifloxacin/cefepime for 50% of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and in all drug combinations for 50-70% of P. aeruginosa. Indifference was noted for the majority of B. cepacia and VRE isolates. Antagonism at therapeutic serum levels was observed with gatifloxacin/piperacillin against a single isolate of B. cepacia. No distinct trend in drug interaction was seen with the different drug combinations against MRSA. Time-kill analyses against selected isolates confirmed the synergic activity of the following drug combinations seen in the chequerboard assays: gatifloxacin/cefepime and gatifloxacin/piperacillin against P. aeruginosa, gatifloxacin/gentamicin against B. cepacia, and gatifloxacin/gentamicin and gatifloxacin/meropenem against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin was synergic with the beta-lactams piperacillin, cefepime and meropenem, and with gentamicin against some drug-resistant pathogens. Some of the time-kill analyses against P. aeruginosa, B. cepacia and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae were in accordance with chequerboard results. Time-kill analyses against S. maltophilia did not confirm the synergy seen in chequerboard testing.
TI  - Clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium exhibit strain-specific collagen binding mediated by Acm, a new member of the MSCRAMM family.
AB  - A collagen-binding adhesin of Enterococcus faecium, Acm, was identified. Acm shows 62% similarity to the Staphylococcus aureus collagen adhesin Cna over the entire protein and is more similar to Cna (60% and 75% similarity with Cna A and B domains respectively) than to the Enterococcus faecalis collagen-binding adhesin, Ace, which shares homology with Acm only in the A domain. Despite the detection of acm in 32 out of 32 E. faecium isolates, only 11 of these (all clinical isolates, including four vancomycin-resistant endocarditis isolates and seven other isolates) exhibited binding to collagen type I (CI). Although acm from three CI-binding vancomycin-resistant E. faecium clinical isolates showed 100% identity, analysis of acm genes and their promoter regions from six non-CI-binding strains identified deletions or mutations that introduced stop codons and/or IS elements within the gene or the promoter region in five out of six strains, suggesting that the presence of an intact functional acm gene is necessary for binding of E. faecium strains to CI. Recombinant Acm A domain showed specific and concentration-dependent binding to collagen, and this protein competed with E. faecium binding to immobilized CI. Consistent with the adherence phenotype and sequence data, probing with Acm-specific IgGs purified from anti-recombinant Acm A polyclonal rabbit serum confirmed the surface expression of Acm in three out of three collagen-binding clinical isolates of E. faecium tested, but in none of the strains with a non-functional pseudo acm gene. Introduction of a functional acm gene into two non-CI-binding natural acm mutant strains conferred a CI-binding phenotype, further confirming that native Acm is sufficient for the binding of E. faecium to CI. These results demonstrate that acm, which encodes a potential virulence factor, is functional only in certain infection-derived clinical isolates of E. faecium, and suggest that Acm is the primary adhesin responsible for the ability of E. faecium to bind collagen.
TI  - Activity of daptomycin against susceptible and multidrug-resistant Gram-positive  pathogens collected in the SECURE study (Europe) during 2000-2001.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance was prevalent in Gram-positive pathogens collected from 40  sites in 15 European countries during 2000-2001. Among Staphylococcus aureus, 27.3% of all isolates submitted were resistant to oxacillin and ranged from 0% of isolates from the Netherlands to 36.9% of isolates from Portugal. The overall prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was 25.1%, with Italy submitting the largest percentage of resistant isolates (60.6%). For Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9.4% of all isolates collected were resistant to penicillin with variation by country from 0% in the Netherlands to 20.7% in Portugal. Multidrug resistance (MDR), defined as concurrent resistance to three or more antimicrobials of different chemical classes, was observed in 24.6% of S. aureus, 19.6% of E. faecium and 3.6% of S. pneumoniae. The directed spectrum agents daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active in vitro against all isolates regardless of their resistance to other agents. Daptomycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin (MIC(90)s 0.5 mg/L) were equally active against oxacillin-resistant S. aureus compared with linezolid (MIC(90) 2 mg/L). The activities of daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid were not affected by resistance to vancomycin in E. faecium (MIC(90)s of 4, 2 and 2 mg/L, respectively). Daptomycin was more active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.25 mg/L) than was quinupristin-dalfopristin (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) or linezolid (MIC(90) 2 mg/L). Daptomycin was highly active against clinically important Gram-positive pathogens, including those that were multiply resistant to currently available agents. The results of this study provide a benchmark of the activity of daptomycin against contemporary European isolates and will serve as a baseline to monitor future changes in the susceptibility of these organisms to daptomycin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase productivity of recent clinical  isolates during the period between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testings of 24 antimicrobial agents against 605 clinical strains belonging to 10 species were carried out according to the micro-broth dilution method of NCCLS M7-A4. The productivity of beta-lactamase was also determined against them isolated at 8 medical facilities in Nagano prefecture, Japan during the period between December 1999 and February 2000. When applied the nitrocefin method, beta-lactamase productivity was demonstrated to be positive for 89.2% of 74 S. aureus, 4.3% of 94 H. influenzae, and 100% of 69 M. (B.) catarrhalis isolates. On the other hand, when used the acidometry method, penicillinase/cephalosporinase were found to be positive for 21.2%/9.6% of 52 E. coli, 29.0%/3.2% of 31 K. pneumoniae, 53.2%/100% of 47 E. cloacae, 0%/11.1% of 99 S. marcescens, and 25.9%/55.6% of 54 P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. Among the beta-lactamase-producers including P. aeruginosa isolates, only 2 E. coli isolates were found to be ESBL-producers. Besides, 9.6% (9/94) of H. influenzae isolates were proved to be BLNAR strains.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and prevalence of beta-lactamase producing clinical isolates in southern Kyushu. The results of collaborative study from 1999 to 2000].
AB  - The positivity of beta-lactamase and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined in a total of 1,358 clinical isolates at 15 hospitals and clinics in four prefectures in southern Kyushu (Okinawa, Miyazaki, Kagoshima and Kumamoto) during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. The isolates collected comprised of 176 strains of S. aureus, 203 of H. influenzae, 102 of M. catarrhalis, 206 of E. coli, 153 of K. pneumoniae, 99 of E. cloacae, 95 of S. marcescens, 201 of P. aeruginosa, 79 of E. faecalis, and 44 of E. faecium. The frequency of CPDX resistance among E. coli in particular varied geographically, and was found to be higher in Kumamoto and Kagoshima. The strains of K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae resistant to common antimicrobial agents were particularly found in Kagoshima, and one strain of IPM-resistant E. cloacae was isolated in Miyazaki. Also, the geographical difference in the frequency of LVFX resistance among the isolates of E. cloacae was noted, the results indicating the higher prevalence in Okinawa and Kagoshima. Resistant isolates of P. aeruginosa were less common in Kagoshima, and four isolates of P. aeruginosa from Miyazaki were found to be resistant to CAZ and IPM. None of the isolates of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. was resistant to VCM or TEIC at all. The isolates of E. faecalis resistant at high-level GM (500 micrograms/ml) and SM (1,000 micrograms/ml) were found in 27.8% and 22.8%, and those of E. faecium were 6.8% and 38.6%, respectively. Overall, the ratio of MRSA among S. aureus was 67.6%, and three isolates were resistant to ABK with no less than 8 micrograms/ml of MIC. The frequency of BLNAR (beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin resistant) among H. influenzae isolated in Okinawa was markedly higher (isolation ratio, 37.9%) when compared with other prefectures, and the isolates of BLPACR (beta-lactamase-positive, AMPC/CVA resistant) were found only in Okinawa with a ratio of 41.6%. A total of 18 strains of ESBL defined by the NCCLS criteria (M100-S11) were isolated, eight strains of K. pneumoniae and 10 strains of E. coli. Of 18 isolates of ESBL, 13 were from Kagoshima and the remaining five were from Kumamoto.
TI  - [Beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics among some species of bacteria isolated from medical institution between December 1999 and February 2000].
AB  - We studied the beta-lactamase activity and susceptibilities to antibiotics in 604 strains among 10 species of bacteria isolated from 10 medical institutions in Tottori and Shimane Prefectures between December 1999 and February 2000. beta-Lactamase activity was measured by the nitrocefin test and penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were measured by acidometry. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 72.1% of S. aureus, 18.8% of H. influenzae, and 96.3% of M. catarrhalis. Penicillinase/cephalosporinase activities were detected in 17.8%/22.2% of E. coli, 9.7%/0.0% of K. pneumoniae, 18.6%/95.3% of E. cloacae, 12.7%/79.4% of S. marcescens, and 7.1%/31.8% of P. aeruginosa. Three of 72 strains (4.2%) of K. pneumoniae and 5 of 90 strains (5.6%) of E. coli were assessed as ESBL-producing bacteria using the NCCLS proposed screening method based on routine susceptibility testing results. BLNAR were detected in 13 of 69 strains (18.8%) of H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility of bacteria clinically isolated during the period from December 1999 to February 2000].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase producibility were tested in 848  clinical strains collected at 8 hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture during the period from December 1999 to February 2000. Positive rates of beta-lactamase used the nitrocefin method (Cefinase) were 21.9% of Staphylococcus aureus, 10.0% of Haemophilus influenzae, and 99.0% of Moraxella catarrhalis. Furthermore, on the acidometric method (P/Case test) penicillinase (PCase), cephalosporinase (CEPase), and both of PCase and CEPase were found to be positive in 19.0%, 16.0%, and 16.0% for Escherichia coli, 6.2/0/3.1% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/66.3/26.5% for Enterobacter cloacae, 2.8/57.7/15.5% for Serratia marcescens, and 4.0/15.0/22.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. Based on the assessment of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents among beta-lactamase producing strains, there were 5 strains (4 strains of K. pneumoniae and 1 strain of E. coli) that may be ESBLs producing bacteria out of a total of 466 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. During this process, 1 strain of class-B beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae was isolated. MRSA were found in 79.2% of S. aureus, and BLNAR were found in 8.9% of H. influenzae.
TI  - [beta-lactamase-producing activity and antimicrobial susceptibility of major pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples. Japan beta-lactamase Research Group].
AB  - beta-Lactamase production and susceptibility to an assortment of antimicrobial agents were examined in 9,483 strains of organisms isolated from clinical materials obtained from inpatients and outpatients at 104 institutions throughout Japan from December 1999 to February 2000. The organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, 1,369 strains, including 847 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains; Enterococcus faecalis, 735 strains; Enterococcus faecium, 302 strains; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, 730 strains; Haemophilus influenzae, 1,142 strains; Escherichia coli, 1,276 strains; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,058 strains; Enterobacter cloacae, 772 strains; Serratia marcescens, 847 strains; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1,252 strains. The 23 antimicrobial agents used were ampicillin, sulbactam/ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotiam, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpodoxime, imipenem, gentamicin, arbekacin, clarithromycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and levofloxacin. Antimicrobial agents appropriate for each organism were used. Among S. aureus strains, 61.9% were MRSA, and 62.3% were positive for beta-lactamase. Among the MRSA strains, none was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin, and only 3% were resistant to arbekacin. There was no vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus strains. Only 0.1% of E. faecalis strains were ampicillin-resistant. Among the M. catarrhalis strains, 97.5% produced beta-lactamase, while among the H. influenzae strains, 8.5% produced beta-lactamase and 14.5% were beta-lactamase-negative and ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR). Among the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa strains, there were 20 (E. coli; 7/1,276, K. pneumoniae; 13/1,058) that produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), and 11 that produced class B beta-lactamases. Multiple drug resistance was advanced in every species, and organisms resistant to 7 or more common antimicrobial agents were isolated. The best combination of antimicrobial agent and beta-lactamase inhibitor was sulbactam/cefoperazone. Sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefepime, and imipenem still have excellent antimicrobial activity. Rates of resistance to each antimicrobial agent differed more among institutions than among geographical regions.
TI  - Prospective study using standardized methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from the Puerto Rico Medical Center.
AB  - The Gram-positive cocci (GPC), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, have become important causes of community and nosocomial-acquired infections. The prevalence of multiple resistant isolates to standard antimicrobial drugs has significantly increased over the past decades. Few prospective studies have been performed in Puerto Rico (PR) concerning the GPC antimicrobial susceptibilities pattern. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of GPC clinical isolates from PR to selected standard antibiotics and to the new antimicrobial agents, linezolid (LZ), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and gemifloxacin (GM). The in vitro susceptibility utilizing disk diffusion and Etest methods to selected antibiotics was determined for a total of 429 isolates obtained during a period of 5 months from the Puerto Rico Medical Center Bacteriology Laboratory. The distribution of GPC collected was as follows: 213 S. aureus isolates, 162 E. faecalis, 16 E. faecium and 38 S. pneumoniae. The results of the susceptibility test demonstrated: 1) that in S. aureus, 100% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (VAN), LZ and Q/D; 93% to GM; and 61% to methicillin/oxacillin; 2) in S. pneumoniae, 100% were susceptible to LN and GM; 87% to Q/D; and 53% to penicillin; 3) in E. faecalis, 99% were susceptible to ampicillin; 93% to LZ; 79% to GM; 78.6% to VAN; and 0% to Q/D. Sixty eight and 66% of the E. faecalis isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin respectively; and 4) in E. faecium, 100% were susceptible to LZ; 94% to Q/D; 69% to GM; 37.5% to VAN and 20% to ampicillin. In E. faecium isolates, 50% and 31% were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. Of the vancomycin resistant enterococci, 88.9% and 21% of E. faecium and faecalis showed VanA phenotypic resistance, respectively. These results show that there is a significant degree of antimicrobial resistance in GPC, including 38% methicillin resistance in S. aureus, a near 50% penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, and a significant resistance of enterococcal species to VAN. The new agents, LZ, Q/D and GM, proved to be effective against both, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. For E. faecium, both, LZ and Q/D were active, while for E. faecalis, only LZ showed consistent activity.
TI  - Multicentre evaluation of the in vitro activity of linezolid in the Western Pacific.
AB  - Multiresistance to antimicrobial agents is common in staphylococci and pneumococci isolates in the Western Pacific region. The activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was evaluated against a spectrum of Gram-positive species collected in the region. Eighteen laboratories from six countries in the Western Pacific examined the linezolid susceptibility of 2143 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Enterococcus spp. using broth microdilution or disc diffusion methodology. For Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 351) and other streptococci (n = 83), Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) strips were used. Results were compared with other common and important antimicrobials. Linezolid-resistant strains were not detected among streptococci or staphylococci, including a significant proportion of S. aureus strains that were multiresistant. Almost all enterococci, including 14 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, were linezolid susceptible. A small proportion of enterococci (0.8%) were intermediate to linezolid, and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis had a zone diameter of 20 mm (resistant). The linezolid MIC ranges (MIC(90)) of those strains tested by broth microdilution or Etest were: 1-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for S. aureus, 0.5-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for CoNS, 0.5-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for Enterococcus spp., 0.12-2 mg/L (1 mg/L) for S. pneumoniae and 0.25-2 mg/L (1 mg/L) for Streptococcus spp. There was no difference in linezolid susceptibility between countries or between multiresistant and susceptible strains of each species monitored.
TI  - MC21-A, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We previously reported a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In the present study, we purified an anti-MRSA substance (MC21-A) from the methanol extract of the cells of P. phenolica O-BC30(T) and analyzed its chemical structure. MC21-A was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. Its anti-MRSA activity against 10 clinical isolates of MRSA was comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A MICs, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin MICs, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). This substance was also high active against Enterococcus serolicida, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis but was less active against Streptococcus spp. A time-kill study also demonstrated that MC21-A was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of MC21-A against a clinical MRSA isolate, strain E 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A PAEs, 1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin PAEs, 0.84 to 1.43 h). However, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse MRSA cells. This substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. A SYTOX Green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of MRSA as its mode of action. When its activities against a hypersensitive Escherichia coli mutant (KO 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, MC21-A exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. Furthermore, MC21-A was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and Vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. These results suggest that MC21-A might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-MRSA substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - Linezolid: an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The pharmacology, antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse effects of linezolid are reviewed. Linezolid, the only oxazolidinone antimicrobial approved for use in the United States, has significant activity against gram-positive bacteria, including penicillin-, cephalosporin-, and vancomycin-resistant species. Linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis via binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit to prevent translation. The drug lacks cross-resistance with other antimicrobials. Linezolid is primarily excreted renally as unchanged drug. The measured plasma half-life of four to five hours permits twice-daily administration for all indicated infections. Virtually complete oral bioavailability allows for 1:1 conversion between the intravenous and oral dosage forms. Controlled comparative clinical trials demonstrate that linezolid is effective in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia, and skin and skin-structure infections due to susceptible organisms. The recommended dosage is 600 mg i.v. or p.o. twice daily for all indications except uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections (400 mg twice daily); adjustments for mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment are not necessary. Clinically important interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors have not been observed. Reversible myelosuppression has been observed in a few patients. Linezolid has gram-positive activity comparable to that of vancomycin, is effective in a variety of infections, and is well tolerated, with diarrhea, headache, and nausea being the most frequently reported adverse effects. Linezolid provides a reasonable therapeutic alternative for patients with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections and patients infected with MRSA who cannot tolerate vancomycin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of naphthazarins from Arnebia euchroma.
AB  - Bioassay-directed fractionation of extract of Arnebia euchroma led to the isolation of alkannin (1), shikonin (2), and their derivatives (3-8) as the active principles against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The stereochemistry of alpha-methylbutyryl alkannin (8) is revealed for the first time, and the antimicrobial activity of 8 was compared with its corresponding diastereomer (9). The derivatives 3-9 showed stronger anti-MRSA activity [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranged from 1.56 to 3.13 microg/mL] than alkannin or shikonin (MIC = 6.25 microg/mL). Anti-MRSA activity of derivatives was bactericidal with minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)/MIC < or = 2. In a time-kill assay, the bactericidal activity against MRSA was achieved as rapidly as 2 h. The derivatives 3-9 were also active against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (F935) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (CKU-17) with MICs similar to those with MRSA. Aromatic ester derivatives were also synthesized for antimicrobial activity comparison. None of these compounds were active against Gram-negative bacteria tested. Their cytotoxicity was also evaluated on selected cancer cell lines, and they expressed their activity in the range 0.6-5.4 microg/mL (CD(50)). Our results indicate that the ester derivatives of alkannin are potential candidates of anti-MRSA and anti-VRE agents with antitumor activity.
TI  - Comparison of linezolid activities under aerobic and anaerobic conditions against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were exposed to linezolid (MIC of 2 mg/liter) under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model. Drug concentration and half-life were adjusted to simulate clinical dosing (600 mg twice daily) of linezolid. Linezolid produced a 2-log(10) killing at 24 h, and rates of killing against each of these facultative organisms as measured by mean survival time appeared similar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tigecycline (GAR-936) against Enterococcus faecium and  Staphylococcus aureus used alone and in combination.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial properties of tigecycline, both alone and in combination with other antibiotics, against multidrug-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. DESIGN: In vitro study. SETTING: University laboratory. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Tigecycline, both alone and in combination with other antimicrobial agents, was evaluated against two strains of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF), three glycopeptide-intermediately resistant S. aureus strains, and one methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain. Tigecycline's activity was compared with that of vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, and doxycycline, using time-kill studies and analysis of minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations. Tigecycline also was evaluated in combination with vancomycin, gentamicin, rifampin, and doxycycline in time-kill studies. The number of log10 colony-forming units/ml at 24 hours was compared among treatment groups and growth control by analysis of variance. All isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, regardless of their susceptibilities to vancomycin or doxycycline. In time-kill studies, tigecycline significantly inhibited the bacterial inoculum of all isolates (p < 0.05). Although none of the tigecycline combinations studied had enhanced killing activity against VREF, when gentamicin was combined with tigecycline, improved effects were found against both strains. Against three of the S. aureus strains tested, the combination of gentamicin and tigecycline demonstrated enhanced or improved activity independently of each strain's susceptibility to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: The multidrug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria tested, including doxycycline-resistant isolates, were susceptible to tigecycline. The combination of tigecycline and gentamicin may have improved or enhanced activity against strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and S. aureus.
TI  - Chemistry and biology of the ramoplanin family of peptide antibiotics.
AB  - The peptide antibiotic ramoplanin factor A2 is a promising clinical candidate for treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections that are resistant to antibiotics such as glycopeptides, macrolides, and penicillins. Since its discovery in 1984, no clinical or laboratory-generated resistance to this antibiotic has been reported. The mechanism of action of ramoplanin involves sequestration of peptidoglycan biosynthesis Lipid intermediates, thus physically occluding these substrates from proper utilization by the late-stage peptidoglycan biosynthesis enzymes MurG and the transglycosylases (TGases). Ramoplanin is structurally related to two cell wall active lipodepsipeptide antibiotics, janiemycin, and enduracidin, and is functionally related to members of the lantibiotic class of antimicrobial peptides (mersacidin, actagardine, nisin, and epidermin) and glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). Peptidomimetic chemotherapeutics derived from the ramoplanin sequence may find future use as antibiotics against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and related pathogens. Here we review the chemistry and biology of the ramoplanins including its discovery, structure elucidation, biosynthesis, antimicrobial activity, mechanism of action, and total synthesis.
TI  - Synthesis of novel nocathiacin-class antibiotics. Condensation of glycolaldehyde  with primary amides and tandem reductive amination of amadori-rearranged 2-oxoethyl intermediates.
AB  - Nocathiacin I (1) and nocathiacin IV (2) are novel indole-containing thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, which exhibit potent activity against key Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including multi drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium. New nocathiacins 7-12 were prepared from 2 by a condensation with glycolaldehyde followed by tandem reductive amination of the 2-oxoethyl intermediate 4. The latter was formed via Amadori rearrangement from initial 2-hydroxyethylideneamide 3. This transformation readily tolerates the complex architecture of nocathiacins and allows selective incorporation of water solubilizing groups to the primary amide in 2 without protecting group manipulation.
TI  - Evaluation of dedicated stethoscopes as a potential source of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the ear tips of dedicated stethoscopes (DS) that  are used on patients prescribed contact precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii become contaminated with these micro-organisms. DESIGN: Culture of DS ear tips. SETTING: A 524-bed tertiary care university hospital. METHODS: DS ear tips were inoculated directly onto bacteriologic media and incubated for 48 to 72 hours. Growth of more than 10 colonies from the 2 ear tips collectively was indicative of contamination. RESULTS: Ear tips of 78 DS from 69 patients were cultured. Ear tips from 17% (13/78) of the DS were contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria: 2 with S aureus (1 MRSA), 1 with E faecalis, 7 with Acinetobacter species, 2 with Pseudomonas species, 1 with Escherichia coli, and 1 with Moraxella. None of the stethoscope ear tips was contaminated with the same pathogen for which the patient was prescribed contact precautions (95% CI, 0-3.8%). CONCLUSION: Although the ear tips of DS from patients who were prescribed contact precautions for MRSA, vancomycin-resistant E faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant A baumannii were not contaminated with the indicated nosocomial pathogen, 94% of the evaluable ear tips were contaminated, including with MRSA (1.3%) and Acinetobacter (11%). Regular disinfection of ear tips of DS between users should be considered.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - Different bacteriocin activities of Streptococcus mutans reflect distinct phylogenetic lineages.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by mutans streptococci are known as mutacins. In this study 16 broadly active mutacin-producing Streptococcus mutans strains from New Zealand, North America and Europe were classified into four groups (A-D) on the basis of differences in their activity in deferred antagonism tests against either the homologous producer strain (to test for presence of self-immunity) or indicator strains Staphylococcus aureus 46 and Enterococcus faecium TE1. Two of the strains included in the study (UA140 and UA96) were representatives of the group I and II mutacin producer strains previously described by Caufield and co-workers. One of the New Zealand isolates of group A (S. mutans strain N) appeared to produce inhibitory activity similar to that of the group I prototype strain UA140. Four other New Zealand isolates of group B (S. mutans strains M19, M34, B34 and D14) had mutacin II-like activity. The group B mutacin producers differed from the group A mutacin producers in their additional activity against Staph. aureus 46. Seven S. mutans strains (M46, B46, B57, M12, M28, B28 and 13M) were distinguished from the group A and group B mutacin producers in that they inhibited E. faecium TE1. These were called group C mutacin producers. Strains H7 and H23 resembled the group C strains in their action on both indicator strains TE1 and 46. However, these two strains failed to exhibit immunity to their own inhibitory products in the deferred antagonism test and were separately classified as group D mutacin producers. Phylogenetic analysis of the strains by several genotypic and phenotypic characteristics revealed that the mutacin groups were associated with distinct evolutionary lineages of S. mutans.
TI  - Population-based assessment of intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections in adults: Incidence, risk factors, and associated mortality rate.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nosocomial bloodstream infections have been extensively investigated,  but relatively few studies have specifically evaluated the epidemiology of intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections. The study objective was to define the incidence, risk factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections. DESIGN: Population-based prospective cohort. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care units. PATIENTS: All Calgary Health Region (population 930,000) adult patients admitted to multidisciplinary intensive care units (>/=48 hrs) from May 1, 1999, to April 30, 2000. INTERVENTIONS: Blood sample analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: There were 1,158 admission episodes in 1,017 patients; 37% involved females, and mean +/- sd age and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were 59.6 +/- 18.7 yrs and 23.4 +/- 7.7, respectively. Fifty-one patients developed intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections (first positive blood culture >/=48 hrs after intensive care unit admission) for an incidence of 4.4% and an incidence density of 5.2 per 1000 intensive care unit days. Younger age (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.00, p =.01), longer intensive care unit length of stay (adjusted odds ratio, 4.74; 95% CI, 3.26-6.90, p <.001), and lower hematocrit (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.00, p =.04) were significant independent predictors of intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections, and these infections were associated with an increased intensive care unit length of stay of 2.86 days (95% confidence interval, 2.29-3.57, p <.001). Staphylococcus aureus (27%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (14%), and Enterococcus faecium (12%) were most commonly isolated. Four (8%) bloodstream infections involved antibiotic-resistant organisms, and ten (20%) were polymicrobial. In multivariate analysis, intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infection was associated with an increased intensive care unit mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-4.00, p = 0.04) but not overall hospital mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: One patient in 20 admitted to Calgary Health Region intensive care units acquires bloodstream infection and suffers longer intensive care unit stay and increased mortality rates. In our region, multiple antibiotic-resistant organisms are uncommon causes of bloodstream infections, suggesting that it may be safe to use narrower spectrum empirical treatment regimens than current guidelines recommend.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - Mode of action of the antimicrobial peptide aureocin A53 from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We investigated the mode of action of aureocin A53 on living bacterial cells and  model membranes. Aureocin A53 acted bactericidally against Staphylococcus simulans 22, with >90% of the cells killed within a few minutes. Cell death was followed by lysis, as indicated by a clearing of the cell suspension and Gram staining. Aureocin A53 rapidly dissipated the membrane potential and simultaneously stopped biosynthesis of DNA, polysaccharides, and protein. Aureocin A53 induced a rapid release of preaccumulated glutamate and Rb(+). Experiments on model membranes demonstrated that aureocin A53 provoked significant leakage of carboxyfluorescein (CF) exclusively from acidic liposomes but only at relatively high concentrations (0.5 to 8 mol%). Thus, the bactericidal activity of aureocin A53 derives from membrane permeation via generalized membrane destruction rather than by formation of discrete pores within membranes. Tryptophan emission fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated interaction of aureocin A53 with both acidic and neutral membranes, as indicated by similar blue shifts. Since there was no significant aureocin A53-induced CF leakage from neutral liposomes, its appears that the peptide does interact with neutral lipids without provoking membrane damage.
TI  - Treatment of life-threatening multiresistant staphylococcal and enterococcal infections in patients with end-stage renal failure with quinupristin/dalfopristin: preliminary report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Life-threatening infections with multiresistant gram-positive bacteria are increasing. Treatment with quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D) has turned out to be effective against such resistant pathogens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on treatment of six patients on dialysis (four with additional liver injury) and of one renal graft recipient with normal renal function who had severe infections caused by multiresistant Staphylococus epidermidis (1/7), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4/7) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (2/7). RESULTS: Six out of seven patients were cured by therapy with Q-D in adjusted doses lasting for 10 to 34 days. Pharmacokinetics of Q-D and its metabolites were determined and remained within the therapeutic range, despite a modest increase of all compounds at the presumed steady state. The concentrations of the metabolites of Q-D were clearly lower than the parent drugs, including those of quinupristin-conjugated derivatives, which has not been reported previously. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that: a) neither quinupristin nor dalfopristin or its metabolites accumulated despite the long duration of treatment; b) no adjustment of the standard dosage regimen (three times 7.5 mg/kg/day) is necessary in end-stage renal disease.
TI  - Design of non-cysteine-containing antimicrobial beta-hairpins: structure-activity relationship studies with linear protegrin-1 analogues.
AB  - Protegrins are short, cationic peptides that display potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. PG-1, the first of the five natural analogues discovered, forms a rigid antiparallel two-stranded beta-sheet that is stabilized by two disulfide bonds. The two strands of the sheet are linked by a short two-residue loop segment. Removal of the disulfide bridges (e.g., in Cys --> Ala analogues) is known to cause marked loss of antimicrobial activity. We have used basic principles of beta-hairpin design to develop linear analogues of PG-1 that lack cysteine but nevertheless display PG-1-like activity. Our most potent reengineered molecules contain three essential design features: (i) the four cysteine residues of PG-1 are replaced by residues that have high propensity for beta-strand conformation, (ii) D-proline is placed at the i + 1 position of the reverse turn to promote a type II' beta-turn, and (iii) amino functionality is incorporated at the gamma-carbon of the D-proline residue to mimic the charge distribution of the natural beta-hairpin. Structural studies revealed that the antimicrobial potency of the non-disulfide-bonded peptides can be correlated to the stability of the beta-hairpin conformations they adopt in aqueous solution. The presence of 150 mM NaCl was found to have little effect on the antimicrobial activity of PG-1, but one of our linear analogues loses some potency under these high salt conditions. Despite this discrepancy in salt sensitivity, NMR and CD data indicate that neither PG-1 nor our linear analogue experiences a significant decrease in beta-hairpin conformational stability in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. Thus, salt inactivation is not due to destabilization of the beta-hairpin conformation. Furthermore, our results show that beta-sheet design principles can be used to replace conformation-stabilizing disulfide bridges with noncovalent conformation-stabilizing features.
TI  - [Interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  mecA, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. In relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsB, the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been recently described. In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for Staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vanA is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.
TI  - Strategies to control antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is becoming a worldwide concern. Antibiotic resistance may  be caused by sporadic mutations, which are not important unless spread clonally. Clonal resistance may disseminate a highly resistant clone to widespread geographic areas. The most effective interventions to limit the clonal spread of resistant organisms are effective infection control measures. Hospital antibiotic formulary restriction is the only control measure with proven effectiveness to control resistance related to antibiotic use. Hospital formularies should eliminate or restrict antibiotics with a high-resistance potential (eg, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem), and should be replaced with equivalent antibiotics with a low-resistance potential (eg, cefe-pime, levofloxacin, and meropenem). Such low-resistance-potential antibiotics can either prevent or eliminate resistance problems associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. High-resistance-potential antibiotics, particularly ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime, also may indirectly increase the prevalence of highly resistant organisms (eg, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE]). Vancomycin use should be restricted, not because it increases enterococcal resistance per se, but because it selects out naturally resistant enterococcal strains (eg, Enterococcus faecium that are vancomycin resistant). Linezolid does not increase the prevalence of VRE. Clinicians in the outpatient setting should also preferentially use oral antibiotics with a low-resistance potential (eg, clindamycin, metronidazole, doxycycline, minocycline, fluoroquinolones except ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and oral cephalosporins) in preference to their high-resistance-potential counterparts. For antibiotic resistance control interventions to be effective, they must be applied simultaneously to all antibiotics with activity against the specific resistance pathogen at the hospital formulary level. Multiple antibiotic substitutions are usually necessary to eradicate resistance problems caused by a particular pathogen. Multiple drugs of the same spectrum and low-resistance potential are necessary to eliminate resistance problems; single antibiotic substitutions are not effective.
TI  - The 2.4-A crystal structure of the penicillin-resistant penicillin-binding protein PBP5fm from Enterococcus faecium in complex with benzylpenicillin.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are membrane proteins involved in the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis and represent the targets of beta-lactam antibiotics. Enterococci are naturally resistant to these antibiotics because they produce a PBP, named PBP5fm in Enterococcus faecium, with low-level affinity for beta-lactams. We report here the crystal structure of the acyl-enzyme complex of PBP5fm with benzylpenicillin at a resolution of 2.4 A. A characteristic of the active site, which distinguishes PBP5fm from other PBPs of known structure, is the topology of the loop 451-465 defining the left edge of the cavity. The residue Arg464, involved in a salt bridge with the residue Asp481, confers a greater rigidity to the PBP5fm active site. In addition, the presence of the Val465 residue, which points into the active site, reducing its accessibility, could account for the low affinity of PBP5fm for beta-lactam. This loop is common to PBPs of low affinity, such as PBP2a from Staphylococcus aureus and PBP3 from Bacillus subtilis. Moreover, the insertion of a serine after residue 466 in the most resistant strains underlines even more the determining role of this loop in the recognition of the substrates.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Functional analysis of the lipoglycodepsipeptide antibiotic ramoplanin.
AB  - The peptide antibiotic ramoplanin is highly effective against several drug-resistant gram-positive bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), two important opportunistic human pathogens. Ramoplanin inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis by binding to Lipid intermediates I and II at a location different than the N-acyl-D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide site targeted by vancomycin. Lipid I/II capture physically occludes these substrates from proper utilization by the late-stage PG biosynthesis enzymes MurG and the transglycosylases. Key structural features of ramoplanin responsible for antibiotic activity and PG molecular recognition have been discovered by antibiotic semisynthetic modification in conjunction with NMR analyses. These results help define a minimalist ramoplanin pharmacophore and introduce the possibility of generating ramoplanin-derived peptide or peptidomimetic antibiotics for use against VRE, MRSA, and related pathogens.
TI  - Effect of medium composition on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to mercuric chloride.
AB  - Although there is considerable interest in identifying mercury-resistant bacteria, no standardized assay exists for this purpose. In this study, the effect of the composition of the medium on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to HgCl(2) was investigated. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of HgCl(2) for 52 streptococcal strains and the reproducibility of MIC values for Hg-sensitive and Hg-resistant strains was determined with 11 different media. Addition of blood increased the MIC values, and some media (tryptone soya agar, with or without blood) could not discriminate between Hg-sensitive and Hg-resistant strains. The proportion of streptococci that appeared to be resistant to Hg was very high (>70%) on some media (mitis-salivarius, tryptone soya, Columbia), but not on others (Mueller-Hinton, Brain Heart Infusion, Isosensitest). The MICs of the control strains varied considerably on different testing occasions for tryptone soya agar (with and without blood), Isosensitest agar, and Columbia agar (with blood). Mueller-Hinton (without blood) appeared to be the most suitable medium for isolating Hg-resistant oral streptococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (CUTIs) between 1988 and 2000. Imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting Gram-negative rods. Resistant strains (MIC>16 mg/l) were observed in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterococcus avium (8%), Serratia marcescens (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over the period. Resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. These results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - In vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and cefepime, alone and in combination with various antimicrobials, against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - Use of combinations of antimicrobials that together achieve synergistic activities against targeted microorganisms is one potential strategy for overcoming bacterial resistance. As the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci increases, the importance of devising additional synergistic drug combinations for these bacteria is magnified. We evaluated a number of antimicrobial combinations, with a focus on quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), cefepime, and linezolid, using a previously described in vitro pharmacodynamic model. The combination of Q-D with either linezolid or vancomycin, as well as the combination of cefepime-vancomycin, resulted in enhanced killing (> or =2-log(10) increase in killing versus the most-active single agent) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 494. An improved effect (<2 log(10) kill increase in kill) against MRSA 494 was noted for cefepime plus either Q-D or linezolid, as well as linezolid-vancomycin. Similar relationships were observed for a methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolate (isolate 1199). Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis R444, enhanced killing was achieved with the combination of cefepime-linezolid, while improvement was noted for vancomycin with either cefepime or linezolid. The combination of cefepime and vancomycin also achieved enhanced killing against a glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible S. aureus isolate (isolate 992). The combination of linezolid and doxycycline achieved an enhanced effect against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREFc) and E. faecium. Q-D plus ampicillin or linezolid resulted in similar enhancement of activity against the VREFc isolate. The results of this study suggest a number of novel antimicrobial combinations that may be useful against staphylococci and enterococci. Combination regimens including cefepime, Q-D, and/or linezolid warrant further investigation for the treatment of refractive infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Prevalence of and resistance to anti-microbial drugs in selected microbial species isolated from bulk milk samples.
AB  - The prevalence of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (CN) staphylococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, CN staphylococci from 63 samples, E. coli from 49 samples, E. faecalis or E. faecium from 107 samples, and L. monocytogenes from two samples. Bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. Sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (CLT), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (CMP), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ERY), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (STR), tetracycline (TTC) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) characteristics (MIC50, MIC90, MIC range) were determined for each microbial species. Resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of S. aureus, 40% of CN staphylococci, 73% of E. coli, 88% of E.faecalis, 55% of E.faecium, and one L. monocytogenes strain. Most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to STR, TTC, and ERY (MIC50 4 microg/ml). A high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. High resistance to CLT was found in 11 strains of E. coli (MIC 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to CMP (MIC90 16 microg/ml) were detected. The highest numbers of resistance phenotypes were found in E. coil (16) and CN staphylococci (12). Eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria (E. coli, E. faecalis, E. faecium) and pathogens (S. aureus, CN staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. The obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. This confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ERY or CMP. Our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.
TI  - In vitro activity of a novel oxazolidinone, AZD2563, against randomly selected and multiresistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of AZD2563, a novel oxazolidinone, was assessed against 595 Gram-positive cocci, comprising recent surveillance isolates and a collection of resistant (including multiresistant), epidemiologically diverse isolates. The MICs of AZD2563 for staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci had narrow ranges, 0.25-2 mg/L, with modal MICs of 1 mg/L for staphylococci and pneumococci, and 1-2 mg/L for enterococci. AZD2563 was equally active against the surveillance isolates and those that had been selected for their multiresistance to other agents. The MICs of AZD2563 were either the same as those of linezolid or two-fold lower.
TI  - Effect of growth phase and pH on the in vitro activity of a new glycopeptide, oritavancin (LY333328), against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Oritavancin (LY333328) is a novel glycopeptide with activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. We compared the effects of pH and growth phase on the activity of oritavancin and vancomycin against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. faecium. Killing curve methods were used to evaluate the effect of growth phase (stationary versus exponential) and pH (6.4, 7.4 and 8.0). An inoculum of 10(6) cfu/mL was used for all experiments. Growth phase of S. aureus and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium did not influence the rate and killing activity of oritavancin. The rate of killing by oritavancin against the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strain was significantly faster and the reduction in cfu/mL at 24 h was significantly greater when the organism was in exponential compared with stationary growth phase (P < 0.05). In exponential growth phase, time to 99.9% killing was achieved in 0.6 +/- 0.01 h for the vancomycin-resistant strain, whereas in stationary growth phase, oritavancin did not decrease the inoculum by 99.9% within 24 h. Oritavancin's activity against S. aureus and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium was not influenced by the pH conditions tested. Oritivancin's killing activity against the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strain was significantly enhanced when tested at pH 7.4 and 8.0 (P < 0.05). Our study has demonstrated that oritavancin's activity does not seem to be influenced by the growth phase of the organisms or the pH of the environment when tested against sensitive strains of S. aureus and E. faecium. However, oritavancin's activity might be reduced against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains in stationary growth phase, as seen in infective endocarditis or when organisms are exposed to an acidic environment.
TI  - Comparative activity of linezolid against staphylococci and enterococci isolated  in Italy.
AB  - The activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was tested against 862 Gram-positive cocci isolated in Italy and compared with the activities of 12 antibiotics. Overall, MIC90s for linezolid (2-4 mg/L) indicated an in vitro activity comparable to that of vancomycin in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4 mg/L), S. epidermidis (2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible strains. Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid (MIC90 2-4 mg/L), glycopeptides and beta-lactams. In E. faecium, only glycopeptides (MIC90 2 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC90 2 mg/L) were active. Linezolid was the only drug active against two strains of Enterococcus showing a VanA phenotype. Owing to its antibacterial profile, linezolid represents a promising drug for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Mimicry of host-defense peptides by unnatural oligomers: antimicrobial beta-peptides.
AB  - We have designed beta-amino acid oligomers that are helical, cationic, and amphiphilic with the intention of mimicking the biological activity of amphiphilic, cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides found in nature (e.g., magainins). We have previously identified a 17-residue beta-peptide (called beta-17) with antibiotic activity similar to that of a magainin derivative against four bacterial species, including two clinical isolates that are resistant to common antibiotics. This beta-peptide displays very low hemolytic activity against human red blood cells, which indicates selectivity for bacterial cells over mammalian cells. Here we examine some of the factors important for activity in this class of beta-peptides. An amphiphilic helix is necessary, because a nonamphiphilic isomer proved to be inactive. The ratio of cationic to hydrophobic residues is also important. Active beta-peptides induce the leakage of beta-galactosidase from treated Bacillus subtilis cells, as do alpha-helical antibiotic peptides, and this similarity suggests that the beta-peptide mode of action involves disruption of microbial membranes. This class of beta-peptides is not degraded by proteases, which bodes well for biological applications.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Clinical experience of quinupristin-dalfopristin for the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive infections.
AB  - Data regarding clinical administration, outcomes, and costs of quinupristin-dalfopristin treatment in 48 patients with serious gram-positive infections in a large teaching hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Thirty-six patients had vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infections, 10 had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) infections, and 2 were treated empirically Overall, 67% of the patients were clinically cured, and 56% had bacteriologic eradication; overall response rate was 48%. Patients with VREF bacteremia had the highest clinical cure (82%) and bacteriologic eradication (73%) rates. Mortality rate was 31%, but 6 of 15 patients who died were treated successfully with quinupristin-dalfopristin. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter among patients who lived versus those who died (p<0.05). Similarly, the mean hospital cost/patient was significantly lower in patients who lived than in those who died ($35,244 vs $122,922). Quinupristin-dalfopristin is effective in the treatment of both VREF and MRSA or MRSE infections in patients who fail to respond to, or are intolerant of, vancomycin.
TI  - A multicenter evaluation of linezolid antimicrobial activity in North America.
AB  - Overall, 141 centers in North America enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. Each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using Etests (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). Quality control testing was conducted using recommended strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was performed by a regional monitor. Of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the United States (US; n = 132) and Canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. Oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) isolates, respectively. Vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (MIC, > or =2 microg/ml). The MIC(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and CoNS isolates, and 4 microg/ml for S. aureus. Using the US FDA-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., MIC > or =8 microg/ml). The occurrence of linezolid MICs was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). Susceptibility to linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. Only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested Gram-positive specimens. The unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key Gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.
TI  - The role of glycopeptides in the treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections.
AB  - There is increasing concern over multiresistant staphylococcci in catheter-associated infections. Local infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci are usually resolved by removal of the intravascular catheter. However, if the device should remain for a certain period of time, e.g. to complete a course of chemotherapy, the antibiotic lock technique with a glycopeptide should be considered. In case of septic embolism to the lung caused by a multiresistant Staphylococccus aureus or Enterococcus faecium, systemic therapy with glycopeptides, streptogramins or linezolid must be employed.
TI  - Complexation of peptidoglycan intermediates by the lipoglycodepsipeptide antibiotic ramoplanin: minimal structural requirements for intermolecular complexation and fibril formation.
AB  - The peptide antibiotic ramoplanin inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis by interrupting late-stage membrane-associated glycosyltransferase reactions catalyzed by the transglycosylase and MurG enzymes. The mechanism of ramoplanin involves sequestration of lipid-anchored PG biosynthesis intermediates, physically occluding these substrates from proper utilization by these enzymes. In this report, we describe the first molecular-level details of the interaction of ramoplanin with PG biosynthesis intermediates. NMR analysis in conjunction with chemical dissection of the PG monomer revealed that the ramoplanin octapeptide D-Hpg-D-Orn-D-alloThr-Hpg-D-Hpg-alloThr-Phe-D-Orn recognizes MurNAc-Ala-gamma-D-Glu pyrophosphate, the minimum component of PG capable of high-affinity complexation and fibril formation. Ramoplanin therefore recognizes a PG binding locus different from the N-acyl-D-Ala-D-Ala moiety targeted by vancomycin. Because ramoplanin is structurally less complex than glycopeptide antibiotics such as vancomycin, peptidomimetic chemotherapeutics derived from this recognition sequence may find future use as antibiotics against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and related pathogens.
TI  - An Enterococcus faecalis ABC homologue (Lsa) is required for the resistance of this species to clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis isolates are resistant to clindamycin (CLI) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), and this is thought to be a species characteristic. Disruption of a gene (abc-23, now designated lsa, for "lincosamide and streptogramin A resistance") of E. faecalis was associated with a > or =40-fold decrease in MICs of Q-D (to 0.75 microg/ml), CLI (to 0.12 to 0.5 microg/ml), and dalfopristin (DAL) (to 4 to 8 microg/ml) for the wild-type E. faecalis parental strain (Q-D MIC, 32 microg/ml; CLI MIC, 32 to 48 microg/ml; DAL MIC, 512 microg/ml). Complementation of the disruption mutant with lsa on a shuttle plasmid resulted in restoration of the MICs of CLI, Q-D, and DAL to wild-type levels. Under high-stringency conditions, lsa was found in 180 of 180 isolates of E. faecalis but in none of 189 other enterococci. Among 19 erm(B)-lacking Enterococcus faecium strains, 9 (47%) were highly susceptible to CLI (MIC, 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml) and had DAL MICs of 4 to 16 microg/ml; for the remaining erm(B)-lacking E. faecium strains, the CLI and DAL MICs were 4 to > 256 and 2 to > 128 microg/ml, respectively. In contrast, none of 32 erm(B)-lacking E. faecalis strains were susceptible (CLI MIC range, 16 to 32 microg/ml; DAL MIC range, > or =32 microg/ml). When lsa was introduced into an E. faecium strain initially susceptible to CLI, the MICs of CLI and DAL increased > or =60-fold and that of Q-D increased 6-fold (to 3 to 6 microg/ml). Introduction of lsa into two DAL-resistant (MICs, > 128 microg/ml), Q-D-susceptible (MICs, 0.5 and 1.5 microg/ml) E. faecium strains (CLI MICs, 12 and >256 microg/ml) resulted in an increase in the Q-D MICs from 3- to 10-fold (to 8 and >32 microg/ml), respectively. Although efflux was not studied, the similarity (41 to 64%) of the predicted Lsa protein to ABC proteins such as Vga(A), Vga(B), and Msr(A) of Staphylococcus aureus and YjcA of Lactococcus lactis and the presence of Walker A and B ATP-binding motifs suggest that this resistance may be related to efflux of these antibiotics. In conclusion, lsa appears to be an intrinsic gene of E. faecalis that explains the characteristic resistance of this species to CLI and Q-D.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, RWJ-54428, against streptococci, enterococci and staphylococci, including glycopeptide-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The need for new antimicrobial agents with activity against Gram-positive organisms has become increasingly important because of emerging resistance. We compared the activity of a new b-lactam antimicrobial agent, RWJ-54428 (MC-02 479), with representatives of other classes of antimicrobial agents against 76 Staphylococcus aureus (including four glycopeptide- intermediate strains), 50 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 20 Enterococcus faecalis, 20 Enterococcus faecium, 10 Enterococcus gallinarum/Enterococcus casseliflavus, 54 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 22 viridans streptococcal isolates. The MIC(90) of RWJ-54,428 was < or = 2 mg/L for all groups of bacteria tested except E. faecium. The activity against four strains of glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus was similar to that for other methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (range 0.5-2.0 mg/L).
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance: a population perspective.
AB  - The need to stem the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has prompted multiple, sometimes conflicting, calls for changes in the use of antimicrobial agents. One source of disagreement concerns the major mechanisms by which antibiotics select resistant strains. For infections like tuberculosis, in which resistance can emerge in treated hosts through mutation, prevention of antimicrobial resistance in individual hosts is a primary method of preventing the spread of resistant organisms in the community. By contrast, for many other important resistant pathogens, such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium resistance is mediated by the acquisition of genes or gene fragments by horizontal transfer; resistance in the treated host is a relatively rare event. For these organisms, indirect, population-level mechanisms of selection account for the increase in the prevalence of resistance. These mechanisms can operate even when treatment has a modest, or even negative, effect on an individual host's colonization with resistant organisms.
TI  - [New treatment option for gram-positive infections in critically ill patients - overview over linezolid].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the last decade, there has been an emergence of multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria in intensive care units. Oxazolidinones are a new class of antibiotics without cross-resistance to other antimicrobial agents, and linezolid was recently introduced as first oxazolidinone on the German market. In this overview, we summarize important data and discuss possible indications for linezolid in the treatment of infections in critically ill patients. ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY AND PHARMACOLOGY: The antimicrobial spectrum comprises mainly Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci. Linezolid is mostly bacteriostatic and inhibits the bacterial protein synthesis at an early stage. Adults may receive 600 mg b.i.d. intravenously or p. o. About 30 % of the dose are excreted by the kidneys as mother compound and 50 % as metabolites. Dosage reductions are not necessary, even in severe renal impairment, but about one third of the dose is eliminated during dialysis. Overall, linezolid is well tolerated, but approximately 5 % of the patients may suffer from diarrhea or nausea and there have been a few reports about reversible myelosuppressive side effects. CLINICAL STUDIES: Linezolid has been compared to vancomycin for treatment of Gram-positive nosocomial pneumonia, and the clinical cure rates were 66.4 % and 68.1 %, respectively. Linezolid is highly active and bactericidal against pneumococci. The clinical cure rates for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections were 88.1 % with linezolid and 86.1 % with penicillinase-stable penicillins. MRSA were excluded in this study, but it may be assumed from data in vitro that linezolid is equally effective against these bacteria. Data for the treatment of catheter-associated and other forms of bacteremias are mainly derived from the compassionate-use-program, where linezolid has been used in complicated cases, mainly after failure of standard therapy. The majority of infections was caused by multiresistant Enterococcus faecium and the clinical cure rates were approximately 80 %. COMMENT: The currently available data suggest that linezolid will serve as useful agent in the treatment of severe infections caused by multiresistant staphylococci and enterococci. Further studies are necessary to define the role of linezolid as first-line agent, e. g. in the treatment of central venous catheter infections. In light of the severe prognosis of pneumonias caused by MRSA, studies on the combination of linezolid and vancomycin are warranted. Despite the low level of resistance, it seems prudent not to use linezolid as first line agent in the treatment of uncomplicated infections, as long as effective standard antibiotics are available.
TI  - Proficiency of Italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in Enterococcus and Staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout Italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and VanA-, VanB- or VanC-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. METHODS: Eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (S. aureus ATCC 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate S. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683Y]) and five enterococci (E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecalis ATCC 51299 VanB, E. faecium AIB40 VanA, E. faecalis V583 VanB and E. gallinarum AIB39 VanC1) were distributed to 59 Italian clinical microbiology laboratories. Each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. Results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. In addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. RESULTS: All 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. A total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. Overall, laboratories were able to identify isolates to the genus level successfully. E. gallinarum and S. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. For enterococcal test strains, VanA phenotypes were detected correctly by 96.6% of laboratories; VanB by 30.5% (E. faecalis ATCC 51299) and 88.1% (E. faecalis V583); and VanC1 by 67.8%. For staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (S. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (S. haemolyticus 10030683Y) of the laboratories were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in VanB and VanC1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. For staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and Vitek (software version 5.04) users. Overall, considerably fewer errors occurred with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. For 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of E. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of E. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of S. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying E. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. While VanA phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting VanB and VanC phenotypes. The majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older Vitek systems. Teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. Should enterococcal VanB or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in Italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. New systems under development, such as Vitek2, should improve this situation.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial spectrum and activity of BMS284756 (T-3811; a desfluoroquinolone) tested against an international collection of staphylococci and enterococci, including in vitro test development and intermethod comparisons.
AB  - The study was initiated to determine the in vitro activity and MIC/disk test comparisons of BMS284756, a new des-fluoro(6)-quinolone, against isolates of staphylococci and enterococci from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 2000. Isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. Against 3,789 strains of gram-positive cocci from the SENTRY Program (2000), the BMS284756 MIC90 and percentage susceptible at < or = 2 and < or = 4 microg/ml were: Staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml; 89.3 and 97.1%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 4 microg/ml; 86.1 and 96.0%) and enterococci (> 4 microg/ml; 62.0 and 76.2%). Also tested were selected staphylococci (300 strains) and enterococci (102 strains) by two standardized methods. The activity of BMS284756 was highly correlated with oxacillin resistance among staphylococci. Oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were all inhibited by BMS284756 at < or = 0.5 microg/ml, whereas oxacillin-resistant strains required inhibitory concentrations of > or = 1 microg/ml. Excellent correlation was observed between the MIC and 5-microg disk zone diameter for staphylococci and enterococci (r=0.91 to 0.93). Among vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, 67% of Enterococcus faecalis, 25% of E. faecium, and 76% of other Enterococcus spp. isolates were inhibited by BMS284756 at < or = 2 microg/ml. All vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; 11 E. faecalis and 15 E. faecium) were inhibited by > or = 2 microg/ml of BMS284756. Among the non-VRE, non-faecium enterococcal isolates (n=64), 62% were inhibited by < or = 0.5 microg/ml. BMS284756 showed excellent activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and moderate activity against enterococci other than VRE and E. faecium. Acceptable correlations were observed between MIC and disk test results for both tested genus groups.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, HMR 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. METHODS: The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The postantibiotic effects of HMR 3004 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. RESULTS: The time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3004 exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by HMR 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of DQ-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-113, formerly D61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (MIC90s) of DQ-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a MIC90 of 0.25microg/ml. DQ-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and DQ-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MIC90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, DQ-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a MIC range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. DQ-113 also showed a potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.03 microg/ml). The activity of DQ-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The MICs of DQ-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. From these results, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline (GAR-936) against recently isolated clinical bacteria in Spain.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of tigecycline (GAR-936) were compared with those of other agents against 1,087 strains recently isolated in 12 Spanish medical centers. Tigecycline showed activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic DNA amplification.
AB  - In this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices) were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. The tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. Classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus. Both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of Bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of Bacillus pumilus, 3 isolates of Enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of Enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates of Escherichia coli, 8 isolates of Lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 62 distinct RAPD types were categorized from the five genera studied. Typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in three patient pairs. Genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.
TI  - Multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in Taiwan.
AB  - A susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from March, 2000, to June, 2000, in Taiwan. This study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), Enterobacter cloacae (57%), Serratia marcescens (34%), and Citrobacter freundii (60%). High rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for P. aeruginosa (15%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. The percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (42%), Enterococcus faecium (71%), and ORSA (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. The resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of ICUs. Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in ICU settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in ICU patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - Present situation of antimicrobial resistance in Korea.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. In Korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, class C beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in Korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. Recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa present new threats in Korea.
TI  - Microbial killing activity of peracetic acid.
AB  - In vitro killing activity of peracetic acid (Perasafe) at a concentration of 0.26 per cent w/v was tested against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Acinetobacter baumannii, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis spore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immuno-deficiency virus type I. Exposure to Peracetic acid (0.26% w/v) for 10 minutes resulted in massive killing of all the aforementioned organisms and spore.
TI  - In vitro activity of cephalosporin RWJ-54428 (MC-02479) against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02479) is a novel cephalosporin that binds to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) PBP 2' (PBP 2a) of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Its in vitro activity was assessed against 472 gram-positive cocci, largely selected as epidemiologically unrelated isolates with multidrug resistance. The MIC at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)) and MIC(90) of RWJ-54428 for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively, whereas they were 0.5 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), whereas they were 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible isolates. The highest MICs for MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were 2 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of RWJ-54428 for Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, but they were 4 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, for Enterococcus faecium. For penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant pneumococci, the MIC(90)s of RWJ-54428 were 0.03, 0.25, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, with the highest MIC for a pneumococcus being 1 microg/ml, recorded for a strain for which penicillin and cefotaxime MICs were 8 and 4 microg/ml. MICs for Lancefield group A, B, C, and G streptococci were < or =0.008 microg/ml; those for viridans group streptococci, including isolates not susceptible to penicillin, were from 0.015 to 0.5 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 did not select resistant mutants of MRSA or enterococci in challenge experiments and has the potential to be useful for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Pestalone, a new antibiotic produced by a marine fungus in response to bacterial  challenge.
AB  - The isolation and structure determination of a new chlorinated benzophenone antibiotic, pestalone (1), is described. The new compound was produced by a cultured marine fungus only when a unicellular marine bacterium, strain CNJ-328, was co-cultured in the fungal fermentation. The fungus, isolated from the surface of the brown alga Rosenvingea sp. collected in the Bahamas Islands, was identified as an undescribed member of the genus Pestalotia. The structure of 1, initially assigned with only modest confidence by combined spectral and chemical data, was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Pestalone (1) exhibits moderate in vitro cytotoxicity in the National Cancer Institute's 60 human tumor cell line screen (mean GI(50) = 6.0 microM). More importantly, pestalone shows potent antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 37 ng/mL) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (MIC = 78 ng/mL), indicating that pestalone should be evaluated in advanced models of infectious disease.
TI  - In vitro activities of a new ketolide, ABT-773, against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ABT-773 were evaluated against 324 strains of gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. ABT-773 had lower MIC ranges, MICs at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)s), and MIC(90)s than erythromycin or clindamycin for almost all isolates tested. The MICs of ABT-773 were also lower than those of quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp., while the MICs of Q-D were lower than those of ABT-773 for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant isolates.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of acylides (3-O-acyl-erythromycin derivatives): a novel class of macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - Introduction of an acyl group to the 3-O-position of erythromycin A derivatives instead of L-cladinose led to a novel class of macrolide antibiotics that we named "acylides". The 3-O-nitrophenylacetyl derivative TEA0777 showed significantly potent activity against not only erythromycin-susceptible Gram-positive pathogens but also inducibly macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS(B))-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and efflux-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. These results indicated that acylides have potential as next-generation macrolide antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of chloroxylenol and chlorhexidine in the treatment of infected root canals.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of a chlorhexidine gluconate (2.0%) and of an ethanolic chloroxylenol solution (10%) as a temporary root canal dressing against selected test microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracted single-rooted human teeth were instrumented up to size 40. After removal of the smear layer suspensions of the test microorganisms were inserted into the root canals. After incubation for 48 hrs each suspension of the test organisms was removed and the root canals were filled with one of the two different disinfectants. The teeth were then incubated for 48 hrs. Twelve teeth and three controls were used for each of the four test organisms and each of the two regimens. After incubation, each root canal was instrumented and the removed canal wall dentin was examined microbiologically. RESULTS: With a contact time of 48 hrs between the two disinfectants and the four bacterial suspensions the medications led to a total killing of microorganisms in 82% of a total of 96 contaminated teeth. In the dentin layer situated 50 microm from the root canal, both medications achieved bacterial killing in a range from 99.9% to 99.99%, depending on the test organism. There were no significant differences (P> 0.1) between the relative antimicrobial activity of the two root canal dressings.
TI  - Clinical experience with linezolid in the treatment of resistant gram-positive infections.
AB  - This study presents our clinical experience with linezolid in 19 patients with serious resistant gram-positive infections enrolled as part of the compassionate study. In this prospective, non-randomized, noncomparative study, 19 patients were enrolled as part of the National Compassionate Study Protocol conducted by Pharmacia-Upjohn. At the time of this writing, these patients had not been published in the literature. All of the patients had to have documented evidence of serious gram-positive infections in normally sterile sites and should have been unable to tolerate available antimicrobial therapy or be unresponsive to available drugs. Clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were obtained. Patients were followed both short-term and long-term after completion of therapy. Nineteen patients were enrolled: 13 females and 6 males. The average age was 63 years. The average length of therapy with linezolid was 22 days. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was treated in eight patients, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in two patients, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) in eight patients, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in two patients. Co-infecting organisms include Enterococcus species colonization in six patients, Pseudomonas species in one patient, Serratia marcenens in one patient, and Candida albicans in one patient. Sterile sites that were infected included bone and joint (wounds and septic joints) in six patients, gastrointestinal system (hepatobiliary, liver abscess, Crohn's) in five patients, genitourinary (kidney and urine) in two patients, blood in five patients, respiratory in one patient, and aortic valve in 1 patient. Linezolid was given at 600 mg IV every 12 hours with a mean length of therapy of 22 days. Surgical drainage was used in combination with linezolid in 11 of the patients. Seventy nine percent of these patients achieved clinical and microbiologic cure, and none of the deaths reported in this series were related to the drug. Adverse events included skin rash in one patient, mild bone marrow suppression in two patients, and mild elevation in liver function tests in two patients. No life-threatening adverse events were noted. It appears that linezolid, along with surgical intervention (when necessary), appears to be an effective treatment option for resistant gram-positive infections. Long-term studies evaluating the possible resistance rates are necessary.
TI  - Linezolid: pharmacokinetic characteristics and clinical studies.
AB  - Linezolid is an oxazolidinone indicated in the treatment of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus infections. The drug is also approved for use in complicated skin infections and nosocomial pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, concurrent bacteremia associated with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and concurrent bacteremia associated with community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - The DUEL study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the Netherlands.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the Netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. METHODS: Bacterial strains were isolated between September 1999 and January 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. The in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were obtained with the E test on Mueller-Hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. For vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 McFarland was used for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant colonies. RESULTS: The values of MIC90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. Six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as Enterococcus faecium, E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vanA, vanC1 and vanC2/3 genes, respectively. Nine per cent of Streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermB and mefE type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. Twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: Linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive cocci. Cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against Gram-positive uropathogens of hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of linezolid, a recently developed antibiotic agent active against Gram-positive bacteria, was tested against pathogens from three different collections. (1) Uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients (1990/1991) with complicated and/or hospital-acquired UTIs; Urologic Clinic, Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. (2) Uropathogens from a multi-centre study (1995/1996) comprising 37 urological centres throughout Germany. (3) MRSA isolates of patients and staff (1999/2000) within the Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. Genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of linezolid determined by an agar (Isosensitest) dilution method using a multipoint inoculator and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point ranged for methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n=27) between 2 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (n=35) between 1 and 2 mg/l, for methicillin susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (MSSE) (n=67) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant CNS (MRSE) (n=19) between 0.25 and 2 mg/l, for Enterococcus. faecalis (n=184) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for E. faecium (n=3) 2 mg/l and for Streptococcus spp. (n=4) between 0.25 and 1 mg/l, indicating that all strains were susceptible. According to the in vitro activity, linezolid may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated UTI caused by Gram-positive uropathogens. Thus, linezolid should be evaluated in a clinical study.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Validation of the sterilization procedure of allogeneic avital bone transplants using peracetic acid-ethanol.
AB  - Different procedures are available to inactivate bacteria and fungi, including their spores, as well as viruses in human bone transplants. The most efficient methods are considered to be gamma irradiation and thermal inactivation as well as chemical sterilization methods like the peracetic acid-ethanol treatment (PES). Following national and international standards or draft standards, the antimicrobial effectiveness of this procedure was evaluated. Due to the standardizable size as well as the clinical relevance, defatted human spongiosa cuboids (15x15x15 mm) served as model system. After treatment with PES for 2 and 4 hours, respectively, the titre of living micro-organisms was determined in the supernatant and the cuboid. A reduction in the titre of viable micro-organisms below the detection level (reduction factor >5 log10) was already achieved after an incubation time of 2 hours (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium sporogenes, Mycobacterium terrae, Candida albicans as well as spores of Bacillus subtilis). No viable micro-organisms could be detected in any of the PES-treated test cuboids. Spores of Aspergillus niger were also completely inactivated. The PES procedure proved to be a reliable method for the sterilization of human bone transplants derived from spongiosa.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of vancomycin dimers with potent activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria: target-accelerated combinatorial synthesis.
AB  - Based on the notion that dimerization and/or variation of amino acid 1 of vancomycin could potentially enhance biological activity, a series of synthetic and chemical biology studies were undertaken in order to discover potent antibacterial agents. Herein we describe two ligation methods (disulfide formation and olefin metathesis) for dimerizing vancomycin derivatives and applications of target-accelerated combinatorial synthesis (e.g. combinatorial synthesis in the presence of vancomycin's target Ac2-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala) to generate libraries of vancomycin dimers. Screening of these compound libraries led to the identification of a number of highly potent antibiotics effective against vancomycin-suspectible, vancomycin-intermediate resistant and, most significantly, vancomycin-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Solid- and solution-phase synthesis of vancomycin and vancomycin analogues with activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Vancomycin, the prototypical member of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics, is a clinically used antibiotic employed against a variety of drug-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The recent emergence of vancomycin resistance, viewed as a growing threat to public health, prompted us to initiate a program aimed at restoring the potency of this important antibiotic through chemical manipulation of the vancomycin structure. Herein, we describe the development of synthetic technology based on the design of a novel selenium safety catch linker, application of this technology to a solid-phase semisynthesis of vancomycin, and the solid- and solution-phase synthesis of vancomycin libraries. Biological evaluation of these compound libraries led to the identification of a number of in vitro highly potent antibacterial agents effective against vancomycin-resistant bacteria. In addition to aiding these investigations, the solid-phase chemistry described herein is expected to enhance the power of combinatorial chemistry and facilitate chemical biology and medicinal chemistry studies.
TI  - An in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, E coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group B Streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/mL of gentamicin and toward E coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/mL of gentamicin. CONCLUSION: A low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
TI  - A simple model host for identifying Gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  - We demonstrate the use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several Gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, or Streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult C. elegans. Focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both E. faecalis and E. faecium kill C. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only E. faecalis kills the adults. In the case of adults, a low inoculum of E. faecalis grows to a high titer in the C. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on E. faecium. Interestingly, a high titer of E. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. Two E. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. We exploit the apparent parallels between Gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an E. faecalis virulence factor, ScrB, which is relevant to mammalian pathogenesis.
TI  - Selective cleavage of D-Ala-D-Lac by small molecules: re-sensitizing resistant bacteria to vancomycin.
AB  - Pathogenic enterococci are becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, the drug of last resort for Gram-positive infections. Enterococci pose a significant public health threat, not least because of the risk of transferring vancomycin resistance to the ubiquitous Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin resistance is manifested by cell wall peptidoglycan precursors with altered termini that cannot bind the antibiotic. Small molecules with well-oriented nucleophile-electrophile assembly and complementary chirality to the peptidoglycan termini were identified as catalytic and selective cleavers of the peptidoglycan precursor depsipeptide. These molecules were tested in combination with vancomycin and were found to re-sensitize vancomycin-resistant bacteria to the antibiotic.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Biological and mechanistic activities of xanthorrizol and 4-(1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2-methylphenol isolated from Iostephane heterophylla.
AB  - Xanthorrizol (1) and 4-(1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2-methylphenol (2) were identified as the principal antimicrobial components of a CH(2)Cl(2)-MeOH (1:1) extract derived from Iostephane heterophylla. Compound 2 is a new natural product, but has been synthesized. Both compounds exhibited low level activity (MICs of 16-32 microg/mL) against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. They were either inactive or poorly active against Gram-negative bacteria and yeast. Mechanistic studies performed in Escherichia coli imp suggested nonspecific inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis by both of these compounds. Compound 1 was tested in an in vivo model; it did not provide protection to mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Multi-laboratory assessment of the linezolid spectrum of activity using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method: Report of the Zyvox Antimicrobial Potency Study (ZAPS) in the United States.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid against common Gram-positive pathogens was compared to that of penicillin or ampicillin or oxacillin (depending upon genus), cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and vancomycin by disk diffusion methods. One hundred and six centers (31 states in US) tested recent clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other streptococci. Testing was conducted using the standardized disk diffusion method and concurrent quality control testing was performed. Strains with linezolid zone diameters of < or = 20 mm were requested for referral to the microbiology monitor for confirmation. A total of 3,100 isolates (97% compliance) were tested. Susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 21 mm) of staphylococci and streptococci to linezolid was reported in 100% and 99.4% of staphylococci and streptococci, respectively. Susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 23 mm) of enterococci to linezolid was 96.0% with only three isolates (0.4%) reported as resistant (zone diameters, < or = 20 mm; unconfirmed). Among a total of nine isolates (0.3%) reported to have zone diameters 20 mm, six were not submitted for further testing, two were contaminated with Gram-negative bacilli and one was determined to be linezolid-susceptible. There were no differences in linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin- or oxacillin- or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains. This susceptibility pattern for US medical centers is indicative of the excellent and nearly complete in vitro activity against the key Gram-positive pathogens for which linezolid has received US Food and Drug Administration indications for clinical use.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antimicrobial activity of a new carbapenem, E1010, and tentative disc diffusion test interpretative criteria.
AB  - The susceptibility of 705 bacterial isolates representing 46 different species to E1010 (ER-35786), imipenem, meropenem and cefepime was determined by the NCCLS broth microdilution test. The MIC(90)s for E1010 were < or =1.0 mg/L for Enterobacteriaceae, fastidious Gram-negative bacteria, streptococci and anaerobes. E1010 was two- to four-fold more active than imipenem and meropenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four-fold more active than the other carbapenems against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci and most Enterococcus faecium were resistant to all four drugs tested. The NCCLS disc diffusion test was performed simultaneously on the non-fastidious organisms. Assuming the MIC breakpoints for E1010 will be the same as for the other carbapenems, the disc diffusion zone diameter breakpoints of imipenem and meropenem would also be applicable to E1010.
TI  - Post-antibiotic growth suppression of linezolid against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) of eight different concentrations of  linezolid against Gram-positive cocci were investigated and the results analysed using the sigmoid E(max) model for mathematically modelling the PAE. Mean maximal linezolid PAEs against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 2.2, 1.8, 2.8, 2.0 and 3.0 h, respectively. Resistance to methicillin (for the staphylococci), vancomycin (for the enterococci) and penicillin (for the pneumococci) had no effect on the duration of the PAE. Results of PAE testing support twice-daily dosing of linezolid in humans.
TI  - Antagonistic effect of enterocin CCM 4231 from Enterococcus faecium on "bryndza", a traditional Slovak dairy product from sheep milk.
AB  - "Bryndza" is a traditional Slovak dairy product (type of soft cheese) made from sheep cheese which was ripened for 14 days. Because its manufacture, transporting and/or storing represent conditions which facilitate contamination, the effect of enterocin CCM4231 in "bryndza" was investigated with the aim to reduce the contaminant agents. "Bryndza" was divided into equal portions (50 g). The experimental sample (ES) as well as the control sample one (C1) were inoculated with Listeria innocua Li1 strain. The other control samples C2 and C3 were without Li1 strain. C3 control was selected as a reference control. ES and C2 portions were treated with purified enterocin CCM4231 in a concentration of 6400 AU/ml. Before the experimental inoculation, "bryndza" was checked for the presence of contaminant agents. The experiment lasted 1 week and the samples were stored in the refrigerator at 4 degrees C. Sampling was performed on day 1, on day 4 and on day 7. The control samples C2 and C3 were checked only on day 1 and then after 1 week. The following contaminant agents were detected in "bryndza" before its experimental inoculation with L. innocua Li1 strain: Escherichia coli in the amount 10(3) cfu/ml/g, Staphylococcus aureus (10(2) cfu/ml/g) and enterococci (10(4) cfu/ml/g). In the control sample C2, the number of E. coli was reduced to 10(2) cfu/ml/g. Enterococci and staphylococci were totally eliminated there. Concerning C3 control, natural decrease of bacteria was found and/or their unchanged counts. The value of pH (5) was stable during the whole experiment. In the experimental sample inoculated with Li1 strain, its counts were decreased immediately after enterocin CCM4231 addition approximately by one order of magnitude. This inhibitory effect was also detectable on day 4 by the difference of one order of magnitude between ES and C1. On day 7, 10(3) cfu/ml/g of Li1 strain were detected in both samples (ES, C1). The difference by one order of magnitude indicated, an inhibitory effect of enterocin CCM4231 in "bryndza". However, bacteriocin activity was not determined by laboratory analyses.
TI  - The relationship of a clonal outbreak of Enterococcus faecium vanA to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus incidence in an Australian hospital.
AB  - Australian isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have been widely scattered geographically, predominantly polyclonal and of the VanB phenotype. Forty-nine VRE were isolated from 47 patients in our hospital from October 1996 to December 1999. Forty-four of these VRE were Enterococcus faecium with a vanA glycopeptide resistance genotype. Four isolates were pathogenic. Thirty-five VRE were from an outbreak in the Renal and Infectious Diseases Units over a four-month period. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) demonstrated that 41 of the 49 VRE were indistinguishable or closely related. Enhanced environmental cleaning, strict contact isolation of colonized patients and reducing inpatient admissions terminated the epidemic. Cohorting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-positive patients was restricted because VRE patients occupied the isolation facilities. This resulted in a statistically significant increase in MRSA infections across the hospital. VRE epidemics have the ability to influence the epidemiology of other nosocomial pathogens when infection control resources are exhausted.
TI  - Resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  - We studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. No spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for Staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for Staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for Streptococcus pneumoniae). Population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. Assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. Stable S. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. The daptomycin MICs for these isolates were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. Many mutants with high MICs (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of S. aureus small colony variants. The voltage component (Delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. In vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. For other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. These results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.
TI  - Distribution of aminoglycoside resistance genes in recent clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium.
AB  - Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs) are major factors which confer aminoglycoside resistance on bacteria. Distribution of genes encoding seven AMEs was investigated by multiplex PCR for 279 recent clinical isolates of enterococci derived from a university hospital in Japan. The aac(6')-aph(2"), which is related to high level gentamicin resistance, was detected at higher frequency in Enterococcus faecalis (42.5%) than in Enterococcus faecium (4.3%). Almost half of E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates possessed ant(6)-Ia and aph(3')-IIIa. The profile of AME gene(s) detected most frequently in individual strains of E. faecalis was aac(6')aph(2") + ant(6)-Ia + aph(3')-IIIa, and isolates with this profile showed high level resistance to both gentamicin and streptomycin. In contrast, AME gene profiles of aac(6')-Ii+ ant(6)-Ia+aph(3')-IIIa, followed by aac(6')-Ii alone, were predominant in E. faecium. Only one AME gene profile of ant(6)-Ia+aph(3')-IIIa was found in Enterococcus avium. The ant(4')-Ia and ant(9)-Ia, which have been known to be distributed mostly among Staphylococcus aureus strains, were detected in a few enterococcal strains. An AME gene aph(2")-Ic was not detected in any isolates of the three enterococcal species. These findings indicated a variety of distribution profiles of AME genes among enterococci in our study site.
TI  - Linezolid for the treatment of resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive review of linezolid, the first of a new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones. Therapeutic issues regarding the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and a brief history of the oxazolidinones are also discussed. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1966-March 2001) was conducted to identify pertinent literature, including preclinical trials, clinical trials, and reviews. Unpublished clinical data, adverse effects, and dosing information were abstracted from product labeling. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical efficacy data were extracted from clinical trials, case reports, and abstracts that mentioned linezolid. Additional information concerning antibiotic resistance, the oxazolidinones, in vitro susceptibility and the pharmacokinetic profile of linezolid also was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Linezolid exhibits activity against many gram-positive organisms, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at an early step in translation and is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of unpublished clinical trials in adults with pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections. The adverse effect profile is similar to that of comparator agents (beta-lactams, clarithrornycin, vancomycin). CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid is the first oral antimicrobial agent approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Since the oxazoildinones have a unique mechanism of action and expanded spectrum of activity against virulent and highly resistant gram positive pathogens, linezolid is a valuable alternative to currently available treatment options. Clinical trials evaluating linezolid and other oxazolidinones for antibiotic-resistant gram-positive infections, as well as comparator studies comparing linezolid with other candidate drugs, such as quinupristin/dalfopristin and choramphenicol, will further define the role of linezolid.
TI  - Successful administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the outpatient setting.
AB  - Intravenous administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin outside the hospital setting has not been reported previously. We describe 37 outpatients receiving quinupristin/dalfopristin iv for infections including osteomyelitis, bacteraemia, abscesses and cellulitis. The most frequent aetiological pathogens found were Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Patients received an average of 9 days therapy as inpatients and 22 days as outpatients. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was administered using various access devices, most commonly peripherally inserted central catheters and tunnelled central catheters. The bacteriological and clinical success rates were both 89.2%. Five patients were readmitted to hospital; one patient developed catheter-related bacteraemia. The most frequently reported non-venous adverse events were nausea (18.9% of patients), myalgia (18.9%) and arthralgia (13.5%). Sixteen patients experienced venous access-related events, most commonly infusion pain, oedema and phlebitis. In this group of patients, for those who had difficult-to-treat infections, intravenous quinupristin/dalfopristin therapy was generally effective and safe outside the hospital setting.
TI  - Screening of some plants from Northern Argentina for their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - AIMS: Screening of antimicrobial activity in 25 plant species from Northern Argentina. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inhibition of microbial growth was measured by a microplate assay with an oxidation-reduction indicator (Alamar Blue). Test organisms were: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Weak inhibitory activities (MIC=0.5 mg dry matter ml(-1)) were found in methanolic extracts of Rivina humilis, Crateva tapia, Funastrum claucum and Schinopsis balansae. Stronger bacteriostatic power was detected in Vassobia breviflora (MIC=0.25 mg ml(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus, and 0.5 mg ml(-1) against Enterococcus faecium). This activity was purified five-fold by extraction with dichloromethane, and it was found equally effective against susceptible or antibiotic-resistant strains of Staph. aureus. In addition, the purified extract was synergistic with gentamicin, and it was bactericidal at 24 h, with a concentration of 0.25 mg ml(-1). CONCLUSION: There is a significant antimicrobial activity in Vassobia breviflora. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Further studies will be required to disclose the potential importance of these findings.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - Linezolid: an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is the first oxazolidinone anti-infective agent marketed in the United States. It is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other susceptible organisms, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. It also is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of linezolid. METHODS: Using the terms linezolid, PNU-100766, and oxazolidinone, we performed a literature search of the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to September 2000), HealthSTAR (1993 to September 2000), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966 to September 2000), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to September 2000), PharmaProjects (January 2000 version), and meeting abstracts of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1996 to 2000). RESULTS: Linezolid has a unique structure and mechanism of action, which targets protein synthesis at an exceedingly early stage. Consequently, cross-resistance with other commercially available antimicrobial agents is unlikely. It is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. To date, resistance to linezolid has been reported in patients infected with enterococci. The pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults are not altered by hepatic or renal function, age, or sex to an extent requiring dose adjustment. Linezolid is metabolized via morpholine ring oxidation, which is independent of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system; as a result, linezolid is unlikely to interact with medications that stimulate or inhibit CYP450 enzymes. Compassionate-use trials and other clinical studies involving mainly adult hospitalized patients with gram-positive infections have shown that linezolid administered intravenously or orally is effective in a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including those caused by resistant gram-positive organisms. Reported adverse effects include thrombocytopenia. diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation, rash, and dizziness. Preliminary pharmacoeconomic data indicate that a significantly higher percentage of patients receiving linezolid therapy versus comparator could be discharged from the hospital by day 7 (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid appears to be effective while maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. Due to the risk of bacterial resistance, linezolid should be reserved for the treatment of documented serious vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - Antimicrobial management strategies for Gram-positive bacterial resistance in the intensive care unit.
AB  - This article summarizes the current situation with Gram-positive infections, including the two primary consequences-failure to cure and resistance-relevant to the intensive care unit. The past few years have seen Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin increase from 10% of strains to approaching 60% of strains in some centers. Failure is now so frequent that vancomycin can no longer be safely used. This has lead to use of two new antibiotics, quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid), first marketed in the United States in September 1999, and linezolid (Zyvox), which reached the U.S. market in May 2000. Both of these agents are being used to treat culture-proven vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. The calculated areas under the inhibitory curve (AUIC) values of vancomycin, even when its minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is 4.0 microg/mL, show almost all vancomycin-resistant E. faecium have AUICs <125. This explains failure, as well as the further selection of this bacteria into subpopulations with progressively higher MICs. Less well defined, but potentially an even greater problem, is the poor efficacy of vancomycin against multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus. Here, there is evidence of clinical failure in lower respiratory tract infection patients, but in most cases the MIC values of the organism have not risen to the point where AUICs are <125. However, the minimum bactericidal concentration of this organism may be considerably higher than its MIC, and in other cases there may be a high inoculum effect or a protein-binding effect to explain the failure of vancomycin to kill multiresistant S. aureus. Besides the increasing use of the new agents, strategies to manage these two increasingly resistant Gram-positive infections include cephalosporin restriction, switch and streamlining when cultures come back from the lab, combination regimens, and cycling in selected intensive care units.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of quinupristin/dalfopristin tested against gram-positive cocci from Latin America: results from the global SMART (GSMART) surveillance study.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci are important causes of both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, and antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens has become an important problem worldwide. Since resistance among these organisms can vary substantially by geographic location, we conducted a multicenter surveillance study with isolates from five Latin American countries (15 medical centers). Quinupristin/dalfopristin (formerly RP-59500) is a novel streptogramin combination with focused activity against Gram-positive cocci, many exhibiting emerging resistance. The in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and 12 other antimicrobial agents were evaluated against 1,948 strains including Staphylococcus aureus (747 strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS;446 strains), enterococci (429 strains), and various Streptococcus spp. (326 strains). Oxacillin resistance was observed in 41% of S. aureus (MIC, <e; 2 microg/ml or >e; 13 mm) and 40% of CoNS (MIC, <e; 0.25 microg/ml or >e; 18 mm). Vancomycin, teicoplanin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90), 0.25 - 1 mg/ml) remained effective against all strains, but cross-resistance was high among other tested drugs. The quinupristin/dalfopristin MIC(50) for Streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci was only 0.5 mg/ml (13% to 28% were penicillin-resistant; 12% to 22% were macrolide-resistant). Enterococci demonstrated variable inhibition by quinupristin/dalfopristin depending upon identification and the susceptibility testing method used. The demonstrated quinupristin/dalfopristin activity against Enterococcus faecium was confirmed, but potential species identification errors with various commercial systems continue to confuse susceptibility statistics, even though some strains of E. faecium confirmed by PCR-based or other molecular identification techniques did have quinupristin/dalfopristin MICs of >e; 4 microg/ml. Most important, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci are rapidly emerging in Latin America, and quinupristin/dalfopristin appears active against many of these isolates as well as having potency against nearly all staphylococci and streptococci tested at <e; 2 microg/ml or having a zone diameter of >e; 16 mm. Comparisons to GSMART results from other continents show nearly identical quinupristin/dalfopristin activity for each Gram-positive species tested. These results define the role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in Latin American medical centers and provide a benchmark for future in vitro comparisons.
TI  - Linezolid Pharmacia Corp.
AB  - Linezolid is an oxazolidinone developed by Pharmacia (formerly Pharmacia & Upjohn) for the treatment of multi-resistant Gram-positive infections [187765,317456]. It binds to ribosomal 50S subunits, most likely within domain V within the 23S rRNA peptidyl transferase and a secondary interaction with the 30S subunit. This results in inhibition of the initiation of protein translation at an early point, which is probably N-formylmethionyl-tRNA [335843]. No direct action on DNA or RNA synthesis has been observed [220169]. Linezolid resistance due to a 23S rRNA mutation may emerge in Enterococci during therapy with this antimicrobial, and may be associated with clinical failure [368652]. Following FDA approval, linezolid was launched in May 2000 [368526,368652]. In April 2000, the FDA approved linezolid injection, tablets and oral suspension for the treatment of patients with infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. It is indicated for adults in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), VRE faecium and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae [363503]. The FDA, however, did not grant Pharmacia indications for linezolid in the treatment of CAP due to either penicillin-resistant S aureus (PRSA) or MRSA. In May 2000, Merrill Lynch predicted sales for 2000 to be US $50 million, rising to US $760 million in 2004 [366910]. In February 2000, P&U predicted that peak sales of the drug had the potential to reach in excess of US $750 million [358429]. In February 1999, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter predicted sales of US $40 million in 2000 rising to US $275 million in 2005 [319855]. In December 1998, Deutsche Bank predicted sales of US $100 million in 2000 rising to US $300 million in 2002 [316769].
TI  - Bactericidal properties of group IIA and group V phospholipases A2.
AB  - Group V phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) is a recently characterized 14-kDa secretory  PLA(2) of mammalian heart and macrophage-derived cells. Group IIA PLA(2), which is structurally close to group V PLA(2), has been shown to kill Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and to prevent symptoms of Gram-positive infection in vivo. We studied the antibacterial properties of fully active recombinant rat group IIA and V PLA(2)s. Both group IIA and V PLA(2)s were highly bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Only high concentrations of group IIA PLA(2) showed some bactericidal effect against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Our results confirm that group IIA PLA(2) is a potent antibacterial enzyme against Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, we show here that group V PLA(2) is a novel antibacterial mammalian protein, but is less potent than group IIA PLA(2). Both enzymes may be considered as future therapeutic agents against bacterial infections.
TI  - Reality check: should we try to detect and isolate vancomycin-resistant enterococci patients?
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance, including vancomycin resistance in enterococci (VRE), is a growing problem in healthcare facilities. This "Reality Check" session focused on the question of whether we should try to detect and isolate patients colonized or infected with VRE.
TI  - Determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  - There are many skin antiseptics commercially available. Although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. To date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. An 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems. Freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. A bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Several micro-organisms were investigated: - Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium (VRE), S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX, active compound of Dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. Results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained in suspension and glass-carrier tests. The bactericidal activity of the biocides depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. All biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against Ent. faecalis and VRE. The antibacterial activity of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. In the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of P. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). PCMX, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. Chlorhexidine tested against P. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. These results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.
TI  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin: a therapeutic review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The proliferation of multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), has created a pressing need for effective alternative antibiotics. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new combination streptogramin product with a selective spectrum of antibacterial activity, mainly against gram-positive aerobic bacteria. It has been assessed primarily in emergency-use protocols, in hospitalized patients with skin and skin-structure infections, and in patients with VREF bacteremia. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review were to summarize important results of in vitro microbiologic studies; to provide information on relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, drug interactions, and Y-site compatibility; and to assess efficacy and safety data from clinical studies of quinupristin/dalfopristin. METHODS: Articles included in this review were identified by a MEDLINE search of the literature published between 1966 and September 2000 using the terms Synercid, quinupristin, and dalfopristin. Additional articles were retrieved from the reference lists of articles identified in the MEDLINE search. RESULTS: In vitro analysis of the spectrum of activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin has confirmed its relatively selective coverage of gram-positive aerobic bacteria. Both quinupristin and dalfopristin undergo hepatic metabolism and are extensively excreted in the feces. Combination quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4 pathway, and caution is warranted with concomitant use of other medications eliminated via this pathway. In trials in patients with VREF infections, treatment success with quinupristin/dalfopristin varied depending on the site of infection, ranging from 51.9% in bacteremia of unknown origin to 88.9% in urinary tract infections. The results of comparative clinical trials suggest that quinupristin/dalfopristin has similar efficacy to that of commonly used antibiotics, including cefazolin, oxacillin, and vancomycin, in patients with skin and skin-structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia. The most frequently reported adverse effects with administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin were infusion-site inflammation, pain, and edema; other infusion-site reactions; and thrombophlebitis. Arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and rash occurred in 2.5% to 4.6% of patients and were the most frequently reported systemic adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes data from clinical trials indicate that quinupristin/dalfopristin has the potential to play an important role in the treatment of bacteremia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by VREF. Issues of bacterial resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin and other appropriate uses of this combination agent remain to be elucidated.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo properties of Ro 63-9141, a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Ro 63-9141 is a new member of the pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem series of  cephalosporins. Its antibacterial spectrum was evaluated against significant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in comparison with those of reference drugs, including cefotaxime, cefepime, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. Ro 63-9141 showed high antibacterial in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria except ampicillin-resistant enterococci, particularly vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium. Its MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (MIC(90)) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 4 microg/ml. Ro 63-9141 was bactericidal against MRSA. Development of resistance to the new compound in MRSA was not observed. Ro 63-9141 was more potent than cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) = 2 microg/ml). It was active against ceftazidime-susceptible strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against Enterobacteriaceae except Proteus vulgaris and some isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The basis for the antibacterial spectrum of Ro 63-9141 lies in its affinity to essential penicillin-binding proteins, including PBP 2' of MRSA, and its stability towards beta-lactamases. The in vivo findings were in accordance with the in vitro susceptibilities of the pathogens. These data suggest the potential utility of Ro 63-9141 for the therapy of infections caused by susceptible pathogens, including MRSA. Since insufficient solubility of Ro 63-9141 itself precludes parenteral administration in humans, a water-soluble prodrug, Ro 65-5788, is considered for development.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of two daptomycin regimens against clinical strains of glycopeptide intermediate-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  - Daptomycin is an investigational lipopeptide antibiotic active against gram-positive organisms. The mechanism of action is unique, resulting in interference with cell membrane transport. The bactericidal activity of daptomycin was evaluated against glycopeptide-intermediate susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in an in vitro infection model with simulated endocardial vegetations. Simulated regimens of daptomycin at 6 mg/kg/day (D6) and 10 mg/kg/day (D10) were utilized. MICs and MBCs for daptomycin were determined in the absence and in the presence of albumin with the following results (MIC/MBC): for GISA-992, 0.5/1.0 and 16/16; for VREF-590, 2.0/2.0 and 32/32; and for MRSA-494, 0.25/0.25 and 1.0/4.0 microg/ml, respectively. During the first 8 h daptomycin significantly reduced the inoculum for all organisms. Daptomycin at 6 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day had log(10) CFU/g reductions of 5 and 6, 3.4 and 5, and 6.4 and 6.5 by 8 h for GISA-992, VREF-590, and MRSA-494, respectively. Against both GISA-992 and VREF-590, the D10 regimen achieved the limit of detection at 72 h, with D6 regimens showing slight regrowth. A concentration-dependent killing effect was noted to occur, with daptomycin demonstrating a more rapid and greater kill from the D10 versus the D6 regimen. The results of this study suggest that daptomycin demonstrates significant (P < 0.05) activity against gram-positive organisms in a simulated sequestered infection site.
TI  - [Surveillance of gram positive cocci susceptibility to betalactams, glycopeptides, and other antimicrobials].
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the last decade, there has been a progressive increase in the  resistance of gram (+) cocci to betalactamics and other antimicrobials. Therefore, vancomycin and teicoplanin have incorporated as alternative antimicrobial drugs. AIM: To assess the susceptibility of gram (+) cocci to different antimicrobials including vancomycin and teicoplanin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 447 strains of gram (+) cocci coming from ambulatory and hospitalized patients. These included 308 Enterococcus sp strains, 99 Staphylococcus aureus strains and 40 coagulase negative Staphylococci strains. Enterococci susceptibility was measured using minimal inhibitory concentrations in agar and that of Staphylococci, through diffusion. Susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin was measured using minimal inhibitory concentrations in all strains. RESULTS: Enterococcus faecalis was 100% susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin, 23% susceptible to tetracyclin and 47% to chloramphenicol. Susceptibility of E faecium was 61% to penicillin, 49% to chloramphenicol, 41% to tetracyclin, 100% to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Of 19 Enterococcus spp strains, 90% were susceptible to ampicillin, 80% to penicillin, 55% to chloramphenicol and 45% to tetracyclin. Only one E casseiflavus strain had a low level resistance to vancomycin and was susceptible to teicoplanin. No Staphylococcus aureus strain was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSIONS: A permanent surveillance of gram (+) cocci antimicrobial susceptibility is required to update therapeutic schemes.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new adamantane derivatives II.
AB  - A series of new derivatives of adamantane was synthesised. The new compound 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride obtained from 1-adamantaneethanol and trimellitic anhydride chloride, as well as 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride, appeared very useful for preparation of a number of N-substituted phthalimides. Antimicrobial activity of newly obtained derivatives such as, for example, 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-phenylalanyl)phthalimide or 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-leucyl)-phthalimide was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Micrococcus flavus and Enterococcus faecium. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for these compounds against Bacillus cereus were 15 and 8 microg/ml, respectively.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the World Health Organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated for a number of years. To assess the accuracy of data submitted to the World Health Organization by users of the WHONET software, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the United States, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing as part of the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. Most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as Enterobacter cloacae. Although only a small subset of laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing S. aureus ATCC 25923 and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. The narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. Thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility to everninomycin of gram-positive nosocomial pathogens isolated from intensive care units in Germany.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-positive bacteria are increasingly found to be causative pathogens in nosocomial infections, and the occurrence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci as well as staphylococci has prompted the investigation of alternative antimicrobial agents active against these strains. Everninomycin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic, has excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to vancomycin. However, avilamycin, a related compound, has been used in Europe as a growth promoter in animal food for years and concern has been raised that cross-resistance in clinical isolates may arise. METHODS: We studied a collection of 268 nosocomial gram-positive isolates from intensive care unit patients with nosocomial pneumonia, urinary tract infection and sepsis, using standard in vitro susceptibility testing. RESULTS: It could be shown that all species tested were exquisitely sensitive to everninomycin (MIC(90) of 0.38 microg/ml for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 microg/ml for enterococci and 0.75 microg/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci). Furthermore, no difference could be observed between methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or between Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that everninomycin is a promising antibiotic for the treatment of nosocomial infections in intensive care unit patients and that the use of a related substance as an additive in animal food has not yet promoted resistance in clinical isolates.
TI  - Use of preclinical data for selection of a phase II/III dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical MIC breakpoint.
AB  - One of the most challenging issues in the design of phase II/III clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. The choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the MIC, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. It is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (PDs) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of MICs for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the PK parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the PD target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. In performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus) and determined the MICs using E-test methods (AB Biodisk, Stockholm, Sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. Population PK data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using NPEM III. PD targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: S. pneumoniae (n = 5), E. faecalis (n = 2), and S. aureus (n = 4). Drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/MIC (AUC/MIC) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. There were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) CFU), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or 90% maximal killing effect (90% E(max)). The levels of protein binding in humans and mice were similar. The PK and PD of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five Monte Carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. The fractional probability of attaining the three PD targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. All differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target AUC/MIC in this PD model were significant. For S. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three PD targets was high for both doses. For S. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (S. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% E(max) AUC/MIC targets. This same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro MIC breakpoints.
TI  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a ketolide antimicrobial agent, was investigated and compared with those of seven other antibiotics. Type strains and 733 Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic isolates of clinical origin and four CHLAMYDIA: isolates were used. The activity of ABT773 was very similar to that of telithromycin, the other ketolide tested. The MIC(90) was < or = 0.5 mg/L for all bacteria examined except methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus influenzae and BACTEROIDES: spp. The antichlamydial activity of ABT773 was greater than that of telithromycin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Neither an increase in the size of the inoculm nor the addition of human serum had any marked affect on the in vitro activity of ABT773.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-positive cocci from 25 UK hospitals to antimicrobial agents including linezolid. The Linezolid Study Group.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst Gram-positive cocci from 25 UK hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. A total of 3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the Etest; these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 Staphylococcus aureus, 769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and 996 enterococci. To ensure quality, 10% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were any found to express unusual resistance patterns. The prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) varied widely amongst the sentinel laboratories. The resistance rates to methicillin among S. aureus and CNS were 19.2 and 38.9%, respectively, with MRSA rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43%. No glycopeptide resistance was seen in S. aureus, but 6.5% of CNS isolates were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5% were vancomycin resistant. Vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among Enterococcus faecium (24.1%) than E. faecalis (0.5%) (P<0.05), with most resistant isolates carrying vanA. The rate of penicillin resistance in pneumococci was 8.9%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9%), with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3%, with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux mechanism mediated by mefE. All the organisms tested were susceptible to linezolid with MICs in the range 0.12-4 mg/L. The modal MICs of linezolid were 1 mg/L for CNS and pneumococci, and 2 mg/L for S. aureus and enterococci. Linezolid was the most potent agent tested against Gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of Gram-positive infections in hospitals.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of human beta -defensin-3, a novel human inducible peptide antibiotic.
AB  - The growing public health problem of infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria, in particular Staphylococcus aureus, prompted us to screen human epithelia for endogenous S. aureus-killing factors. A novel 5-kDa, nonhemolytic antimicrobial peptide (human beta-defensin-3, hBD-3) was isolated from human lesional psoriatic scales and cloned from keratinocytes. hBD-3 demonstrated a salt-insensitive broad spectrum of potent antimicrobial activity against many potentially pathogenic microbes including multiresistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Ultrastructural analyses of hBD-3-treated S. aureus revealed signs of cell wall perforation. Recombinant hBD-3 (expressed as a His-Tag-fusion protein in Escherichia coli) and chemically synthesized hBD-3 were indistinguishable from naturally occurring peptide with respect to their antimicrobial activity and biochemical properties. Investigation of different tissues revealed skin and tonsils to be major hBD-3 mRNA-expressing tissues. Molecular cloning and biochemical analyses of antimicrobial peptides in cell culture supernatants revealed keratinocytes and airway epithelial cells as cellular sources of hBD-3. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and contact with bacteria were found to induce hBD-3 mRNA expression. hBD-3 therefore might be important in the innate epithelial defense of infections by various microorganisms seen in skin and lung, such as cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens induce abscess formation by CD4(+) T-cell activation via the  CD28-B7-2 costimulatory pathway.
AB  - Abscesses are a classic host response to infection by many pathogenic bacteria. The immunopathogenesis of this tissue response to infection has not been fully elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that T cells are involved in the pathologic process, but the role of these cells remains unclear. To delineate the mechanism by which T cells mediate abscess formation associated with intra-abdominal sepsis, the role of T-cell activation and the contribution of antigen-presenting cells via CD28-B7 costimulation were investigated. T cells activated in vitro by zwitterionic bacterial polysaccharides (Zps) known to induce abscess formation required CD28-B7 costimulation and, when adoptively transferred to the peritoneal cavity of naive rats, promoted abscess formation. Blockade of T-cell activation via the CD28-B7 pathway in animals with CTLA4Ig prevented abscess formation following challenge with different bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and a combination of Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides distasonis. In contrast, these animals had an increased abscess rate following in vivo T-cell activation via CD28 signaling. Abscess formation in vivo and T-cell activation in vitro required costimulation by B7-2 but not B7-1. These results demonstrate that abscess formation by pathogenic bacteria is under the control of a common effector mechanism that requires T-cell activation via the CD28-B7-2 pathway.
TI  - Comparative In vitro activities of daptomycin and vancomycin against resistant gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 224 current gram-positive clinical isolates including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. (MRSS), and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was evaluated. The MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited for daptomycin and vancomycin, respectively, were as follows: MRSA, 1 and 2 microg/ml; MRSS, 1 and 4 microg/ml; PRSP, 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; and VREF, 2 and >64 microg/ml. Daptomycin was bactericidal against 82% of 17 VREF isolates. The antibacterial activity of daptomycin was strongly dependent on the calcium concentration of the medium. Daptomycin was active against all gram-positive cocci tested.
TI  - Quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - To understand quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan, where this agent is not yet available for clinical use, we evaluated 1,287 nonduplicate isolates recovered from January 1996 to December 1999 for in vitro susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and other newer antimicrobial agents. All methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. High rates of nonsusceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin (MICs, >/=2 microg/ml) were demonstrated for the following organisms: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (31%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (16%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8%), viridans group streptococci (51%), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (85%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (100%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (66%), Leuconostoc spp. (100%), Lactobacillus spp. (50%), and Pediococcus spp. (87%). All isolates of MSSA, MRSA, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. The rates of nonsusceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin were 5 and 7%, respectively, for CoNS, ranging from 12 and 18% for S. simulans to 0 and 0% for S. cohnii and S. auricularis. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin had good activities against these isolates except for ciprofloxacin-resistant vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. In Taiwan, virginiamycin has been used in animal husbandry for more than 20 years, which may contribute to the high rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance.
TI  - In vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobial agents against 360 clinical isolates from Korea.
AB  - The emergence of multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci such as methicillin-resistant (MR) staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant (VR) enterococci, and vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus (VISA) has given new urgency to the development of new antimicrobial agents. One of these is quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D). We decided to determine the susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated at two university hospitals in Seoul to Q/D and compare the results with eight other antimicrobial agents. We investigated 120 isolates of S. aureus including 49 MRSAs and one VISA, 120 isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), 64 E. faecalis and 56 E. faecium, including seven strains of VR E. faecium. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for several antimicrobials, including vancomycin and Q/D, were determined by broth microdilution. All S. aureus including VISA were susceptible to Q/D. Q/D MIC90 for both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA was 0.25 g/mL. 49 (87.5%) of 56 E. faecium including six of seven VR E. faecium were susceptible to Q/D. E. faecalis were not susceptible to Q/D (only 1.5% susceptible), but were inhibited by ampicillin (94% susceptible) or vancomycin (95%). CNS was susceptible to Q/D (96% susceptible) and vancomycin (100% susceptible). One of 38 staphylococci and two of 17 E. faecium were tolerant to Q/D. In conclusion, Q/D showed excellent activity against all species of gram-positive cocci including MRSA, VISA, and VR E. faecium except E. faecalis, and may provide a valuable option for the treatment of infections caused by these emerging nosocomial pathogens of gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Sensitivity to antibiotics of bacteria from nosocomial infections. Evolution in  resuscitation services of military hospitals].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study, conducted in the French Military hospitals, was to monitor the course of the antimicrobial sensibility of bacteria isolated from nosocomial infection in intensive care units. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study has been conducted from January to December 1998 in all the intensive care units of the French Army. All the non-repetitive strains isolated from nosocomial infection were collected and sent to a reference centre. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. Beta-lactamase were identified by iso-electro-focalisation. Antibiotics choice and interpretative criteria were those of the "Comite Francais de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie". RESULTS: A total of 849 strains are included in this study. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated bacterium (20%) followed by Escherichia coli (19%) Staphylococcus aureus (15%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) (11%) and Enterococci (7%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae (336 isolates; 100% susceptibility). Gentamicin (92%), amikacin (92%) third generation cephalosporins (83%), aztreonam (83%) and ciprofloxacin (78%) were also very effective. Resistance to III generation cephalosporins was correlated with an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (BLSE) in 36% of cases. This BLSE could be associated with an over production of the constitutive cephalosporinase. The most frequent species producing BLSE were Enterobacter aerogenes (75% of BLSE) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (17%). Among the 172 P. aeruginosa isolated, antimicrobial susceptibility were respectively: 71% for imipenem, 62%: tobramycin, 60%: amikacin 59%: ciprofloxacin 59% piperacillin + tazobactam, 55% piperacillin, 53%: ceftazidime and 44% for ticarcillin. Seventy per cent of the 96 CoNS and 50.2% of the 126 S. aureus isolated were resistant to methicillin. A strain of S. aureus and 2 CoNS strains had intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. Twenty per cent of the 59 Enterococci strains isolated were resistant to aminopenicillins (10/11 strains of E. faecium), and 9% presented a high level of resistance to gentamicine. One strain of E. faecium was resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The evolution of the susceptibility to antibiotics in intensive care units reflects the antibiotic pressure and level of cross-transmission. High rates of meticillin-resistance among staphylococci, of resistance to beta-lactams antibiotics among P. aeruginosa and of ciprofloxacin among Enterobacteriaceae are shown in this study. The implementation of appropriate strategies for surveillance and prevention is necessary.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial pathogens: a survey of project ICARE laboratories.
AB  - A proficiency testing project was conducted among 48 microbiology laboratories participating in Project ICARE (Intensive Care Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology). All laboratories correctly identified the Staphylococcus aureus challenge strain as oxacillin- resistant and an Enterococcus faecium strain as vancomycin-resistant. Thirty-one (97%) of 32 laboratories correctly reported the Streptococcus pneumoniae strain as erythromycin-resistant. All laboratories testing the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin correctly reported the organism as resistant. Of 40 laboratories, 30 (75%) correctly reported resistant MICs or zone sizes for the imipenem- and meropenem-resistant Serratia marcescens. For the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 18 (42%) of 43 laboratories testing ceftazidime correctly reported ceftazidime MICs in the resistant range. These results suggest that current testing generally produces accurate results, although some laboratories have difficulty detecting resistance to carbapenems and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. This highlights the need for monitoring how well susceptibility test systems in clinical laboratories detect emerging resistance.
TI  - In vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (mAbKT) and recombinant single-chain (scFvKT) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (KT) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. Pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, KT-cell wall receptors (KTR), have proven to be killed in vitro by mAbKT and scFvKT. mAbKT and scFvKT exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against KTR of infecting microorganisms. The swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. Thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mAbKT and scFvKT against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mAbKT and scFvKT generated by hybridoma and DNA recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a KT-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb KT4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. These bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. RESULTS: According to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mAbKT and scFvKT. CONCLUSIONS: scFvKT exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of chaff vinegar and its practical application.
AB  - Since enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella, etc., sometimes contaminate animal feces and may cause infectious diseases to humans, it is important to remove pathogenic bacteria from domestic animal waste. For the purpose, we examined the antibacterial activity of chaff vinegar. We found that the chaff vinegar inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria immediately in vitro but not efficiently spores and lactic acid bacteria. Further, it removes bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae, from animal feces and the surface of the concrete-floor in the cattle barn. Chaff vinegar is advertised as a natural chemical substance for a soil conditioner, to promote the composting and to deodorize their smell. Chaff vinegar may be useful for organic agriculture without enteric pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new adamantane derivatives I.
AB  - A series of fourteen derivatives of adamantane was synthesised. The new compound  4-(adamant-1-ylmethoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride obtained from 1-adamantane-methanol and trimellitic anhydride chloride appeared very useful for preparation of a number of N-substituted phthalimides. Antimicrobial activity of the newly obtained derivatives such as, for example, 4-(adamant-1-ylmethoxycarbonyl)-N-(5-carboxypentamethylene)p hthalimide or 4-(adamant-1-ylmethoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-alanyl)phthalimide was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Micrococcus flavus and Enterococcus faecium. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for these compounds against S. aureus were 0.022 and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively.
TI  - Binding kinetics of triclosan (Irgasan) to alloplastic vascular grafts: an in vitro study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the binding kinetics of triclosan (Irgasan) to alloplastic vascular grafts and to examine its antimicrobial activity against various microbial pathogens in vitro. Vascular grafts made by Intergard (Intervascular), Fluoropassiv (Vascutek), and Gore-tex (Gore) were examined. Grafts were incubated in 10 g/L triclosan (Irgasan), dried, sterilized, and incubated in RPMI medium. One-centimeter segments of the grafts were resected under sterile conditions at intervals of minutes, then hours, followed by days and up to 4 weeks. Samples were stored frozen at -20 degrees C for the measurement of triclosan bound to the vascular graft by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The binding kinetics under perfusion conditions were determined for Intergard grafts, which were perfused with 50 mL of nutrient medium for 24 hr. Samples were taken at various time intervals for the measurement of triclosan. The antimicrobial activity of triclosan against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans as well as Enterococcus faecium was determined. Triclosan effectively binds to vascular graft without the use of intermediate binding substances. It stayed on the graft for the duration of 4 weeks. Under both static and perfusion conditions, the binding kinetics are similar. Triclosan binds most effectively to Intergard grafts, less so to Fluoropassiv grafts, and not at all to Gore-tex material. Antimicrobial activity of triclosan is very effective against S. aureus and E. faecium but not against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of temporin A analogs.
AB  - Temporin A (TA) is a small, basic, highly hydrophobic, antimicrobial peptide amide (FLPLIGRVLSGIL-NH2) found in the skin of the European red frog, Rana temporaria. It has variable antibiotic activities against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including clinically important methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains. In this investigation the antimicrobial activity and structural characteristics of TA synthetic analogs were studied. For antibacterial activity against S. aureus and enterococcal strains, the hydrophobicity of the N-terminal amino acid of TA was found to be important as well as a positive charge at amino acid position 7, and bulky hydrophobic side chains at positions 5 and 12. Replacing isoleucine with leucine at amino acid positions 5 and 12 resulted in the greatest enhancement of antibacterial activity. In addition, there was little difference between the activities of TA and its all-D enantiomer, indicating that the peptide probably exerts its effect on bacteria via non-chiral interactions with membrane lipids.
TI  - Evaluation of gemifloxacin (SB-265805, LB20304a): in vitro activity against over  6000 gram-positive pathogens from diverse geographic areas.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (GEMI), formerly SB-265805 and LB20304, is a newer fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. The present investigation extended earlier observations by sampling an additional 6790 gram-positive organisms from more than 50 medical centres on three continents. The reference broth microdilution method with recommended medium supplements was used throughout. Selected results (number strains tested; MIC90 for GEMI/trovafloxacin in mg/l; % < or = 1 mg/l for GEMI/trovafloxacin) were: Staphylococcus aureus (3672; 2/2; 86/85), S. epidermidis (404; 1/>4; 92/71), Enterococcus faecalis (630; 4/>4; 76/66), E. faecium (216; > 4/>4; 15/11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (300; 0.06/0.25; 100/97), beta-haemolytic streptococci (150; 0.06/0.25; 100/100) and viridans group streptococci (150; 0.12/0.25; 99/97). Gemifloxacin appeared equal or superior to trovafloxacin in its overall gram-positive spectrum of activity pending a choice of the susceptible breakpoint concentration. Continued in vitro, pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations of gemifloxacin appear warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, resistance of Gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. New antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. We conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates of the gram-positive cocci, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. RESULTS: All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s were 1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S aureus. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. The MIC90s were 1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S pyogenes and viridans streptococci. Ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. H influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. B catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. CONCLUSIONS: We found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and B catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against H influenzae.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of novel anilinouracils which selectively inhibit DNA polymerase III of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The 6-anilinouracils are novel dGTP analogs that selectively inhibit the replication-specific DNA polymerase III of gram-positive eubacteria. Two specific derivatives, IMAU (6-[3'-iodo-4'-methylanilino]uracil) and EMAU (6-[3'-ethyl-4'-methylanilino]uracil), were substituted with either a hydroxybutyl (HB) or a methoxybutyl (MB) group at their N3 positions to produce four agents: HB-EMAU, MB-EMAU, HB-IMAU, and MB-IMAU. These four new agents inhibited Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Time-kill assays and broth dilution testing confirmed bactericidal activity. These anilinouracil derivatives represent a novel class of antimicrobials with promising activities against gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to currently available agents, validating replication-specific DNA polymerase III as a new target for antimicrobial development.
TI  - Comparison of a rabbit model of bacterial endocarditis and an in vitro infection  model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  - Animal models are commonly used to determine the efficacy of various antimicrobial agents for treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Previously we have utilized an in vitro infection model, which incorporates simulated endocardial vegetations (SEVs) to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of various antibiotics. In the present study, we compared four experimental rabbit endocarditis protocols to an in vitro infection model in an effort to determine if these models are comparable. We have evaluated the activity of clinafloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin in rabbit models against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. In vitro models were performed simulating the antibiotic pharmacokinetics obtained in the in vivo studies. Models were dosed the same as rabbit models, and SEVs were evaluated at the same time the rabbit vegetations were examined. Clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin were evaluated against methicillin-susceptible (MSSA1199) and -resistant (MRSA494) strains of S. aureus. Ciprofloxacin was studied against MSSA1199 and MSSA487. Sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin were evaluated against Enterococcus faecium SF2149 and Enterococcus faecalis WH245, respectively. We found that reductions in SEV bacterial density obtained in the in vitro model were similar to those obtained in rabbit vegetations, indicating that the SEV model may be a valuable tool for assessing antibiotic potential in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
TI  - A new rapid automated method for the detection of Listeria from environmental swabs and sponges.
AB  - Many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of Listeria spp. Spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by Listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges, were automatically monitored by the BioSys instrument in a semifluid layer (SFL). The blackening of SFL in modified MOX broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. The instrument detected all nine strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested. None of the gram negative organisms (Proteus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter and Yersinia) were detected by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including Bacillus, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on PALCAM and Oxford media and were also detected in the system. A total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. Of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. L. innocua was the dominant Listeria species in these environmental samples. Good correlation was obtained between numbers of Listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 CFU/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 CFU/swab were detected in less than 22 h. The total assay time was 26 h.
TI  - Prevalence of macrolide-resistance genes in Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium isolates from 24 European university hospitals.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to study the prevalence of the macrolide resistance genes ermA, ermB, ermC, msrA/msrB, ereA and ereB, in 851 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and 75 clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium that were erythromycin resistant. The isolates were from 24 European university hospitals. In S. aureus, the ermA gene was more common in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates (88%) than in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates (38%), and occurred mainly in strains with constitutive MLS(B) expression. In contrast, ermC was more common in MSSA (47%) than in MRSA (5%), occurring mainly in strains with inducible expression. The ereB gene was only found in MRSA isolates expressing a constitutive MLS(B) phenotype (1%). The ereA gene was not detected. Macrolide resistance by efflux due to the msrA/msrB gene was only detected in MSSA isolates (13%). In contrast to S. aureus, erythromycin resistance in E. faecium was almost exclusively due to the presence of the ermB gene (93%).
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships in the series of eremomycin carboxamides.
AB  - A series of new carboxamides of the glycopeptide antibiotic eremomycin was synthesized and investigated in vitro. The goal of the study was the comparison of the influence of the substituents introduced onto the eremomycin skeleton on the activity of these compounds against vancomycin susceptible and resistant bacterial strains. Eremomycin amides derived from amines with small substituents (C0 approximately C4) demonstrated antibacterial activity against vancomycin susceptible strains similar to that of the parent antibiotic and were inactive against vancomycin resistant strains. The derivatives of alkylamines with linear lipophilic substituents (like C10H21) were active against VanA and VanB enterococci strains with the scope of activity similar to that of N'-decyl or 7d-CH2NH-decyl eremomycins described earlier. Eremomycin amides of 5-methoxy- and 5-benzyloxytryptamine were active both against vancomycin susceptible and resistant strains. The introduction of a spacer (lysine or piperazine) between the decyl and antibiotic moieties did not seriously influence antibacterial properties of the compounds in comparison with the corresponding derivatives without a spacer. The most active carboxamides are of interest for secondary modifications of the antibiotic.
TI  - Characterization of isolates associated with emerging resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) during a worldwide clinical program.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is an i.v. antibiotic active against serious Gram-positive infections. Its unique dual mode of action means that the potential for resistance development is expected to be low. To determine the incidence of in vitro emerging resistance in worldwide clinical studies, susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin was measured for baseline pathogens and corresponding on- or post-study isolates from 880 evaluable patients. In comparative studies of community-acquired pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and nosocomial pneumonia, the incidence of emerging resistance was low (1 of 453; 0.22%; 95% CI: 0. 01-1.4%). Resistance development occurred in only one pathogen (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). In noncomparative studies, six instances (1.8% of 338 evaluable cases; 95% CI: 0.7 to 4.0%) of emerging resistance (all vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium) were confirmed, accompanied by therapeutic failure in four cases. Molecular typing did not confirm the identity of one pair of strains. Overall, the incidence of emerging resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was low.
TI  - [Glycopeptides].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and therapeutic use of glycopeptides in intensive care units. DATA SOURCES: Extraction from Medline database of French and English articles on glycopeptides and search along with major review articles. DATA SELECTION: The collected articles were reviewed and selected according to their quality and originality. The more recent data were selected. DATA SYNTHESIS: Glycopeptides are bactericidal antibiotics which are only active against Gram positive species acting by inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis. They had been in clinical use for almost 30 years without high-level resistance underlining. For ten years, there have been disturbing reports of first, resistance to vancomycin in enterococcal species and more recently in strains of Staphylococcus aureus by complex and large mechanisms of action. This new resistances may lead to a therapeutic impasse and a fatal issue for infected patients. The only response to this situation is the respect of prescription rules and the careful use of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Considering their spectrum, glycopeptides are an antibiotic family which importance is fundamental to treat infected patients of intensive care units. Staff members of intensive care units are responsible for their good use.
TI  - Success rates and cost-effectiveness of antibiotic combinations for initial treatment of central-venous-line infections during total parenteral nutrition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central-venous-line infections can be successfully treated with appropriate antibiotics, thus avoiding the need for catheter removal. Based on our experience, vancomycin, gentamicin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amphotericin, alone or in combination, are usually administered, pending sensitivity results. This empirical list, however, has never been verified against actual sensitivity results nor has it been tested for cost or efficacy. METHODS: Medical records of inpatients on hyperalimentation over 1 year were reviewed. Success rate, therapy duration, and drug acquisition cost and charge were assessed for central-venous-line infections. Antibiotics then were paired and evaluated in terms of charge and efficacy against all microorganisms as determined by sensitivity results. RESULTS: In 500 inpatients receiving hyperalimentation for 9,698 patient-days, 8.4 central-venous-line infections/1,000 patient-days occurred. Staphylococcus non-aureus, Candida species, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus predominantly were isolated. Of the infections, 51 (67%) were sensitive to one or more of the initial antibiotics. A 2-week course of antibiotics successfully treated 50 (66%) catheter infections without line removal. Appropriate initial therapy on average reduced treatment duration by 8 to 10 days and drug charges by $400 to $700. CONCLUSIONS: Amikacin-vancomycin appears to be the most cost-effective selection for presumed central-venous-line infections, pending sensitivity results, followed by valid alternatives. Lower failure rates are well worth the extra cost in pharmaceutical charges.
TI  - In vitro activities of LY333328 and comparative agents against nosocomial gram-positive pathogens collected in a 1997 global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY333328 was evaluated for 1,479 nosocomial gram-positive pathogens isolated in 12 countries during 1997. LY333328 MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited for Enterococcus faecalis (n = 351), Enterococcus faecium (n = 100), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 593), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (n = 325), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 110) were 1, 1, 2, 2, and 0.015 microg/ml, respectively. LY333328 demonstrated potent activity against isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin MIC90s, < or =1 mg/L, except 4 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). Gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s, 0.06-0.5 mg/L against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/L against Proteus/Morganella spp.). Relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against Providencia spp., and had good potency against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90s, 0.25-1 mg/L). Gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding MIC90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. The three quinolones were equipotent against Burkholderia cepacia (MIC90s, 8 mg/L), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 mg/L). Gatifloxacin was highly potent (MIC90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., Helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin MIC90s, 0.13 mg/L). The higher quinolone MICs for ureaplasma (MIC90s, 4-8 mg/L) may be due to the acidic pH of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. Like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). Of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. In summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.
TI  - In vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin against Staphylococci and Enterococci, including vancomycin- intermediate and -resistant strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was compared with those of vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin against a variety (n = 203) of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis (MRSA and MRSE, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). Overall, daptomycin was more active against all organisms tested, except Enterococcus faecium and VISA, against which its activity was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin. In time-kill studies with MRSA, MRSE, VRE, and VISA, daptomycin demonstrated greater bactericidal activity than all other drugs tested, killing > or =3 log CFU/ml by 8 h. Daptomycin may be a potential alternative drug therapy for multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms and warrants further investigation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  - Mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. The MICs were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. These concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. Mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with MICs of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. Mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. In an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. We identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine, quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. These had activities similar to that of mefloquine against S. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (MICs for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). They had activities similar to that of amphotericin B against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans. Combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. The MIC and MBC of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. There was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. The compounds were rapidly bactericidal. They appear to act by disrupting cell membranes. Combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in Europe from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  - As part of the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 25  European university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all referrals, with minor regional variation. Of these, approximately 0.36% of E. coli and 16.7% of K. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. Quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with Enterococcus faecium. However, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower in these facilities.
TI  - Chemotherapy for gram-positive nosocomial sepsis.
AB  - Over recent years gram-positive bacterial pathogens have become dominant in many  forms of nosocomial infections. The principal pathogens in severe infections are Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. The utility of the traditional antibiotics used for nosocomial sepsis, particularly beta-lactam agents, has been severely compromised by the spread of resistance and there was, often, no therapeutic alternative to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin, for empirical (and often also the specific) therapy of infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus spp. This reliance on glycopeptides, however, is now also threatened by acquired resistance. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), particularly E. faecium, have become a therapeutic problem in many European cities and are now endemic in some hospital wards. The recent reports from several continents of MRSA with reduced glycopeptide-susceptibility (GISA) is of grave concern. New agents are needed to meet these threats and several classes of compounds are under development. One class is the streptogramins and the combination of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is nearing licensing. Clinical trials and a compassionate use programme have already shown it to have considerable promise for the treatment of the most problematic forms of gram-positive nosocomial sepsis, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections that had failed therapy with other antibiotics.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in Gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK from October 1996 to January 1997 and October 1997 to January 1998.
AB  - Rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 Teaching, nine Associate Teaching and nine District General hospitals) in the UK were compared. Combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in Teaching hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for Associate Teaching and District General hospitals rates fell (Associate Teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; District General 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). Using conventional methodology to determine MICs, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for Staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for Staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for Staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. For Streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). For Enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year 1, 15.1% year 2, P = 0.0388). For Enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin and rifampicin.
TI  - In vitro action of a combination of selected antimicrobial agents and chondroitin sulfate.
AB  - Chondroitin sulfate (CS), a highly anionic polymer and the most predominant sulfated glycosaminoglycan in connective tissues, was investigated regarding to its interaction with cationic disinfectants, which are used as antiinfectives in humans. Combinations of cetylpyridiniumchloride (CPC), chlorhexidine (CHex), and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) with CS, respectively, were prepared and the resulting microbicidal activity of the mixtures was tested in the quantitative suspension test without organic matter. Polyvidone-iodine and Ringer's solution were used as controls. Even precipitated, the resulting test combinations behave differently against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. CPC/CS demonstrated only microbicidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and CHex/CS was more active against Gram-negative bacteria and C. albicans. PHMB/CS, especially in combination with CS-A, only revealed an antimicrobial effect against P. aeruginosa after 60 min action. The interaction of cationic disinfectants with CS showed depending on the investigated microorganism a more or less controlled sustained release manner of the microbicidal agent from the precipitated complex, with the only exception of PHMB in combination with CS-C, which is completely neutralized. Polyvidone-iodine and Ringer's solution were not affected by CS.
TI  - Surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, 1998.
AB  - For the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in Taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. Besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. We re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. The most common isolates were Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among hospital-acquired infections, Acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. The oxacillin resistance of S. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. Among Enterococcus spp., 85% were either E. faecalis or E. faecium. They were 14% resistant to vancomycin. Among gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. This difference was less apparent in the case of Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa. These bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. Fifty-one percent of Salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Isolates from the East were least resistant. Plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against S. aureus, ciprofloxacin against E. coli, and ciprofloxacin against Salmonella spp. These findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.
TI  - Bacteraemia and antibiotic resistance of its pathogens reported in England and Wales between 1990 and 1998: trend analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determination of causes, trends, and antibiotic resistance in reports of bacterial pathogens isolated from blood in England and Wales from 1990 to 1998. DESIGN: Description of bacterial isolates from blood, judged to be clinically significant by microbiology staff, reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. SETTING: Microbiology laboratories in England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Patients yielding clinically significant isolates from blood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and Poisson regression analyses for trend of reported causes of bacteraemia and proportions of antibiotic resistant isolates. RESULTS: There was an upward trend in total numbers of reports of bacteraemia. The five most cited organisms accounted for over 60% of reports each year. There was a substantial increase in the proportion of reports of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to penicillin and erythromycin, and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin. No increase was seen in resistance of Escherichia coli to gentamicin. CONCLUSIONS: Reports from laboratories provide valuable information on trends and antibiotic resistance in bacteraemia and show a worrying increase in resistance to important antibiotics.
TI  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new addition to the antimicrobial arsenal.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - satG, conferring resistance to streptogramin A, is widely distributed in Enterococcus faecium strains but not in staphylococci.
AB  - A gene almost identical to satG was isolated from an Enterococcus faecium strain. This gene was transferred to a Staphylococcus aureus recipient strain where it conferred resistance to streptogramin A. satG was found to be widely distributed among E. faecium strains but not detected among staphylococci.
TI  - Activity of newer fluoroquinolones in vitro against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Several newer fluoroquinolones, which have been recently introduced or are under  investigation, display substantially greater potency against gram-positive organisms than the older generation agents of this class. Nevertheless, for problem organisms including methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many Enterococcus faecium, concentrations of newer antimicrobials required to inhibit 90% of organisms in the collections studied remain above those that are projected to be achievable with clinical use. Nevertheless, enhanced potency of several newer quinolones may result in a favourable pharmacodynamic profile leading to improved outcomes against gram-positive infections and possibly to the delayed or diminished emergence of resistance to these agents.
TI  - Activities of a nitrofurazone-containing urinary catheter and a silver hydrogel catheter against multidrug-resistant bacteria characteristic of catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of a nitrofurazone-coated urinary catheter (NFC) against 86 recently obtained susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Enterococcus faecium, which are species implicated in catheter-associated urinary tract infection and which traditionally have been susceptible to nitrofuran derivatives, was determined using an agar diffusion assay. In a subset of these strains, the activity of the NFC was compared with that of a silver hydrogel urinary catheter (SHC), and the durability of each catheter's inhibitory activity was assessed during serial daily transfers of catheter segments to fresh culture plates. Except for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, the NFC was active against all isolates tested and showed comparable inhibition zones with susceptible and MDR strains of each species. In contrast, the SHC inhibited only certain staphylococci (P < 0.01 versus the NFC), and among these strains, the SHC produced smaller inhibition zones than did the NFC (P < 0.01). Inhibition was evident for up to 5 days with the NFC, but for only 1 day (if at all) with the SHC (P < 0.01). These data document that, for most genera which traditionally have been susceptible to nitrofuran derivatives, the NFC remains active against contemporary MDR isolates. They also demonstrate that the in vitro antibacterial activity of the NFC is markedly superior to that of the SHC in several respects. Thus, the NFC shows promise for clinical use in the current era of MDR bacteria.
TI  - United States geographic bacteria susceptibility patterns. 1997 ASCP Susceptibility Testing Group.
AB  - Antimicrobial drug resistance in bacterial pathogens continues, with 1997 seeing  reports of Staphylococcus aureus no longer fully susceptible to vancomycin occurring in the United States. To better deal with this rapidly developing problem, we present the third year of United States national data that highlights the geographic nature of increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. In 1997, we observed increasing numbers of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, more methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and an apparent spreading of penicillin resistance in pneumococci. The majority of reporting sites now indicates that over 20% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are fully resistant to ciprofloxacin, the only oral agent available for treating this pathogen. With increasing resistance coming at a time of decreasing available resources, it is more clear than ever before that the future of infectious diseases and clinical microbiology remains filled with challenge.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxyquinolone, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin, formerly BAY 12-8039, against gram-positive bacteria was tested by the agar dilution method. A total of 189 isolates that included Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, streptococci, rhodococci, leuconostocs, pediococci, lactobacilli, and diphtheroids were tested. Moxifloxacin showed greater potency than ciprofloxacin against S. aureus, streptococci, and enterococci, having Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) lower than those of ciprofloxacin by 2- to 64-fold. This improved activity was most prominent for S. aureus. Moxifloxacin was active against Leuconostoc and Rhodococcus species. Time-kill studies using moxifloxacin at a concentration of 3 micrograms/mL against one isolate each of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MSSA) (MIC, 0.031 microgram/mL), MRSA (MIC, 1 microgram/mL), two isolates of E. faecalis (MICs, 0.25 and 2 micrograms/mL), and two isolates of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MICs, 0.25 and 2 micrograms/mL) revealed an average decrease in colony forming unit (CFU) by 3.8, 0.4, 4.0, 2.0, 4.2, and 1.8 log10 CFU/mL at 24 h, respectively. Moxifloxacin is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with improved in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria. Further studies of the in vivo activity of this compound appear warranted.
TI  - The role of recombination and mutation in 16S-23S rDNA spacer rearrangements.
AB  - The intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16S-23S rDNA) spacer  region (ISR) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rRNA operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): Enterococcus faecalis (6) and E. faecium (6), Bacillus subtilis (10), Staphylococcus aureus (9), Vibrio cholerae (4), Haemophilus influenzae (6) and Escherichia coli (7). It was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. When these variations were analysed using the program PLATO and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by DNAml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (Z>3.3) spatial variation [Region I was 78-184 nt long (2.1<Z<49.4), Region II was 10-60 nt long (3.7<Z<23)] and Region III was 6 nt long (3.4<Z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. Within Region I, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained tRNA genes (tRNAala, tRNAile or tRNAglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as VS2 (S. aureus) or rsl (E. coli)]. Q Analysis of the ISR sequence from E. faecalis and E. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in DNA sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). Dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn ISRs from S. aureus showed that there was significant homology between VS2 and VS5/VS6. Furthermore, repeat motifs with only A or T were present in higher copy numbers in VS5/VS6 than in VS2. Since these sequence blocks (VS2 and VS5-VS6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in AT expansion may have occurred between these two regions. A model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and AT-expansion in intra-genomic ISR variations. This process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial ISR rearrangements.
TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Listeria). Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. Uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to penicillin (S. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, and in Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Moreover, 1 of 22 S. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 E. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. Resistances to levofloxacin with MIC90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and E. faecalis isolates. In any case, the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. In time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an E. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - Effects of genes encoding resistance to streptogramins A and B on the activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Quinupristin-dalfopristin is a streptogramin combination active against multiply  resistant Enterococcus faecium. Among 45 E. faecium isolated from patients in various French hospitals, only two strains were intermediate (MIC = 2 microgram/ml) and one, E. faecium HM1032, was resistant (MIC = 16 microgram/ml) to quinupristin-dalfopristin, according to British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards approved breakpoints. The latter strain contained the vgb and satA genes responsible for hydrolysis or acetylation of quinupristin and dalfopristin, respectively, and an ermB gene (also previously referred to as ermAM) encoding a ribosomal methylase. The two intermediate strains had an LS(A) phenotype characterized by resistance to lincomycin (L), increased MICs (>/=8 microgram/ml) of dalfopristin (streptogramin A [S(A)]), and susceptibility to erythromycin and quinupristin. This phenotype was also detected in eight other strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. No genes already known and conferring resistance to dalfopristin by acetylation or active efflux were detected in these LS(A) strains. Nineteen other strains resistant to erythromycin but susceptible to the quinupristin-dalfopristin combination displayed elevated MICs of quinupristin after induction (from 16 to >128 microgram/ml) and contained ermB genes. The effects of ermB, vgb, and satA genes on the activity of the streptogramin combination were tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin, E. faecium HM1070 and Staphylococcus aureus RN4220. The presence of both the satA and vgb genes (regardless of the presence of an ermB gene) was necessary to confer full quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance to the host. The same genetic constructs were introduced into E. faecium BM4107 which displays a LS(A) phenotype. Addition of the satA or vgb gene to this LS(A) background conferred resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin.
TI  - Antibacterial diterpenoid acids from Azorella compacta.
AB  - The two novel diterpenoid acids mulin-12,14-dien-11-on-20-oic acid (1) and mulin-12-ene-11,14-dion-20-oic acid (2) have been isolated from Azorella compacta. Their structures have been elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR methods. In contrast to the closely related known mulinolic acid (3) and its dehydration product (4) these new natural products have been shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Costs of treating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) increases the risk of mortality and results in prolonged hospitalization and high utilization of costly treatment modalities. Measures to prevent the spread of MRSA (and possibly VREF) include patient isolation and decontamination, hygiene measures, ward closure, and screening of patients and staff for carriage. In seriously ill patients, the increased use of vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA can lead to the emergence of VREF colonization/infection. Quinupristin/dalfopristin is effective in the treatment of MRSA infections, including nosocomial pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection, and septicaemia. In the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, clinical success rates were equivalent between quinupristin/dalfopristin and vancomycin. In the context of a hospital policy which emphasizes effective hygiene measures and the prudent use of antibacterials, quinupristin/dalfopristin is an effective antimicrobial that can help to control the high costs associated with multiresistant MRSA and VREF infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in key bloodstream bacterial isolates: electronic surveillance with the Surveillance Network Database--USA.
AB  - To assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from The Surveillance Network Database-USA, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the United States. Between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. When staphylococcal isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/mL), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. We also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in Klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). Although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for isolates of Escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections in United States hospitals: a three-year analysis.
AB  - Nosocomial bloodstream infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality. In this study, concurrent surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals over a 3-year period detected >10,000 infections. Gram-positive organisms accounted for 64% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 27%, and 8% were caused by fungi. The most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (32%), Staphylococcus aureus (16%), and enterococci (11%). Enterobacter, Serratia, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Candida were more likely to cause infections in patients in critical care units. In patients with neutropenia, viridans streptococci were significantly more common. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common pathogens on all clinical services except obstetrics, where Escherichia coli was most common. Methicillin resistance was detected in 29% of S. aureus isolates and 80% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Vancomycin resistance in enterococci was species-dependent--3% of Enterococcus faecalis strains and 50% of Enterococcus faecium isolates displayed resistance. These data may allow clinicians to better target empirical therapy for hospital-acquired cases of bacteremia.
TI  - Prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in 20 European university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the current prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance in Europe and compare the in vitro activity of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin against 7057 bacterial isolates from 20 university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme. Amikacin exhibited better in vitro activity than tobramycin and gentamicin against most gram-negative bacilli in Europe. The resistance levels were 0.4-3% for amikacin, 2-13.1% for gentamicin, and 2.5-15.3% for tobramycin among different members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, 75% were susceptible to gentamicin. Only 21% of all enterococcal strains tested were fully susceptible to gentamicin. Although intra-country variations in the prevalence of resistance phenotypes in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as in staphylococci and enterococci did occur, aminoglycoside resistance rates were generally higher in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, France, the UK, and Poland than in Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Compared with the 1987-88 data of the European Study Group on Antibiotic Resistance, gentamicin resistance has increased up to 5% in some gram-negative bacterial species. Furthermore, a greater than 10% increase in resistance to gentamicin has been seen in Staphylococcus aureus during the last decade. The reason for this observation is unclear, although changes in antibiotic prescribing patterns that result in increased selective pressure from gentamicin may have contributed to these increased rates of aminoglycoside resistance.
TI  - The use of enterocin CCM 4231 in soy milk to control the growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The inhibitory effect of enterocin CCM 4231 (concentration 3200 AU ml-1) was used to control the growth of Listeria monocytogenes Ohio and Staphylococcus aureus in soy milk. The growth and bacteriocin (enterocin) production of producer strain CCM 4231 in soy milk was also checked. Bacteriocin production by CCM 4231 strain in soy milk was first detected after 2 h from the beginning of cultivation (100 AU ml-1). The stationary phase for CCM 4231 was reached after 6 h reaching 10.38 cfu ml-1 (log10) with a slight increase up to 24 h (10.43 cfu ml-1, log10), and the maximum bacteriocin production in soy milk (200 AU ml-1) was noted after 8 h of the beginning of cultivation with stability up to 24 h. The addition of enterocin CCM 4231 at 3200 AU ml-1 to a growing indicator strain, L. monocytogenes Ohio, in soy milk resulted in inhibition for 24 h. The high inhibitory effect of enterocin was found after 1 h and 2 h of its addition (in 5 h-6 h of cultivation), the difference between the experimental and the control samples (ES, CS) being 4.96 log cycles at 5 h and 5.15 log cycles at 6 h. Staphylococcus aureus was not fully inhibited, although a difference of 3.55 log cycles was found when ES and CS were compared at the end of cultivation (24 h). The pH was not influenced by enterocin addition. The inhibitory effect of enterocin CCM 4231 against L. monocytogenes Ohio in soy milk was probably bacteriocidal; while Staph. aureus was influenced bacteriostatically. In general, the observed inhibitory activity confirmed the possibility for further application of bacteriocins in food environments as the protective agents. Of course, legislation problems must be solved.
TI  - Inhibitors of DNA polymerase III as novel antimicrobial agents against gram-positive eubacteria.
AB  - 6-Anilinouracils are selective inhibitors of DNA polymerase III, the enzyme required for the replication of chromosomal DNA in gram-positive bacteria (N. C. Brown, L. W. Dudycz, and G. E. Wright, Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 12:555-564, 1986). A new class of 6-anilinouracils based on N-3 alkyl substitution of the uracil ring was synthesized and analyzed for activity as inhibitors of the gram-positive bacterial DNA polymerase III and the growth of gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Favorable in vitro properties of N-3-alkyl derivatives prompted the synthesis of derivatives in which the R group at N-3 was replaced with more-hydrophilic methoxyalkyl and hydroxyalkyl groups. These hydroxyalkyl and methoxyalkyl derivatives displayed K(i) values in the range from 0.4 to 2.8 microM against relevant gram-positive bacterial DNA polymerase IIIs and antimicrobial activity with MICs in the range from 0.5 to 15 microg/ml against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Two of these hydrophilic derivatives displayed protective activity in a simple mouse model of lethal staphylococcal infection.
TI  - Prevalence of resistance to MLS antibiotics in 20 European university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY surveillance programme. Sentry Participants Group.
AB  - Macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics are chemically distinct inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis. Resistance to MLS antibiotics may be constitutive or inducible. The purpose of this study is to update our understanding of the prevalence of different forms of MLS resistance in Europe. The analysis of 3653 clinical pneumococcal, staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates exhibited an average percentage of 21.3% and 6.2% intermediate and high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 21.8% methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 11% vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Geographical differences in erythromycin and clindamycin resistance in isolates of S. pneumoniae and S. aureus strongly reflect geographical variations in susceptibility to penicillin and methicillin, respectively. A very narrow range of MICs was obtained with quinupristin/dalfopristin, with no S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and E. faecium isolate having an MIC of > 4 mg/L, indicating a possible role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of infections by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecium, PRSP and MRSA to RP59500 and their correlations with those to other drugs].
AB  - Investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the Western countries, have been conducted in Japan. A total of 1,239 isolates of E. faecium were collected from 19 institutions during the period of April 1995 and June 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including RP59500 and vancomycin (VCM), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). Susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were also studied. As a result, 2 isolates of E. faecium were found to be moderately resistant to VCM showing MIC of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by PCR method have not been completed. On the other hand there detected no MRSA nor PRSP showing moderately resistant or resistant to VCM. It was concluded that RP59500 and VCM possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated E. faecium, PRSP and MRSA. Among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to VCM showing MIC of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of E. gallinarum, 4 of E. casseliflavus and 2 of E. flavescens. In those isolates, vanC1 and vanC2 were detected by PCR, and vanB was also detected in a isolates of E. gallinarum simultaneously.
TI  - An easy and safe method to store and disinfect explanted skull bone.
AB  - In our department extensive decompression craniectomies became the treatment of choice for patients with massive cerebral oedema following either trauma or acute cerebral infarction. The remarkable survival rates of this neurosurgical technique created the problem of adequate vault defect reconstruction. To evaluate the biological safety of using stored autologous skull flaps for this purpose, we compared three different disinfection methods. Skull bone fragments stored at -21 degrees C for different periods of time were artificially contaminated with clinically relevant strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. As potential methods for disinfection we tested immersion in 3% H2O2, boiling in normal saline for 15 and 30 minutes and a special process of steam disinfection at a temperature of 75 degrees C for 20 minutes. We were able to demonstrate that only steam disinfection completely eliminated the bacterial strains tested. Refrigeration plus steam disinfection of autologous skull bone prior to re-implantation seems to offer reliable safety for its use for defect closure. It is available at reasonable cost in many hospitals and does not require a bone bank.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK between October 1996 and January 1997.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens from 30 centres in the UK (ten Teaching, ten Associate Teaching and ten District General Hospitals) was studied over a 4 month period between October 1996 and January 1997. High-level resistance (HLR) and low-level resistance (LLR) to penicillin amongst pneumococci was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. However, considerable variation in resistance rates was observed depending on geographical location (LLR range 0-15.4% and HLR range 0-30.8%). Considerable variation in resistance rates was also observed for Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, with rates ranging from 0% to 56.7% depending on locality. Using conventional MIC methodology, none of the isolates of S. aureus was considered as having reduced sensitivity to vancomycin. However, eight isolates grew on Brain Heart Infusion Agar containing vancomycin (4 mg/L) after prolonged incubation and are therefore worthy of further investigation by electron microscopy. With Enterococcus faecalis, resistance rates were similar between the three types of hospital and only four isolates were considered resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics (one vanA and three vanB phenotype).
TI  - Susceptibility testing of linezolid by two standard methods.
AB  - To determine to what extent methodological differences affect susceptibility testing parameters for linezolid, MICs and disk inhibition zones were compared using the methods described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy for 198 strains of gram-positive cocci. Zones were 4-5 mm larger by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method, but MICs did not differ, except for pneumococci, which were more sensitive when the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method was used. This is because incubation in CO2 depresses the activity of linezolid against this species only. Breakpoints for linezolid may need adjusting when testing is by other than National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods.
TI  - Comparison of synthesis and antibacterial activity of temporin A.
AB  - Temporin A is a small, basic, highly hydrophobic, antibacterial peptide found in  the skin of the European red frog, Rana temporaria. It was synthesized twice by the FastMoc solid phase method using amino acids protected at the N(alpha)-position with either 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl or 2-(4-nitrophenylsulfonyl)ethoxycarbonyl. The syntheses of temporin A demonstrates the difference between 2-(4-nitrophenylsulfonyl)ethoxycarbonyl and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl amino acids. The purified peptide showed also antibacterial activity against clinically important gram-positive bacteria. It was found to have a moderately good activity against both methicillin resistant and sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus, but a weaker activity against vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - [In vitro activities of 23 antimicrobial agents against 4,993 gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from multicenter of Japan during 1994--in vitro susceptibility surveillance.Levofloxacin-Surveillance Group].
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1994 at 24 medical institutes from different geographical areas of Japan, the susceptibility of clinical isolates to twenty three comparative agents, such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefdinir, cefclidin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, imipenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amikacin, and gentamicin, were tested by the standard broth micro-dilution method. A total of 4,993 isolates tested in this study included Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagllase negative streptococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobactericeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with urinary tract infections or respiratory tract infections, and Haemophilus influenzae. For MSSA, S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and H. influenzae, more than 70% of the isolates was susceptible to fluoloquinolones. However, resistance occurred in more than 50% of MRSA and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI. Fluoroquinolones were found to be effective against high level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, the third generation cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Recent developments in streptogramin research.
AB  - The streptogramins are a class of antibiotics remarkable for their antibacterial  activity and their unique mechanism of action. These antibiotics are produced naturally, but the therapeutic use of the natural compounds is limited because they do not dissolve in water. New semisynthetic derivatives, in particular the injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin, offer promise for treating the rising number of infections that are caused by multiply resistant bacteria. The streptogramins consist of two structurally unrelated compounds, group A and group B. The group A compounds are polyunsaturated macrolactones: the group B compounds are cyclic hexadepsipeptides. Modifications of the group B components have been mainly performed on the 3-hydroxypicolinoyl, the 4-dimethylaminophenylalanine and the 4-oxo pipecolinic residues. Semi-synthesis on this third residue led to the water-soluble derivative quinupristin. Water-soluble group A derivatives were obtained by Michael addition of aminothiols to the dehydroproline ring of pristinamycin IIA. Followed by oxidation of the intermediate sulfide into the sulfone derivatives (i.e., dalfopristin). Water-soluble derivatives (both group A and group B) can now be obtained at the industrial scale. Modified group B compounds are now also being produced by mutasynthesis, via disruption of the papA gene. Mutasynthesis has proved particularly useful for producing PIB, the group B component of the oral streptogramin RPR 106972. The streptogramins inhibit bacterial growth by disrupting the translation of mRNA into protein. Both the group A and group B compounds bind to the peptidyltransferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. The group A compounds interfere with the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing the binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosome and the formation of peptide bonds, while the B compounds stimulate the dissociation of the peptidyl-tRNA and may also interfere with the release of the completed polypeptide by blocking its access to the channel through which it normally leaves the ribosome. The synergy between the group A and group B compounds appears to result from an enhanced affinity of the group B compounds for the ribosome. Apparently, the group A compound induces a conformational change such that B compound binds with greater affinity. The natural streptogramins are produced as mixtures of the group A and B compounds, the combination of which is a more potent antibacterial agent than either type of compound alone. Whereas the type A or type B compound alone has, in vitro and in animal models of infection, a moderate bacteriostatic activity, the combination of the two has strong bacteriostatic activity and often bactericidal activity. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin range from 0.20 to 1 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumonae, from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for Staphylococcus aureus and from 0.50 to 4 for Enterococcus faecium, the principal target organisms of this drug. Quinupristin/dalfopristin also has activity against mycoplasmas, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenz, Legionella spp. and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria develop resistance to the streptogramms by ribosomal modification, by producing inactivating enzymes, or by causing an efflux of the antibiotic. Dimethylation of an adenine residue in rRNA, a reaction that is catalyzed by a methylase encoded by the erm gene class, affects the binding of group B compounds (as well as the macrolides and lincosamides; hence, MLSB resistance), but group A and B compounds usually maintain their synergy and their bactericidal effect against MLSB-resistant strains. erm genes are widespread both geographically and throughout numerous bacterial genera. Several types of enzymes (acetyltransferases, hydrolases) have been identified that inactivate the group A or the group B compounds. Genes involved in streptogramin efflux have so far been found only in staphylococci, particularly in coagulase-negative species
TI  - In vitro activities of two ketolides, HMR 3647 and HMR 3004, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two new ketolides, HMR 3647 and HMR 3004, were tested  by the agar dilution method against 280 strains of gram-positive bacteria with different antibiotic susceptibility profiles, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus spp. (group A streptococci, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci). Seventeen erythromycin-susceptible (EMs), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains were found to have HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 MICs 4- to 16-fold lower than those of erythromycin (MIC at which 50% of isolates were inhibited [MIC50] [HMR 3647 and HMR 3004], 0.03 microgram/ml; range, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml; MIC50 [erythromycin], 0.25 microgram/ml; range, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml). All methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains tested were resistant to erythromycin and had HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 MICs of > 64 micrograms/ml. The ketolides were slightly more active against E. faecalis than against E. faecium, and MICs for individual strains varied with erythromycin susceptibility. The MIC50s of HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 against Ems enterococci (MIC < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and those enterococcal isolates with erythromycin MICs of 1 to 16 micrograms/ml were 0.015 microgram/ml. E. faecalis strains that had erythromycin MICs of 128 to > 512 micrograms/ml showed HMR 3647 MICs in the range of 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml and HMR 3004 MICs in the range of 0.03 to 64 micrograms/ml. In the group of E. faecium strains for which MICs of erythromycin were > or = 512 micrograms/ml, MICs of both ketolides were in the range of 1 to 64 micrograms/ml, with almost all isolates showing ketolide MICs of < or = 16 micrograms/ml. The ketolides were also more active than erythromycin against group A streptococci, group B streptococci, S. pneumoniae, rhodococci, leuconostocs, pediococci, lactobacilli, and diphtheroids. Time-kill studies showed bactericidal activity against one strain of S. aureus among the four strains tested. The increased activity of ketolides against gram-positive bacteria suggests that further study of these agents for possible efficacy against infections caused by these bacteria is warranted.
TI  - A new resistance gene, linB, conferring resistance to lincosamides by nucleotidylation in Enterococcus faecium HM1025.
AB  - Resistance to lincomycin and clindamycin in the clinical isolate Enterococcus faecium HM1025 is due to a ribosomal methylase encoded by an ermAM-like gene and the plasmid-mediated inactivation of these antibiotics. We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene responsible for the inactivation of lincosamides, linB. This gene encodes a 267-amino-acid lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase. The enzyme catalyzes 3(5'-adenylation) (the adenylation of the hydroxyl group in position 3 of the molecules) of lincomycin and clindamycin. Expression of linB was observed in both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme did not display any significant homology with staphylococcal nucleotidyltransferases encoded by linA and linA' genes. Sequences homologous to linB were found in 14 other clinical isolates of E. faecium, indicating the spread of the resistance trait in this species.
TI  - Epidemiologic trends in nosocomial and community-acquired infections due to antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria: the role of streptogramins and other newer compounds.
AB  - The Gram-positive cocci have clearly re-emerged as important pathogens world-wide in the past two decades. Staphylococci, including the coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus, and the enterococci account for approximately one-third of all blood stream infections and as much as 50% of nosocomial blood stream infections. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae is often considered a community-acquired pathogen, it is also an important cause of nosocomial infection. The hallmark of these Gram-positive pathogens is increasing resistance to available antimicrobial agents. Of particular note is resistance to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), aminoglycosides (high-level), and penicillins among the enterococci (especially E. faecium), resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (oxacillin and methicillin) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) among staphylococci, and resistance to penicillin, other beta-lactams and macrolides among the pneumococci. The recent detection of decreased susceptibility to vancomycin among S. aureus is also quite ominous. In many instances the ability of the clinical laboratory to accurately characterize these resistant isolates is suboptimal, further compounding the problem. Increased understanding of resistance mechanisms and correlations of resistance genes with the phenotypic expression of resistance has allowed for modifications and improvements of reference susceptibility tests and interpretive breakpoints. New compounds for effective therapy of infection with multi-resistant Gram-positive species are clearly needed. To this end, the streptogramin combination, quinupristin/dalfopristin, has demonstrated significant activity against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Other candidate drugs including Gram-positive active fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin) and novel compounds such as the everninomicin derivatives (SCH27899), ketolides, and oxazolidinones (linezolid) have been shown to be active against these organisms and are under rapid clinical development.
TI  - Cell-wall determinants of the bactericidal action of group IIA phospholipase A2 against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We have shown previously that a group IIA phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is responsible  for the potent bactericidal activity of inflammatory fluids against many Gram-positive bacteria. To exert its antibacterial activity, this PLA2 must first bind and traverse the bacterial cell wall to produce the extensive degradation of membrane phospholipids (PL) required for bacterial killing. In this study, we have examined the properties of the cell-wall that may determine the potency of group IIA PLA2 action. Inhibition of bacterial growth by nutrient deprivation or a bacteriostatic antibiotic reversibly increased bacterial resistance to PLA2-triggered PL degradation and killing. Conversely, pretreatment of Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus faecium with subinhibitory doses of beta-lactam antibiotics increased the rate and extent of PL degradation and/or bacterial killing after addition of PLA2. Isogenic wild-type (lyt+) and autolysis-deficient (lyt-) strains of S. aureus were equally sensitive to the phospholipolytic action of PLA2, but killing and lysis was much greater in the lyt+ strain. Thus, changes in cell-wall cross-linking and/or autolytic activity can modulate PLA2 action either by affecting enzyme access to membrane PL or by the coupling of massive PL degradation to autolysin-dependent killing and bacterial lysis or both. Taken together, these findings suggest that the bacterial envelope sites engaged in cell growth may represent preferential sites for the action and cytotoxic consequences of group IIA PLA2 attack against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Comparative activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and RPR 106972 and the effect of medium on in-vitro test results.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin and RPR 106972 were active in vitro against a wide range of aerobic Gram-positive organisms including Enterococcus faecium. However, most isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were resistant or of intermediate sensitivity. Against Staphylococcus aureus quinupristin/dalfopristin was more active but for all other species the range of activity of the two drugs was the same or RPR 106972 was more active. RPR 106972 was also more active against the respiratory pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Quinupristin/dalfopristin MICs for isolates of H. influenzae (1-8 mg/L) clustered around the breakpoint. There were differences in the quality of growth, but little difference in MICs or zone diameters was obtained on three different media: Mueller-Hinton (MHA), Iso-Sensitest (ISA), and Diagnostic Sensitivity Test (DST) agars. The addition of blood to the medium increased MICs 2- to 4-fold, with MHA showing the greatest increase, and reduced zone diameters around quinupristin/dalfopristin discs by 3-4 mm, with the greatest effect on ISA.
TI  - Fate of gram-positive bacteria in reconditioned, pork-processing plant water.
AB  - This study investigated the responses of Enterococcus faecium (ATCC 19433), Staphylococcus aureus (196E), and Listeria monocytogenes Scott A in water from a local meat-processing plant. Each bacterium was added to a starting count of 3 log10 CFU/ml and held from 5 to 28 degrees C. At intervals (0, 2, 7, 14, and 21 days), aliquots were plated on appropriate selective agars. In contrast to the gram-negative bacteria studied previously and which grew, the three gram-positive bacteria survived with some slight increase in number in only nonchlorinated, reconditioned water, either filtered (0.22 microm pore size) or nonfiltered. The presence of chlorine in either potable or reconditioned water contributed to the rapid decline in viable counts for all three bacteria. These results further emphasize the importance of residual chlorine in preventing the growth of these gram-positive bacteria in potable and reconditioned waters.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in 10 Portuguese hospitals in 1996 and 1997. POSGAR. Portuguese Study Group of Antimicrobial Resistance.
AB  - During a 2-year period, 10 Portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. Of more than 12,000 Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 71% of S. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested) and 84% S. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. Most of the 5,000 Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 E. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. A high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both Enterococcus species. This survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in Portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in E. faecium. The high prevalence of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and in the CNS remains an issue of medical concern.
TI  - Investigation into the efficacy of disinfectants against MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - In the study reported here, several disinfectants for surfaces, instruments, hands and mucous membrane were tested for their effectiveness against methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The results show that after use of the recommended concentrations with the recommended contact times, which were determined on the basis of the criteria for disinfectants according to the DGHM guideline for the testing and evaluation of chemical disinfection procedures, an adequate effect was able to be proved. Increased resistance of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains to the tested disinfectants was not found. Only after use of diluted solutions differences in the bacterial count reductions were observed. In further studies it is to be investigated whether these differences are due to resistance to antibiotics or to intrinsic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin tested against 1676 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-positive cocci isolated from patient infections in North and South America.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (formerly AM-115) is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum against Gram-positive cocci and some anaerobes. To assess this new agent's activity, a collection of 1,676 Gram-positive cocci were selected for resistance to ciprofloxacin (> or = 4 micrograms/mL) and tested against gatifloxacin and 18 other compounds by reference broth microdilution methods. The strains (approximately 23,000 total isolates from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program) were from significant blood stream, respiratory tract, wound, and urinary tract infections in patients in North (38 hospitals) and South (10 hospitals) America. Against Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, gatifloxacin inhibited only 16% and 10% of strains compared with 12% and 5% for recently released trovafloxacin, respectively. Among Staphylococcus aureus (90% oxacillin-resistant) strains, gatifloxacin was more active (67% susceptible at < or = 4 micrograms/mL) than trovafloxacin (59%) or sparfloxacin (4%). Gatifloxacin had a wider spectrum than trovafloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci especially S. epidermidis, 2% versus 58% resistance. The glycopeptides, chloramphenicol and rifampin were most active. Against all genus/species groups with more than 100 sample strains (1,566), high-level resistance to gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin (> 4 micrograms/mL) was not significantly different (41.7% versus 39.1%; p > 0.05). Emerging resistance to the fluoroquinolones remains a clinical problem among Gram-positive species, and gatifloxacin seems to be active in vitro against many of these contemporary strains isolated in the Americas.
TI  - Novel inhibitors of bacterial two-component systems with gram positive antibacterial activity: pharmacophore identification based on the screening hit closantel.
AB  - This SAR study has shown that the salicylanilide is the pharmacophore for inhibition of the bacterial two-component system. Hydrophobic substituents improve the potency of inhibitors in this series; however, hydrophobicity is not the sole determinant for inhibition; structural and electronic requirements also exist. Closantel (1) was found to inhibit a two-component system and to have antibacterial activity against drug resistant S. aureus and E. faecium.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the semisynthetic compound, hexahydrocolupulone.
AB  - In this study we demonstrate that hexahydrocolupulone (HHC) more effectively inhibits the growth in vitro of Gram-positive organisms than Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Escherichia coli. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by HHC at concentrations < or = 4.06 mg/L. Growth inhibition profiles varied according to the microorganism evaluated (static for S. aureus and bactericidal for Bacillus subtilis).
TI  - Incidence of antibiotic resistance in blood and urine isolates from hospitalized  patients. Report from a European collaborative study. European Study Group on Antibiotic Resistance (ESGAR).
AB  - During 1992-93, 2544 isolates from blood cultures, comprising 52% gram-negative bacilli, 24% Staphylococcus aureus, 15% other staphylococci, 7% Enterococcus faecalis and 2% E. faecium, were consecutively collected and identified in 30 laboratories in 21 European countries. In addition 2512 urine isolates, comprising 82% gram-negative bacilli, 3% S. aureus, 4% other staphylococci and 11% enterococci were collected. The bacteria were sent to 3 laboratories for susceptibility testing by the microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth. The MICs of penicillins and aztreonam for all susceptible gram-negative bacilli were 0.25-8 mg/l, penems 0.032-2 mg/l, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefpirome or cefepime 0.032-0.25 mg/l, gentamicin, tobramycin and netilmicin 0.125-2 mg/l, amikacin 0.5-4 mg/l, ciprofloxacin 0.016-1 mg/l, trimethoprim 0.25-1 mg/l and tetracycline 1-2 mg/l. For susceptible staphylococci the MICs of erythromycin were 0.25-0.5 mg/l, clindamycin 0.125-0.25 mg/l, methicillin 2-8 mg/l, vancomycin and trimethoprim 1-4 mg/l, ciprofloxacin 0.25-1 mg/l, gentamicin and tobramycin 0.25-1 mg/l. For the enterococci the MICs of ampicillin and vancomycin were 2-4 mg/l and of imipenem, teicoplanin and trimethoprim 0.5-1 mg/l. The antibiotic resistance rates varied between laboratories, being lower in northern Europe, except for the penems, cefpirome and cefepime, which showed uniformly lower resistance rates. Compared to the earlier European studies the resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics among the gram-negatives have not changed except with an increase to cefotaxime and ceftazidime in central Europe. Resistance to aminoglycosides had also increased in central Europe from 7-8% to 20-21%, but decreased in southern Europe from 22-24% to 13-14% among the blood isolates and from 12-28% to 6-7% among the urine isolates. There was an increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin in staphylococci from southern Europe. The prevalence of MRSA was significant in central and southern Europe. It is of importance that collaborative national and international studies on the incidence of antibiotic resistance are being performed on a repetitive basis.
TI  - European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey of gram-positive bacteria for 1995. European Glycopeptide Resistance Survey Study Group.
AB  - In the European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey 7078 Gram-positive isolates collected in 1995 from 70 centers in 9 countries of Western Europe were examined, using a standardized, quantitative susceptibility testing method. Of the 7078 isolates, 6824 (96.4%) were tested by the national coordinating centers. Teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.5 microgram/mL) was generally twice as active as vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2852). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC < or = 4 micrograms/mL) and all but four to teicoplanin (MIC < or = 8 micrograms/mL); these four isolates were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL). With coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1444), the distribution of MIC of teicoplanin was wider than for vancomycin. Two and two-tenths percent of coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding Staphylococcus haemolyticus required 16 micrograms/mL teicoplanin for inhibition (intermediate) and 0.4% > or = 32 micrograms/mL (resistant). Among isolates of S. haemolyticus, 4.4% were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL) and 3.3% were resistant (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/mL) to teicoplanin. However, this species represented only 6.3% of the isolates of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Generally, teicoplanin (mode MIC < or = 0.12 microgram/mL) was four to eight times more active than vancomycin (mode MIC < or = 0.5 microgram/mL) against the 770 streptococcal isolates. Glycopeptide-susceptible Enterococcus spp. (n = 1695) were generally four times more susceptible to teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.25 microgram/mL) than to vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL). Combined vancomycin and teicoplanin (VanA phenotype) resistance was observed more frequently (9.3%) in isolates of Enterococcus faecium than in Enterococcus faecalis (0.8%). Four isolates of unspeciated enterococci (1.4%) also expressed this resistance phenotype. Four isolates of E. faecium and four of E. faecalis expressed the VanB-type (low-level, vancomycin only) resistance. Spain was the only country not to submit resistant E. faecium strains while resistant E. faecalis isolates came only from Spain and Italy.
TI  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents used for animal therapy in pathogenic-, zoonotic- and indicator bacteria isolated from different food animals in Denmark: a baseline study for the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring Programme (DANMAP).
AB  - This study describes the establishment and first results of a continuous surveillance system of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria isolated from pigs, cattle and broilers in Denmark. The three categories of bacteria tested were: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter coli/jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). A total of 3304 bacterial isolates collected from October 1995 through December 1996 were tested for susceptibility to all major classes of antimicrobial agents used for therapy in Denmark. Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Acquired resistance to all antimicrobials was found. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. In general, resistance was observed more frequently among isolates from pigs than from cattle and broilers. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed, as is the occurrence of resistance in other countries. The results of this study show the present level of resistance to antimicrobial agents among a number of bacterial species isolated from food animals in Denmark. Thus, the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies has been established, enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of vancomycin and other antimicrobial agents against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium in the Tohoku district of Japan.
AB  - Susceptibility patterns of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium obtained from various hospitals of the Tohoku district were documented. MICs of 6 antimicrobial agents against a total of 480 strains (380 strains were MRSA and 100 were E. faecium) were estimated. All MRSAs were susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin, but all of them were resistant to ampicillin and benzylpenicillin. None of the E. faecium strains were found to be resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Excluding these, almost all strains of E. faecium were resistant to the remaining drugs. These data suggest that despite the emergence of vancomycin resistance to E. faecium in Europe and in the United States, vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin will nevertheless provide effective bactericidal activity in the Tohoku area of Japan.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animals to antimicrobial growth promoters and related therapeutic agents in Denmark.
AB  - This study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in Denmark. Resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. Three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus hyicus, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). All antimicrobials used as growth promoters in Denmark and some structurally related therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: Avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). Bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. Breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. A total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during October 1995 to September 1996 were included in the study. Acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. A frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin, olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. The occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. The highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. The association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. The results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria from food animals in Denmark. They will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.
TI  - Detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16S rRNA gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. The use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. One hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (n = 2), Streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), Streptococcus mitis (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). Eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected bacterial DNA in nine of 11 blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for PCR; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the conventional identification of the cultured isolates. Bacterial DNA was detected in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures, 18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. The species presumptively identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing were as follows: Pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), Acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); Escherichia spp. (n = 3); Moraxella spp. (n = 3); Staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); Neisseria spp. (n = 1); and Bacillus spp. (n = 1). The results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.
TI  - Substituted salicylanilides as inhibitors of two-component regulatory systems in  bacteria.
AB  - A new class of inhibitors of the two-component regulatory systems (TCS) of bacteria was discovered based on the salicylanilide screening hits, closantel (1) and tetrachlorosalicylanilide (9). A systematic SAR study versus a model TCS, KinA/Spo0F, demonstrated the importance of electron-attracting substituents in the salicyloyl ring and hydrophobic groups in the anilide moiety for optimal activity. In addition, derivatives 8 and 16, containing the 2, 3-dihydroxybenzanilide structural motif, were potent inhibitors of the autophosphorylation of the KinA kinase, with IC50s of 2.8 and 6. 3 &microM, respectively. Compound 8 also inhibited the TCS mediating vancomycin resistance (VanS/VanR) in a genetically engineered Enterococcus faecalis cell line at concentrations subinhibitory for growth. Closantel (1), tetrachlorosalicylanilide (9), and several related derivatives (2, 7, 10, 11, 20) had antibacterial activity against the drug-resistant organisms, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF).
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  - This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500, Synercid) tested against over 28,000 recent clinical isolates from 200 medical centers in the United States and Canada.
AB  - A total of 200 medical center laboratories in the USA and Canada contributed results of testing quinupristin-dalfopristin, a streptogramin combination (formerly RP 59500 or Synercid), against 28,029 Gram-positive cocci. Standardized tests [disk diffusion, broth microdilution, Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden)] were utilized and validated by concurrent quality control tests. Remarkable agreement was obtained between test method results for characterizing the collection by the important emerging resistances: 1) oxacillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus (41.0 to 43.7%); 2) vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium (50.0 to 52.0%); and 3) the penicillin nonsusceptible rate for pneumococci (31.1% overall, with 10.6% at MICs of > or = 2 micrograms/mL). The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus was 0.5 microgram/mL and 1 microgram/mL, respectively. The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was 1 microgram/mL, and only 0.2% of isolates were resistant. Other Enterococcus species were generally not susceptible to the streptogramin combination but were usually inhibited by ampicillin (86 to 97% susceptible; MIC50, 1.0 microgram/mL) or vancomycin (86 to 95%; MIC50, 1.0 microgram/mL). Among all tested enterococci, the rate of vancomycin resistance was 16.2%. The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 (0.75 microgram/mL) for 4,626 tested Streptococcus pneumoniae strains was not influenced by the penicillin or macrolide susceptibility patterns. When five regions in the USA and Canada were analyzed for significant streptogramin and other antimicrobial spectrum differences, only the Farwest region had lower numbers of streptogramin-susceptible E. faecium. Canadian strains were generally more susceptible to all drugs except chloramphenicol and doxycycline when tested against E. faecalis (73% and 89% susceptible, respectively). The U.S. Southeast region had S. pneumoniae strains less susceptible to macrolides (73%) but had more susceptibility among E. faecium isolates tested against vancomycin and ampicillin. The Northeast region of the USA had the greatest rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci. Strains retested by the monitor because of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance (MICs, > or = 4 micrograms/mL) were generally not confirmed (2.2% validation), and only 0.2% of E. faecium isolates were identified as truly resistant. The most common errors were: 1) species misidentification (28.0%); 2) incorrect susceptibility results (65.6%); and 3) mixed cultures (4.3%) tested by participants. Overall, quinupristin-dalfopristin was consistently active (> or = 90% susceptible) against major Gram-positive pathogens in North America, regardless of resistance patterns to other drug classes and geographic location of their isolation.
TI  - Resistant penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which participate in the beta-lactam resistance of several pathogenic bacteria, have different origins. Natural transformation and recombination events with DNA acquired from neighbouring intrinsically resistant organisms are responsible for the appearance of mosaic genes encoding two or three low-affinity PBPs in highly resistant strains of transformable microorganisms such as Neisseria and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains possess the mecA determinant gene, which probably evolved within the Staphylococcus genus from a closely related and physiologically functional gene that was modified by point mutations. The expression of mecA is either inducible or constitutive. A stable high-level resistant phenotype requires the synthesis of a normally constituted peptidoglycan. Enterococci have a natural low susceptibility to beta-lactams related to the presence of an intrinsic low-affinity PBP. Highly resistant enterococcal strains overexpress this PBP and/or reduce its affinity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of lonchocarpol A.
AB  - Lonchocarpol A, a flavanone, demonstrates in vitro inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. This activity is antagonized by mouse plasma, which may account for its lack of in vivo activity. This compound demonstrates no differentiation with respect to the inhibition of RNA, DNA, cell wall, and protein synthesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: an ecological approach to a growing threat.
AB  
TI  - Genesis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), how treatment of MRSA infections has selected for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and the importance of antibiotic management and infection control.
AB  - We extensively studied the epidemiology and time course of endemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the Millard Fillmore Hospital, a 600-bed teaching hospital in Buffalo. The changeover from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus to MRSA begins on the first hospital day, when patients are given cefazolin as presurgical prophylaxis. Under selective antibiotic pressure, colonizing flora change within 24 to 48 hours. For patients remaining hospitalized, subsequent courses of third-generation cephalosporins further select and amplify the colonizing MRSA population. Therefore, managing antibiotic selective pressure might be essential. Other strategies include attention to dosing, so that serum concentrations of drug exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration, and antibiotic cycling. Although there are some promising new antibiotics on the horizon, it is necessary to deal with many resistance patterns by using the combined strategies of infection control and antibiotic management.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of nisin against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the search for alternative antibacterial agents. We examined the efficacy of the antibiotic nisin against 56 multidrug-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Staphylococcus aureus and 29 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis isolates. The test strains represented a large variety of clonal types (as determined by a combination of DNA fingerprints) isolated from a variety of geographic sources, and included some of the major internationally-spread multiresistant epidemic clones of S. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), MRSA strains resistant to over 16 generically distinct antibacterial agents, and enterococcal strains resistant to all currently available chemotherapeutic agents including glycopeptides. In the overwhelming majority of cases, treatment of growing cultures with nisin at 1 mg/L (S. pneumoniae) or 10-20 mg/L (in MRSA and enterococci) caused extensive (10(3)- to 10(4)-fold) loss of viable titre accompanied by various degrees of loss in the optical density of the cultures, which was most extensive in pneumococci (>90%) and least extensive (40-50%) in enterococci. Nevertheless, extensive variation in rates of nisin-induced autolysis was observed in each bacterial species. Serial exposure of a penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae to nisin (1 mg/L) in liquid culture resulted in the rapid appearance of stable nisin-resistant mutants in which the MIC increased from 0.4 to 6.4 mg/L and the resistance trait was transferable by genetic transformation.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY333328 against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We report the activity of LY333328 against 35 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including organisms carrying the vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2/3 genes, as determined by PCR), 33 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 29 clinical isolates of high-level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. All isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/mL LY333328, and 8 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all isolates tested. All isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus were inhibited by 1 microgram/mL LY333328, and 4 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates tested. All isolates of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were inhibited by < 0.125 microgram/mL LY333328, and 0.25 microgram/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all S. pneumoniae isolates tested. LY333328 is a promising new glycopeptide antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), HMR 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE). The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The PAEs of HMR 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3647 exhibited a significant PAE with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x MIC. The bacteriostatic activity and significant PAE demonstrated by HMR 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - [Antibacterial effectiveness of povidone-iodine (Betaisodona) against highly resistance gram positive organisms].
AB  - Antiseptics that are locally applicable gain in significance due to their reliable microbicidal effectiveness and especially due to the rising incidence of highly resistant bacteria. This is because systemically applied antibiotics are not sufficient in eradicating superficial mucodermal bacteria and locally applied antibiotics can cause new resistance rapidly. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the microbicidal effectiveness of Poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrodlidon)-iodine (PVP-iodine) against ten genotypical different methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus-(MRSA-) and five Enterococcus faecium-strains in a quantitative suspension test. The effectiveness of PVP-iodine with protein load (0.2% and 2% albumin) was tested against three MRSA strains. Without any protein load best microbicidial activity (KRt-value > 5) was obtained with concentrations in the range between 1-10% of the original Betaisodona solution after 30s exposure time. With protein load (0.2% albumin) the optimum in microbicidal effectiveness shifts to concentrations > or = 10% Betaisodona solution referring to an exposure time of 30s. With a protein load up to 2% albumin and an exposure time of 30s the bactericidal activity of the undiluted Betaisodona solution is already satisfying, while the 10% solution is not active till an exposure time of 5 min. Summing up PVP-iodine is recommended as a local mucodermal antiseptic against highly resistant gram positives.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities and postantibiotic effects of the oxazolidinone compounds eperezolid (PNU-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766) versus vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The activities of the oxazolidinone antibacterial agents eperezolid (PNU-100592)  and linezolid (PNU-100766) were compared with that of vancomycin against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 200), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 100), and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (n = 50). Eperezolid and linezolid demonstrated good in vitro inhibitory activity, regardless of methicillin susceptibility for staphylococci (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90] range, 1 to 4 microg/ml) or vancomycin susceptibility for enterococci (MIC90 range, 1 to 4 microg/ml). In time-kill studies, eperezolid and linezolid were bacteriostatic in action. A postantibiotic effect of 0.8+/-0.5 h was demonstrated for both eperezolid and linezolid against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and E. faecium.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in a long-term care facility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology and natural history of colonization with  vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) in a long-term care facility. DESIGN: All patients in whom VREF was isolated were followed prospectively, with rectal swab cultures at 2-week intervals, until discharge, death, or clearance of VREF. Clearance was defined as two consecutive negative cultures. In addition, three prevalence surveys were conducted of all patients in residence on one 34-bed intermediate care ward. SETTING: A 400-bed, long-term care Veterans Affairs facility. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six patients colonized with VREF. RESULTS: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was identified in 24 of the 36 patients at the time of transfer from an acute care facility. Seventeen patients had concomitant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and seven patients had a recent history of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. VREF in these patients persisted for a median of 67 days after identification. Treatment of VREF colonization with antimicrobials was associated with prolongation of colonization. Serial surveillance of the 34-bed ward found stable rates of colonization, with only three documented instances of VREF acquisition. During 2.5 years of surveillance for infection, a single case of bacteremia occurred in a patient in whom colonization with VREF could not be demonstrated by rectal swab culture. No infections occurred in patients colonized with VREF. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term care patients have protracted carriage of VREF. Most will improve over time; however, receipt of antimicrobial therapy is associated with prolongation of VREF carriage. The risk of VREF infection is low in this population. When there are appropriate contact precautions, patient to patient transmission occurs at a low rate. These observations can be used to design a practical infection control strategy for long-term care facilities.
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Comparison of agar dilution, broth microdilution, E-test, disk diffusion, and automated Vitek methods for testing susceptibilities of Enterococcus spp. to vancomycin.
AB  - An evaluation was undertaken to determine the optimal method for testing the susceptibilities of 100 clinical isolates and two reference strains of Enterococcus spp. to vancomycin in vitro. Six testing methods were studied by using the following media and incubation times: agar screen with the Synergy Quad Plate (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.), an in-house-prepared brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plate, and an in-house-prepared Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plate, all incubated for 24 or 48 h; broth microdilution (Sensititre Just One Strip; AccuMed International, Inc., West Lake, Ohio) with BHI or cation-adjusted MH broth incubated for 24 or 48 h; agar dilution with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; epsilometer test (E test; AB BioDisk, Solna, Sweden) with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; disk diffusion with BHI or MH agar incubated for 24 or 48 h; and the automated Vitek method with the gram-positive susceptibility Staphylococcus aureus card and R02.03 software (bioMerieux, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.). Growth failures occurred with MH media (n = 6) but not with BHI media. One growth failure occurred with the Vitek method. Results for each testing method for each Enterococcus strain were interpreted as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) criteria and compared to the vancomycin resistance genotype (i.e., vanA, vanB, vanC-1, or vanC-2/3). For all methods, extension of the incubation time from 24 h to 48 h either produced no difference in the results or gave poorer results. The following methods produced no very major or major interpretive errors: broth microdilution with BHI media incubated for 24 h, agar dilution with BHI media incubated for 24 or 48 h, and E test with BHI media incubated for 24 or 48 h. Unacceptable frequencies of very major errors (> 1%) occurred with all methods for which MH media were used. Minor interpretive errors were frequent with all methods. These minor interpretive errors also occurred most frequently with Enterococcus strains with vanC genes, which encoded low-level vancomycin resistance (MIC < or = 8 microg/ml), as opposed to Enterococcus strains which possessed vanA or vanB genes, which encoded higher-level vancomycin resistance (MIC > or = 64 microg/ml). Modification of NCCLS breakpoints, especially for motile Enterococcus spp. (E. casseliflavus, E. flavescens, and E. gallinarum), may resolve this problem; however, in the current study, one E. faecalis strain and one E. faecium strain carried only the vanC gene. The agar screen method may also require reformulation. The current agar screen plate contains 6 microg of vancomycin per ml, which may not detect all low-level resistance associated with vanC genotypes. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of this low-level vancomycin resistance remains unknown.
TI  - Biochemical and genetic characterization of enterocin P, a novel sec-dependent bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecium P13 with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  - Enterocin P is a new bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium P13 isolated from a Spanish dry-fermented sausage. Enterocin P inhibited most of tested spoilage and food-borne gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum. Enterocin P is produced during growth in MRS broth from 16 to 45 degrees C; it is heat resistant (60 min at 100 degrees C; 15 min at 121 degrees C) and can withstand exposure to pH between 2.0 and 11.0, freeze-thawing, lyophilization, and long-term storage at 4 and -20 degrees C. The bacteriocin was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, cation-exchange, hydrophobic-interaction, and reverse-phase liquid chromatography. The sequence of 43 amino acids of the N terminus was obtained by Edman degradation. DNA sequencing analysis of a 755-bp region revealed the presence of two consecutive open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF encodes a 71-amino-acid protein containing a hydrophobic N-terminal sec-dependent leader sequence of 27 amino acids followed by the amino acid sequence corresponding to the purified and sequenced enterocin P. The bacteriocin is apparently synthesized as a prepeptide that is cleaved immediately after the Val-Asp-Ala residues (positions -3 to -1), resulting in the mature bacteriocin consisting of 44 amino acids, and with a theoretical molecular weight of 4,493. A second ORF, encoding a putative immunity protein composed of 88 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 9,886, was found immediately downstream of the enterocin P structural gene. Enterocin P shows a strong antilisterial activity and has the consensus sequence found in the pediocin-like bacteriocins; however, enterocin P is processed and secreted by the sec-dependent pathway.
TI  - Cloning of the Staphylococcus aureus ddh gene encoding NAD+-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase and insertional inactivation in a glycopeptide-resistant isolate.
AB  - The mechanism of low-level glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci is not known. A cytoplasmic protein, provisionally called Ddh (W. M. Milewski, S. Boyle-Vavra, B. Moreira, C. C. Ebert, and R. S. Daum, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 40:166-172, 1996), and the RNA transcript that contains the ddh gene, which encodes Ddh, are present in increased amounts in a vancomycin-resistant isolate, 523k, compared with the susceptible parent isolate, 523. Sequence analysis had previously revealed that Ddh is related to NAD+-dependent D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-nLDH) and VanH. This latter protein is essential for high-level glycopeptide resistance in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis by synthesizing the D-lactate needed for biosynthesis of D-lactate-terminating peptidoglycan precursors with low affinity for vancomycin. We now provide the direct evidence that the ddh gene product is Staphylococcus aureus D-nLDH and hereafter refer to the protein as D-nLDH. However, overproduction of this protein in isolate 523k did not result in production of D-lactate-containing peptidoglycan precursors, and susceptibility testing of ddh mutants of 523k demonstrated that S. aureus D-nLDH is not necessary for glycopeptide resistance in this isolate. We conclude that the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in this isolate is distinct from that in enterococci.

AB  
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BO-3482, a novel dithiocarbamate carbapenem with activity  against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - BO-3482, a dithiocarbamate carbapenem, inhibited clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) at 6.25 microg/ml (MIC at which 90% of isolates tested are inhibited [MIC90]), while the MIC90 of imipenem was > 100 microg/ml. BO-3482 was generally less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, enterococci, and gram-negative bacteria, although BO-3482 showed better activity (MIC90) than imipenem against Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, and Clostridium difficile. The affinities (50% inhibitory concentrations) of BO-3482 for penicillin-binding protein (PBP) PBP 2' of MRS and PBP 5 of E. faecium (both PBPs have low affinities for ordinary beta-lactam antibiotics) were 3.8 and 20 microg/ml, respectively, reflecting the greater activity of BO-3482 against MRS than against E. faecium.
TI  - Successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  - Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. It has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. The efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. Vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to MRSA and E. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to S. oralis. Rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) CFU of each strain. Rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) CFU of S. oralis (ampicillin group) or E. faecium and MRSA (vancomycin group). All rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. Teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with E. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with MRSA by 100 and 92%, respectively. Teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with S. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. Prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-MICs. It is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.

TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - Protegrin-1: a broad-spectrum, rapidly microbicidal peptide with in vivo activity.
AB  - Protegrin-1 (PG-1) is a cysteine-rich, 18-residue beta-sheet peptide isolated from porcine leukocytes with antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microorganisms. The MICs of PG-1 against representative gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria ranged from 0.12 to 2 microg/ml. At these levels, PG-1 was rapidly bactericidal in vitro, reducing the number of viable CFU of either methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa by more than three log units in less than 15 min. Resistance to PG-1 did not develop after 11 subculturings of P. aeruginosa or 18 subcultures of MRSA in Mueller-Hinton broth containing PG-1 at one-half the MIC. Under similar conditions of serial passage, the MICs of norfloxacin and gentamicin against P. aeruginosa increased 10 and 190 times, respectively. Similarly, the MIC of norfloxacin against MRSA increased 85 times. Immunocompetent mice inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with P. aeruginosa or S. aureus exhibited 93 to 100% mortality in the vehicle control group compared with 0 to 27% mortality in animals that received a single i.p. injection of PG-1 (0.5 mg/kg of body weight). Mice inoculated with S. aureus by intravenous (i.v.) injection and dosed 0 to 60 min later with a single i.v. injection of PG-1 (5 mg/kg) had a mortality of 7 to 33%, compared to a mortality of 73 to 93% in the vehicle controls. In leukopenic mice inoculated i.v. with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, mortality was 87% in the vehicle control group and 33% in animals that received a single i.v. injection of PG-1 (2.5 mg/kg). Taken together, these data indicate that PG-1 has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in the treatment of local or systemic infections caused by clinically relevant pathogens.
TI  - Presence of UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-hexapeptides and -heptapeptides in enterococci and staphylococci after treatment with ramoplanin, tunicamycin, or vancomycin.
AB  - Analyses of the peptidoglycan nucleotide precursor contents of enterococci and staphylococci treated with ramoplanin, tunicamycin, or vancomycin were carried out by high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). In all cases, a sharp increase in the UDP-N-actetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide or -pentadepsipeptide pool was observed. Concomitantly, new peptidoglycan nucleotide peptides of higher molecular masses with hexa- or heptapeptide moieties were identified: UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide-Asp or pentadepsipeptide-Asp in enterococci and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide-Gly or -Ala and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide-Gly-Gly or -Ala-Gly in staphylococci. These new compounds are derivatives of normal UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide or -pentadepsipeptide precursors with the extra amino acid(s) linked to the lysine epsilon-amino group as established by various analytical procedures (MS, MS-MS fragmentation, chemical analysis, and digestion with R39 D,D carboxypeptidase). Except for tunicamycin-treated cells, it was not possible to ascertain whether these unusual nucleotides were formed by direct addition of the amino acids to UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (or -pentadepsipeptide) or whether they arose by reverse reactions from lipid I intermediates to which the amino acids had been added.

TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and MIC quality control guidelines of RPR 106972  (RPR 112808/RPR106950): a novel orally administered streptogramin combination. The Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - RPR 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against Gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. MICs for RPR 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. RPR 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by RPR 106972 (MIC90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). Against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), RPR 106972 was highly active with MIC results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. RPR 106972 inhibited Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 2 micrograms/ml). RPR 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to Enterococcus faecium (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other Enterococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 1 microgram/ml). Studies to establish MIC quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. The results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of RPR 106972 against Gram-positive bacteria and selected Gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of squalamine mimics.
AB  - We investigated the antimicrobial properties of compounds with structural features that were designed to mimic those of squalamine, an antibiotic isolated from the stomach of the dogfish shark. The mimics, like squalamine, are sterol-polyamine conjugates. Unlike squalamine, the mimics were simple to prepare, at high yield, from readily available starting materials. Several squalamine mimics showed activity against gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and fungi. Some had little or no hemolytic activity. The hydrophobicity of the sterol backbone and the length and the cationic charge of the side chains appeared to be critical determinants of activity. One of the squalamine mimics, SM-7, was bactericidal against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and S. aureus; its activity was decreased by divalent or monovalent cations and by bovine serum albumin. Subinhibitory concentrations of SM-7 markedly enhanced the antimicrobial activity of rifampin against gram-negative rods. These results suggest that the compounds may disrupt an outer membrane of gram-negative rods. Squalamine mimics are a new class of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. The antagonism of their activity by serum and albumin and their hemolytic properties may limit their use as systemic agents. The squalamine mimics, because of their potencies, broad spectra of antimicrobial activity, and potential for systemic toxicity, appear to be good candidates for development as topical antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic evaluation of a new glycopeptide, LY333328, and in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The objectives of the present study were to compare the in vitro activity of LY333328 (LY) to that of vancomycin (V) alone and in combination with gentamicin (G) and rifampin (R) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and V-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), by using the killing curve methods. In addition, the effect of the inoculum size and protein on LY's activity was evaluated by using MICs and killing curves. MICs, MBCs, and killing curves were determined with supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth (B), B with albumin (4 g/dl) (A), and B with 50% pooled human serum (S). For MRSA, time to 99.9% killing after exposure to LY at four times the MIC (4x MIC) was achieved at 0.5 +/- 0 h (mean +/- standard deviation) and was significantly faster than that by V (8.54 +/- 0.10 h; P = 0.001). Against VREF, LY decreased the inoculum by 2.2 log10 CFU/ml at 24 h (P = 0.002). With a large inoculum of MRSA, the activity of LY and V at 4x MIC was decreased compared to that with the standard inoculum (P = 0.0003) and regrowth occurred at 24 h. The reduction in the number of CFU per milliliter at 24 h to 2 log10 CFU/ml was restored by increasing the LY concentration to at least 16x MIC. At 24 h, the combinations of LY and G, LY and R, LY and V, and V and G were better than either LY or V alone against a large inoculum of MRSA (P = 0.0002). LY and G achieved 99.9% killing at 1.01 +/- 0.03 h and was more rapid (P < 0.007) than all the other regimens studied except for V and G, which achieved 99.9% killing at 3.59 +/- 0.01 h. Killing curves determined with different media against a standard inoculum of MRSA did not demonstrate a significant difference between LY and V at 24 h. Time to 99.9% killing was more rapid with LY than with V in B, A, and S (P = 0.0002). Times to 99.9% killing by LY in B, A, and S were not significantly different from each other. Against VREF, LY killed better than V in B, A, or S at 24 h (P = 0.0002). LY in B was more active than LY in A or S (P = 0.0002). LY is a new potent glycopeptide with a unique activity profile. It has a greater activity than that of V against MRSA and has activity against VREF. LY demonstrated synergism in combination with gentamicin against MRSA. LY was affected by large inoculum sizes and proteins in time-kill studies. However, the effect was compensated for by increasing the drug concentration to 16x MIC.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria: clinical applications and therapeutic potential.
AB  - In recent years there has been a dramatic worldwide increase in the prevalence of multiple drug-resistant strains of common Gram-positive bacteria. This highlights the need for a new class of antibiotic with activity against these organisms. Quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first injectable streptogramin antibiotic, has a unique spectrum of activity, encompassing most Gram-positive cocci (including multi-drug-resistant strains), respiratory pathogens and anaerobes, Gram-positive, and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect. Quinupristin/ dalfopristin is active in vitro against multi-drug-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Clinical case reports have shown that the combination is active against intra-abdominal, aortic graft, bacteraemia and hydrocephalus shunt infections caused by multi-drug-resistant enterococci, particularly E. faecium. In almost all of these clinical situations the enterococcal infection had displayed resistance to all other antimicrobial therapies. Preliminary clinical data have demonstrated the activity of quinupristin/ dalfopristin against S. aureus bacteraemia, and quinupristin/dalfopristin may also prove useful in the treatment of pneumococcal infections. Thus, possible future applications of the combination include the treatment of multi-drug-resistant strains of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci. Quinupristin/dalfopristin may prove useful in the treatment of staphylococcal infections in children, invasive systemic pneumococcal infections, and nosocomial and community-acquired Gram-positive infections in patients unable to tolerate beta-lactam antimicrobial agents or glycopeptide antibiotics.
TI  - Development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Although a number of studies have reported the MICs of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. We tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. Zone diameters and MICs were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. Control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of Enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/L as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/L as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. The best correlation of zone sizes and MICs for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an MIC of < or = 2 mg/L was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. These criteria may be useful for identifying organisms that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.
TI  - In-vitro bactericidal activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin alone and in combination against resistant strains of Enterococcus species and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In-vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a semisynthetic injectable streptogramin, and vancomycin were compared against multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and a methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin and/or vancomycin with ofloxacin or gentamicin were evaluated using the chequerboard technique. The only synergy observed was that between quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin against E. faecium (FIC index < 0.5). Time-kill curves were performed over 24 h with an inoculum of 1 x 10(7) cfu/mL and clinically achievable concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin, ofloxacin and gentamicin (6, 30, 5 and 5 mg/L, respectively). In time-kill studies, combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin were additive, not synergic, against E. faecium and achieved 99.9% killing in 21.2 h and 19.6 h, respectively. None of the combination regimens suppressed the regrowth of E. faecalis. Quinupristin/dalfopristin combined with vancomycin demonstrated consistent synergy against ATCC 25923 and the MRSA, achieving 99.9% killing in 12.1 h and 11.9 h, respectively. Overall, quinupristin/dalfopristin alone demonstrated inhibitory activity against E. faecium, but not against E. faecalis, and bactericidal activity was achieved only with quinupristin/dalfopristin in combination with vancomycin or gentamicin against E. faecium. Quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin was the most potent and reliable combination against both strains of S. aureus in time-kill studies.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new water-soluble streptogramin antimicrobial agent comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin in a ratio of 30:70. The in-vitro spectrum of activity includes most multi-resistant Gram-positive aerobes, important Gram-negative aerobes, Gram-positive anaerobes and intracellular bacteria that are causal agents of respiratory, blood and cutaneous infections. Of particular note, quinupristin/dalfopristin is active against multidrug-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium, and against penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The combination is also active against staphylococci showing both constitutive and inducible erythromycin resistance. Bactericidal activity and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect have also been noted for quinupristin/dalfopristin against Gram-positive cocci. Gram-negative bacteria susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin include Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma spp. Overall, the spectrum of antibacterial activity indicates a potential role for this combination in the treatment of difficult-to-treat Gram-positive infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Since this activity extends to Gram-negative respiratory bacteria, quinupristin/dalfopristin may also find a role in the treatment of atypical, as well as typical, pneumonia.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - In vitro activity and spectrum of LY333328, a novel glycopeptide derivative.
AB  - Reference methods were used to determine the potency of LY333328, a semisynthetic glycopeptide derivative with a key N-alkylation substitution, against 833 strains (393 gram-positive strains and representative gram-negative bacilli) with various defined resistance mechanisms. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90S) (in micrograms per milliliter) of LY333328 and the percentages of strains at < or = 8 micrograms/ml were as follows: for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 100%; for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermis, 4 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 8 and 96%; for Streptococcus serogroups A, B, C, and G, 0.25 to 1 and 100%; for Streptococcus pneumoniae < or = 0.015 to 0.06 and 100%; for Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 100%; and for vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 0.25 and 100%, and for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, 4 and 100%. LY333328 was not active (MIC50, > or = 16 micrograms/ml) against more than 400 representative strains of Enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonads, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, pathogenic Neisseria spp., and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Gram-positive anaerobes were LY333328 susceptible (MICs, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Test methods and conditions may have affected MICs of LY333328, with most (species variation) agar dilution MICs being greater than the broth microdilution MICs.
TI  - High incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units  at a university hospital in Sweden.
AB  - The frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units (ICUs) at a university hospital in Sweden was investigated annually from 1993 to 1996. An increase in ampicillin-resistant enterococci from 1993 to 1995 was seen which was due to a shift from Enterococcus faecalis to Enterococcus faecium. After a special infection control programme was instituted, the rate of ampicillin resistance among enterococci and the number of E. faecium isolates declined during 1996. The oxacillin resistance rates for Staphylococcus aureus were < or = 2%, while most of the coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were oxacillin resistant. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci or staphylococci were seen. The ciprofloxacin resistance rate for CNS and Enterococci spp. were high. Relatively, high levels of resistance to cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam among Enterobacter spp. were also seen. During 1995 and 1996 Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed increasing resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. This was due to an outbreak among rather few patients. The overall resistance rates for Gram-negative bacteria were low for aminoglycosides and imipenem. From 1993 to 1996 the total antibiotic consumption decreased by 27% in the whole hospital and 16.5% in the ICUs. However, the reduced antibiotic consumption was paralleled with a 23% decrease in the total number of patients treated in the hospital from 1993 to 1996. In contrast there was an 11.5% increase in the number of ICU patients treated during this period. The conclusion is that all ICUs within a hospital should have a programme for 'on-line' antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit in order to change the empiric treatment when there is an increase in antibiotic resistance. It is also important to survey the antibiotic consumption in the ICUs in order to avoid further selective pressure on bacteria showing increased resistance rates.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. An update on current microbiological patterns.
AB  - Although resistance has developed among Gram-positive pathogens to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and macrolides, the glycopeptides seem to remain largely unaffected. However, the recent emergence and range of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, well documented in the USA but not in the rest of the world, have prompted this European surveillance study. The European Glycopeptide Resistance Survey was undertaken in 1995 in 9 countries and involved 70 microbiological centres. The primary aims of the survey were as follows: (i) to perform a microbiological quality assurance assessment to evaluate the ability of participating laboratories to correctly identify the strains and assess their glycopeptide susceptibility; and (ii) to accurately determine the level of glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci in European hospitals. The in vitro activity of several other antibiotics was assessed on strains isolated from the Italian centres. In total, 7078 Gram-positive isolates were collected in Europe, and national coordinators used the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) agar dilution reference method to successfully retest 96% of these. According to mode minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), teicoplanin activity was similar to that of vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus. In general, the range of MICs for teicoplanin was wider than that for vancomycin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. Against Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., teicoplanin was 4 times more active than vancomycin. The greatest number of glycopeptide refractory organisms was evident among enterococci; resistance was observed to be approximately 10 times more frequent in Enterococcus faecium than in E. faecalis. The results from the Italian isolates were similar to those from the overall study. In particular, teicoplanin was 2- to 8-fold more active than vancomycin against the majority of the enterococci. The incidence of enterococcal resistance was lower in Italy (0.6% for teicoplanin and 0.9% for vancomycin) than in Europe (1.7% for teicoplanin and 2.3% for vancomycin). This extensive survey confirms that teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against enterococci and streptococci, and that both display similar potency against staphylococci.
TI  - In-vitro pharmacodynamic studies of piperacillin/tazobactam with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Six isolates each of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus  epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. (total 60 strains) were studied against the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam plus gentamicin or ciprofloxacin at physiological concentrations by the microtitre chequerboard method incorporating simultaneous time-kill curves. Tazobactam was fixed at 4 mg/L. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam was a synergic combination against 28 strains at 2 h, 51 at 5 h and 54 at 24 h as assessed by time-kill curves and synergic or additive (FBC index < or = 1) against all 60 strains at 24 h by chequerboards. The corresponding figures for ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam were seven, 26, 52 and 58 respectively. Antagonism (FBC index > or = 4) was demonstrated for one strain to each combination at 24 h. There were no significant differences between FIC indices and FBC indices for each antibiotic combination. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 47 strains by 2 h, 56 by 5 h and 59 by 24 h. Ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 22 strains by 2 h, 36 by 5 h and 56 by 24 h. In conclusion both antibiotic combinations at physiological concentrations were synergic or additive at 24 h for the majority of strains tested although notably gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave faster kill. Antagonism was rarely seen. Both combinations are likely to prove beneficial for treatment of serious infections.
TI  - Enterococci acquire new kinds of resistance.
AB  - In recent years, enterococci have become increasingly resistant to a broad range  of antimicrobial agents. The development of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, penicillins, and glycopeptides singly and in combination has important clinical implications. Strains of Enterococcus faecium that are resistant to every useful available antibiotic have been described. Resistance to penicillin can be due to overproduction of penicillin-binding protein (which has low affinity for penicillins) or to production of beta-lactamase. High-level resistance of enterococci to gentamicin is due to the synthesis of a modifying enzyme. In this case, the synergistic activity of the combination of penicillin with any aminoglycoside (except for streptomycin) is totally abolished. Acquired resistance to glycopeptides is often plasmid-mediated and is associated with a major epidemic potential since certain plasmids are self-transferable from E. faecium to a variety of gram-positive organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Testing the efficacy of a molecular surveillance network: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) genotypes in six hospitals in the metropolitan New York City area. The BARG Initiative Pilot Study Group. Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance Group.
AB  - Molecular fingerprinting techniques are rapidly becoming indispensable tools for  hospital epidemiology. On the other hand, the relative complexity and unfamiliarity of these techniques to most hospital diagnostic laboratories limit their usefulness. In an attempt to provide a solution for this dilemma, we tested the feasibility and efficacy of a cooperative venture in which molecular typing of isolates recovered from patients in six hospitals was performed at two microbiology research laboratories with expertise in these techniques. In a small preliminary study, 30 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 30 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) isolates were collected over a 3-week period from six hospitals in the metropolitan New York area and transported to the Laboratory of Microbiology at The Rockefeller University during the summer months of 1994. Nineteen of the 27 confirmed MRSA isolates were closely related strains carrying the same mecA and the same Tn554 polymorphs in a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) background represented by closely related subtypes of a single pattern, indicating the wide distribution of this MRSA clone among the participating hospitals. Typing of the same 27 MRSA isolates was also performed at the Tuberculosis Center of the Public Health Research Institute and identical results were obtained. The 29 confirmed VREF isolates were highly heterogeneous and belonged to as many as 23 distinct clonal types as defined by PFGE patterns and probing with vanA. Characterization of the 60 isolates by these methods was completed in one month of full-time effort by a single experienced laboratory assistant guided by a doctoral-level expert in molecular fingerprinting techniques. The collection of samples for both MRSA and VREF was not intended to address epidemiological questions but to determine the feasibility of a multicenter study. On the basis of our preliminary findings we are encouraged that a larger cooperative effort is possible and with the correct sampling method we believe that epidemiological and surveillance studies could be accomplished that would provide a tracking system to assist hospitals, clinics, and chronic care facilities in controlling the spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Serological investigation of enterococcal infections using western blot.
AB  - To assess the usefulness of Western blot in the diagnosis of enterococcal infections, a pilot study was conducted with a newly developed Western blot using sera from patients with confirmed enterococcal infections. Sera from 17 of 19 patients with enterococcal endocarditis reacted strongly to enterococcal antigens on the Western blot, and most produced specific bands at molecular weights 98 kDa and 54 kDa. Sera from patients with bacteremic cholangitis and pyelonephritis reacted frequently as well, but the pattern of bands was different from that observed with endocarditis. Eighty-five percent of 26 sera tested from patients with bacteremia and associated deep-seated infections (endocarditis, cholangitis, and pyelonephritis) were positive on Western blot, compared to 30% of sera from bacteremic patients with no clinically determined deep focus of infection (p < 0.001).
TI  - Susceptibility of ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci to trovafloxacin.
AB  - The susceptibilities of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci obtained over a 13-year period were tested for trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, and ciprofloxacin. For MRSA, MIC50 values for trovafloxacin increased from 0.03 microgram/ml to 1 microgram/ml from 1984-1985 to 1995-1996, but were lower than those noted for ciprofloxacin, which increased from 0.25 microgram/ml to > 8 micrograms/ml during the same period. Trovafloxacin also showed lower MIC50 values (0.12-0.25 microgram/ml) than ciprofloxacin (MIC50 of 0.5-1 microgram/ml) for E. faecalis isolates from 1985 through 1991, but against E. faecium and E. faecalis isolated in 1995-1996, the MIC50 values for both trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were 2 micrograms/ml and the MIC90 values were > or 8 micrograms/ml. Thus, cross-resistance between fluoroquinolones was shown for both enterococci and MRSA. Whether the greater intrinsic activity of trovafloxacin might allow its use in treating MRSA and enterococcal infections remains to be seen.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance gene transfer from Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium to  Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius and S. hyicus.
AB  - Transfer of gentamicin resistance from Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium to Staphylococcus aureus, S. hyicus and S. intermedius was accomplished by filter mating. Transfer from E. faecalis was plasmid mediated and a probe to the gentamicin resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2") hybridized to HindIII fragments of various sizes (7.5, 6.2 and 4.7 kbp) of these plasmids. Transfer from E. faecium was apparently to the chromosome in 9 of 10 instances with HindIII fragments of 3.3 or 3.0 kbp hybridizing to the probe. These results are consistent with transposon mediated resistance. Plasmid transfers to S. intermedius were at much lower frequencies than to S. aureus or to S. hyicus but presumed transposon transfer direct to the chromosome was equal in all three species.
TI  - Semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from LY264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826 with N-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. The MICs for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY307599 and LY333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - In vitro activity of the trinem sanfetrinem (GV104326) against gram-positive organisms.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the trinem sanfetrinem (formerly GV104326) (GV) was compared with that of vancomycin, ampicillin, and/or nafcillin against 287 gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant enterococci, by the agar and microbroth dilution methods. GV demonstrated 2 to 16 times more activity than ampicillin and nafcillin against the majority of these organisms. The MIC range of GV was 16 to 64 micrograms/ml for 19 Enterococcus faecium strains that were highly resistant to ampicillin (ampicillin MIC range, 64 to 512 micrograms/ml) and vancomycin resistant and 0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml for resistant Rhodococcus spp. Similar activities (+/-1 dilution) were observed by either the agar or the broth microdilution method. GV demonstrated bactericidal activity against a beta-lactamase-producing Enterococcus faecalis strain and against two methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains in 10(5)-CFU/ml inocula. Synergy between GV and gentamicin was observed against an E. faecalis strain that lacked high-level gentamicin resistance. The activity of GV suggests this compound warrants further study.
TI  - Quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500): an injectable streptogramin combination.
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, activity, and potential clinical role of quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500) are described. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is the first injectable formulation of the streptogramin antibiotics. Streptogramin drug products are each composed of two chemically distinct compounds, which when administered together act synergistically by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Quinupristin-dalfopristin has shown activity in vitro against many strains of streptococci and staphylococci, including methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The combination is more active against Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis. It has also shown activity in vitro against certain gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. The mean maximum blood concentration at the end of a one-hour infusion ranged from 0.95 mg/L for a 1.4-mg/kg dose to 24.2 mg/L for a 29.4-mg/kg dose; there was a linear correlation between dose and mean area under the concentration-time curve. Mean half-life ranged from 1.27 to 1.53 hours. The drug is under investigation in the United States in Phase III trials. Of 60 evaluable patients with documented bacteremia involving E. faecium resistant to vancomycin, 40 (67%) had a favorable clinical response. Of 11 patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 78% had a favorable response. The efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin in treating resistant infections has also been suggested by smaller studies and case reports. The drug may be useful in the prophylaxis of endocarditis. Adverse reactions are generally mild and transient. Quinupristin-dalfopristin may be useful in treating serious gram-positive infections, but more clinical study is needed.
TI  - A highly vancomycin-resistant laboratory mutant of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - A resistant mutant with vancomycin MIC of 100 micrograms/ml was isolated relatively easily through step pressure in the laboratory from a Staphylococcus aureus strain with initial MIC of 1.5 micrograms/ml for the antibiotic. Upon addition of vancomycin (50 micrograms/ml) to the growth medium mass increase of the culture and peptidoglycan synthesis continued but cell division (daughter cell separation), cell wall turnover and autolysis were inhibited, resulting in the production of multicellular clumps of bacteria. Parallel with the increase of culture density, the concentration of vancomycin measured both by biological activity and by HPLC gradually declined in the culture medium. Cell division and wall turnover of the culture resumed with the production of cells of normal morphology at the time when the concentration of the drug in the medium decreased below 0.5-1.0 micrograms/ml. There was no detectable change in the antibiotic concentration in the culture medium during growth of a vancomycin-resistant (vanA-positive) strain of Enterococcus faecium and an intrinsically vancomycin-resistant strain of Leuconostoc. The vancomycin-resistant staphylococcal mutant gave no signal with the vanA or vanB DNA probes and contained no detectable D-lactate terminating cell wall precursors. The biochemical mechanism and clinical significance of such glycopeptide-resistant mutants remained to be established.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ramoplanin (a novel lipoglycopeptide), vancomycin, and teicoplanin against gram-positive clinical isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of ramoplanin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against Gram-positive organisms isolated from cancer patients were determined. Ramoplanin was the most active agent tested inhibiting all isolates at a concentration of < or = 0.5 mg/L. Although all isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin, their activities were surpassed by that of ramoplanin. The activity of teicoplanin was moderately better than that of vancomycin against Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and most streptococcal isolates, and was comparable to vancomycin for the remainder of the isolates tested.
TI  - Influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (GPB). Previous investigations showed that the macrophage scavenger receptor (SR), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many GPB, possibly via LTA. SR binding to other ligands is dependent upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand. We therefore investigated SR recognition of LTA species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these LTAs to compete with the binding of metabolically labeled SR to beads coated with the known SR ligand polyguanylic acid. Staphylococcus aureus LTA, a classical LTA type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for inhibition of SR binding of 0.84 microg/ml. When the S. aureus LTA was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the IC50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. Other polyglycerophosphate LTAs from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria welshimeri, and Streptococcus sanguis showed IC50S of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to SR. Accordingly, the zwitterionic LTA of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Clostridium innocuum LTA substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. Monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. The data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated LTA as a major ligand of GPB for binding to SR. Whether binding of LTA and whole GPB to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Comparison of antimicrobial properties of monoterpenes and their carbonylated products.
AB  - Some monoterpenes and their carbonylated products were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. The carbonylation of tested monoterpenes was shown to increase the bacteriostatic and fungistatic activities specifically by the contact method. Concerning the killing effects, only (1R,2S,5R)-isopulegol, its carbonylated products, and (R)-carvone showed significant bactericidal activities, particularly against Enterococcus faecium and Escherichia coli above a concentration of 10 microliters/ml. A fungicidal efficiency of (1R,2S,5R)-isopulegol and (R)-carvone against Aspergillus niger was also noted. It seems that the presence of an oxygenated function in the framework increases the antimicrobial properties. However, monoterpenes were more active using a micro-atmosphere method.
TI  - Direct application of Etest to gram-positive cocci from blood cultures: quick and reliable minimum inhibitory concentration data.
AB  - The Etest was applied directly to 100 Gram-positive bacterial strains from blood  cultures to measure their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results showed 100% concordance of MIC data between a direct Etest method and the standard Etest method for Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. In addition, direct Etest for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis showed 83 to 100% correlation with standard Etests. These data indicate that the Etest is useful to obtain MIC data on Gram-positive cocci (especially streptococci) directly from positive blood cultures. The advantages of a direct Etest are two fold: MIC results can be obtained 24 hours earlier than standard methods and a more representative population of the bacterial isolate is tested.
TI  - Survival of model bacterial strains and helminth eggs in the course of mesophilic anaerobic digestion of pig slurry.
AB  - The effect of methanogenesis on the survival of model bacterial strains (Escherichia coli EC 5, Staphylococcus aureus SA 11, Enterococcus faecium CCM 4231) and non-embryonated helminth eggs (Ascaris suum) was investigated in pig slurry. Two pilot-plant experiments were carried out in two anaerobic digesters (800 and 1,000 litre) in a mesophilic thermal range (35-37 degrees C). The mean hydraulic retention time of the digesters was 20 days. The methanogenesis process was monitored by determining the following chemical parameters: pH, N-NH3, total dry matter (kg/day), organic matter (kg/day) production of methane by supplied and degraded organic matter (m3/kg). The results obtained allow us to state that the anaerobic stabilization of pig slurry in the mesophilic temperature range resulted in total devitalization of model bacterial strains E. coli EC 5 and Ent. faecium CCM 4231. St. aureus SA 11 cells, exposed to the above mentioned conditions, were also reduced in their number from 10.04 to 3.27 and from 8.69 to 2.77 log cfu/ml. It is assumed that the longer retention time of excrements in the digester could also result in total devitalization of St. aureus SA 11 cells. From the microbiological point of view, the above mentioned facts indicate a sufficient hygienization effect of the anaerobic fermentation on the contaminated pig excrements. The survival of A. suum eggs was little affected by the 20-day anaerobic mesophilic digestion of pig slurry. Only 17 or 18% (F1, F2) of the non-embryonated A. suum eggs were damaged after the 20-day exposure.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - Selective isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Broth formulations of two media selective for enterococci, Enterococcel, M-Enterococcosel broths were supplemented with 6 micrograms of vancomycin per ml and evaluated for isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Each broth was challenged with various concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and with 193 perianal specimens obtained from patients at risk in our institution for VRE colonization. Both the Enterococcosel and M-Enterococcus broths with vancomycin detected as few as 1 to 9 CFU of VRE while inhibiting growth of the other organisms tested. Enterococcus faecium organisms (MIC, > 256 micrograms/ml) were recovered from 66 perianal swab cultures in the enterococcosel-vancomycin broth, and VRE were recovered from 62 perianal swab cultures in the M-Enterococcus-vancomycin broth. Enterococcosel-vancomycin broth detected VRE in perianal specimens 48 h earlier than did M-Enterococcus-vancomycin broth. Enterococcosel broth with 6 micrograms of vancomycin per ml can be used for the rapid and selective isolation of VRE from surveillance specimens.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant endocarditis in a hemodialysis patient.
AB  - A chronic dialysis patient developed persistent bacteremia as a result of infection with Enterococcus faecium. During the patient's illness, resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin developed. Despite arteriovenous (AV) graft removal and an extensive but inconclusive search for the source of the infection, bacteremia persisted. On autopsy, the patient was found to have had aortic-valve endocarditis. Endocarditis is a well-known complication in dialysis patients. Multidrug-resistant organisms are becoming more prevalent in hospitalized patients as well. Risk factors for the development of endocarditis in dialysis patients include catheters, AV grafts, and calcific valvular disease, all in conjunction with frequent access to the circulation. Avoidance of temporary catheter use by prompt placement of AV fistulas or grafts and consideration of their early use, the meticulous care of catheters once in place, and treatment of the nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus may lower the incidence of bacteremia and therefore endocarditis in dialysis patients. The removal of infected catheters and/or AV grafts if prompt clearing of the blood with antibiotics does not occur is the next step, followed by valve replacement in selected cases. The routine use of vancomycin in the dialysis population should be reevaluated in light of the development of high-level antibiotic-resistant organisms.
TI  - Two investigational glycylcyclines, DMG-DMDOT and DMG-MINO. Antimicrobial activity studies against gram-positive species.
AB  - DMG-DMDOT (CL-331,002 OR CL-331,928) and DMG-MINO (CL-329,998 or CL-344,677) are  two new semisynthetic tetracyclines called glycylcyclines, with a broad spectrum of activity and includes Enterobacteriaceae, Gram-positive cocci, JK diphtheroids, and Bacillus cereus. Potent activity was demonstrated against all Streptococcus spp. strains [minimum inhibitory concentrations] (MIC90S) 0.06-0.25 micrograms/ml) and staphylococci (oxacillin susceptible ans resistant; MIC90S 0.12-2 micrograms/ml). Both glycylcyclines (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml) were more potent than minocycline (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml) against Enterococcus faecium, many of which were vancomycin resistant (116 strains). Organisms with minocycline MICs at > or = 8 micrograms/ml (Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and pneumococci) had glycylcycline MIC results ranging from 0.06 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (e.g., apparent use against existing tetracycline-resistance phenotypes). Drugs in this class appear promising for therapy of infections caused by Gram-positive species now testing resistant to contemporary antimicrobial agents, and further development of compounds in this class is encouraged.
TI  - Emerging resistance in clinically important gram-positive cocci.
AB  - In the first half of the decade of the 1990s, we in the United States have seen the emergence and escalation of substantial antimicrobial resistance in medically important gram-positive cocci. The incidence of methicillin resistance of Staphylococcus aureus continues to increase (now 18%), resulting in many more isolates that are multiply resistant; all S aureus isolates are still susceptible to vancomycin. Enterococci, particularly Enterococcus faecium, have increasingly developed resistance to penicillin, gentamicin, streptomycin, and vancomycin (the last plasmid-mediated). More than a fourth of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains are now resistant to penicillin, and these strains tend to be multiply resistant, including to cephalosporins and macrolides.
TI  - Future prospects and therapeutic potential of streptogramins.
AB  - Dramatic changes in the epidemiology and susceptibility patterns of Gram-positive cocci during the last decade have mandated new approaches to the management of many bacterial infections. For example, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, particularly those resistant to methicillin (MRSA), and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly those associated with foreign bodies and indwelling medical devices. Additionally, the worldwide spread of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to penicillin and macrolides, and the emergence of enterococci (particularly Enterococcus faecium) resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and other antibiotics, present further therapeutic problems. New antibacterial agents are urgently required to meet the challenges posed by these epidemiological trends. The semisynthetic streptogramins, a unique class of antibacterials currently under development, offer promise in the treatment of such multiresistant infections. Possible future applications include treatment of infections caused by the following organisms: MRSA, enterococci resistant to vancomycin, macrolides or lincosamides; and beta-lactam-resistant streptococci. They may also prove useful as therapy for children with staphylococcal infection and patients with multiresistant infections who are unable to tolerate vancomycin, including patients with skin and soft tissue infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, patients with osteomyelitis, foreign body associated infections, endocarditis and sepsis due to Gram-positive bacteria. Clinical trials are required to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of streptogramins in these settings.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the 1990s.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. This chapter reviews the epidemiology of this resistance, its detection in the laboratory, the mechanisms of resistance, and the options for therapy and infection control.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of new 2-substituted penem antibiotics.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three new penems with 4-hydroxyprolinamide, 1-prolinamide and N-methyl-N-2-propionamide substituents, respectively, in position 2 and of their stereoisomers were examined against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All substitutes conferred a broad antibacterial spectrum on the penem moiety. Changes in stereoisomerism selectively improved the activity against E. coli, S. aureus or enterococci. The structure-activity relationships of each compound were discussed in relation to minimum inhibitory concentrations, penicillin-binding protein (PBP) affinity and outer membrane permeability coefficient in E. coli. In this microorganism, PBP 2 was the target for all compounds. Changes in stereoisomerism influenced the affinity for PBPs 1A/B and 2. All antibiotics easily permeated the outer membrane of E. coli and, within each group of compounds, the penetration rate correlated with the antibacterial activity.
TI  - [The end of antibiotics? Increasing bacterial resistance in global and Norwegian  perspective].
AB  - During the last 20 years there has emerged a growing world-wide problem with regard to multidrug-resistant microbes. The most serious examples so far are vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium, totally resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and multiple-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. With the exception of some few strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, such bacteria have not been found in Norway. In this article we discuss possible ways of preventing further selection and spread of multiple-resistant microbes. We stress the importance of infection control programmes and restrictive use of antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activities of the lichen secondary metabolites vulpinic acid, (+)-usnic  acid, and (-)-usnic acid against aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
AB  - Secondary metabolites of different species of lichen were tested for their activities against a variety of microbial species. While gram-negative rods and fungi were not inhibited by these compounds, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and some anaerobic species (Bacteroides and Clostridium species) were susceptible at the concentrations tested. Vulpinic acid generally was less active than usnic acid, regardless of its stereochemistry. The susceptibility to usnic acid was not impaired in clinical isolates of S. aureus resistant to methicillin and/or mupirocin.
TI  - Susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  - The significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. Furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. We evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 S. epidermidis, 52 S. haemolyticus, 10 S. saprophyticus, 10 S. hominis, 4 S. warneri, 4 S. simulans, 4 S. capitis and 14 S. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49 E. faecalis, 1 E. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. The data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the results from the E test and the agar disk diffusion test. Concerning vancomycin, no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (E. faecium) proved to be resistant. The overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 S. haemolyticus, 1 S. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of S. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. Teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. For vancomycin, a very close correlation between the MICs from the agar dilution test and the E test was noticed. As concerns teicoplanin, the MICs from the E-test were usually somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. No correlation was found between the MICs of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. For routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the MIC (e.g., by the E test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than the agar disk diffusion test.
TI  - Characteristics of enterococci and staphylococci isolated from the crop and caecum of Japanese quails exposed to microgravity conditions.
AB  - Ten selected strains of enterococci and staphylococci were isolated from the crop and caecum of Japanese quails exposed to microgravity conditions. Isolates were allotted to the species Enterococcus gallinarum, Ent. avium, Ent. faecium, Staphylococcus gallinarum and Staph. aureus. Isolated strains were facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, Gram-positive cocci, occurring in pairs, short chains or irregular clusters. Isolates utilized most of the soluble sugars tested and produced bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococci and staphylococci were resistant to monensin (50 mg/l) and sensitive to tylosin and virginiamycin (10 mg/l).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. CS-940 activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90S, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml). CS-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. CS-940 was also very active against Streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which MIC90S were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecium, however, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. CS-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. This compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of WY-49605, a penem antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the penem antimicrobial WY-49605 was compared with those of other agents available for oral administration. Based on concentrations inhibiting 90% of isolates (MIC(90)s), the penem inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC(90) = 0.25 microg/ml), penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC(90) < or = 0.12 microg/ml) and several other Gram-positive genera at concentrations comparable or superior to the most active comparison agents. WY-49605 and cefpodoxime were the most active agents against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Most strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to the new agent at concentrations < or =4microg/ml, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to all agents tested.
TI  - Conjugative mobilization of a vancomycin resistance plasmid by a putative Enterococcus faecium sex pheromone response plasmid.
AB  - Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that horizontal gene transfer may be an  important mechanism for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. A filter mating survey of 21 VanA Enterococcus faecium isolates from The New York Hospital showed that 14 of these isolates transferred vancomycin resistance (Vmr) to the plasmid-free reference strain Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2. One isolate, E. faecium R7, was selected for further study based on its ability to transfer Vmr to strain JH2-2 in liquid culture. Analysis of the plasmid content of transconjugants revealed three general classes. The predominant class (28 of 47 transconjugants) contained two separate plasmids: pHKK702 and pHKK703. pHKK702 is a 41-kb plasmid that contains an element indistinguishable from the Vmr transposon Tn1546 and an element that hybridizes with an ermB probe from the Staphylococcus aureus erythromycin resistance transposon Tn551. pHKK703 is a 55-kb plasmid that hybridizes with probes for the sex pheromone response genes prgA, prgB, and prgX derived from the E. faecalis plasmid pCF10. The second group of transconjugants (18 of 47) contained various recombinant forms of pHKK702 and pHKK703, whereas a third transconjugant class contained only pHKK702 (1 of 47). Transconjugants that contained both pHKK702 and pHKK703 were able to efficiently transfer Vmr to recipient strains in broth or on filters. However, no transfer of Vmr was detected using the donor containing only pHKK702. The transfer of Vmr from the recombination-deficient derivative of E. faecalis JH2-2 [strain UV202(pHKK702, pHKK703)] was reduced 600-fold compared to that of JH2-2(pHKK702, pHKK703). We propose that pHKK703 functions as an E. faecium sex pheromone response plasmid that conjugatively mobilizes pHKK702, and that a major pathway for this mobilization may require donor-mediated recombination proficiency. This report provides the first example in which a plasmid containing a Tn1546-related element is conjugatively mobilized.
TI  - New threats to the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Several countries have achieved considerable success in the control of epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, in several hospitals in the UK, MRSA strains of enhanced epidemicity, notably EMRSA-16, are becoming endemic. Our inability to eliminate the cause of a single-strain outbreak is unfamiliar and unnerving. Factors in 'market-led' health care delivery that hinder control of MRSA include a shortage of inpatient beds, patients moving from ward to ward, and more mixed-specialty wards. Increasing use of day treatments leaves an inpatient hospital population with more risk factors for infection. Early discharge of infected patients to convalescent homes, or to homes for the elderly, has created a new reservoir of infected and colonized patients. The emergence of high-level mupirocin resistance may soon also contribute to failure of control. The transfer of vancomycin resistance from Enterococcus faecium to a laboratory strain of S. aureus suggests that, especially in hospitals with both vancomycin-resistant enterococci and MRSA, there is the opportunity for the emergence of vancomycin-resistant MRSA for which there may be no effective antimicrobial prophylaxis or treatment. It is increasingly important to persuade hospital managers that even partial control of MRSA, whilst expensive, is still cost-effective and is a quality issue for individual hospitals. The control of EMRSA-16 in one hospital has recently been estimated to have saved more than 629,000 pounds extra costs. MRSA continues to be at the forefront of those organisms that seriously challenge modern technological medicine and surgery.
TI  - Bacterial and fungal infections after liver transplantation: an analysis of 284 patients.
AB  - A prospective study of bacterial and fungal infections after liver transplantation in 284 adults was undertaken. One hundred seventy-five (62%) became infected; bacterial or fungal infections occurred in 159 (56%) and 36 (13%) patients, respectively. Gram-positive cocci, in particular Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, were the commonest bacterial pathogens, and bacteremia and wound infection were the most frequent bacterial infections. Acute rejection and prolonged admission were independent risk factors for bacterial infection; pretransplantation antibacterials had a protective effect. Fungal infection most frequently involved the urinary tract and chest; Candida albicans was the most common pathogen. Four independent variables predicted fungal infection: low pretransplantation hemoglobin, high pretransplantation bilirubin, return to surgery, and prolonged therapy with ciprofloxacin. Patients with acute liver failure were more prone to bacterial, but not fungal, infection. No associations were found between infections and duration of surgery. Bacterial, and to a lesser extent, fungal infections are important complications of liver transplantation. However, liver transplantation surgery per se may not be the major determinant of infection.
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. These compounds are potent bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring juncture. ABT-719 is an S isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. ABT-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. ABT-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The racemate and R forms of ABT-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The 50% effective doses of ABT-719 were at least threefold lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. In immunosuppressed mice, ABT-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacokinetic properties of ABT-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. The 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - [Microbial resistance to formaldehyde. III> Dependence of the microbial effect on Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus on temperature].
AB  - Temperature dependence of microbicidal efficacy of formaldehyde was examined with suspension tests (pH 7.0). Test germs were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus. The methodology was nearly the same as in previous investigations (5, 7). At given exposure periods and temperatures formaldehyde concentrations necessary to produce a microbicidal effect of log (N/N0) = -4.0 (concentrations of equal efficacy) were determined. N and N0 represent the numbers of colony-forming units in suspensions with and without formaldehyde, respectively. On rectangular graphic representation with the reciprocal value of absolute temperature on the abscissa and with the logarithm of the formaldehyde concentration on the ordinate, the formaldehyde concentrations of equal efficacy fitted straight lines. Lines referring to different exposure periods nearly paralleled each other. With increasing exposure periods the steepness of the lines decreased slightly. This effect was most pronounced with Staphylococcus aureus as a test germ. The ratio of formaldehyde concentrations of equal efficacy for exposure periods of 120 minutes at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively, was 3.1:1 with Staphylococcus aureus, and 2.8:1 with Enterococcus faecium. The corresponding ratio obtained with spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus and referring to 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C, respectively, was 3.6:1. The logarithms of these ratios decreased with temperature in the same measure as the pertinent absolute temperatures increased. On the basis of the previously presented three-dimensional model of the relations between concentration, period of action and efficacy of microbicidal agents, it could be shown that deviations of the results from a linear and parallel course reflect an inconstant concentration exponent. When low formaldehyde concentration, long exposure period and "high" temperature coincide, the efficacy of formaldehyde is lower than calculated for a linear and parallel course of the relation.
TI  - Heterogeneity of the vanA gene cluster in clinical isolates of enterococci from the northeastern United States.
AB  - In several strains of Enterococcus faecium isolated in Europe, the cluster of genes encoding high-level resistance to vancomycin (VanA phenotype) resides on a 10.85-kb transposon, Tn1546, or closely related elements. To determine whether Tn1546 was conserved in recent enterococcal isolates from the northeastern United States, seven strains were compared by restriction mapping and DNA hybridization with probes from within the van cluster. Two of the seven strains contained intact Tn1546-like sequences; however, in five of the strains, the organization of the van cluster differed from that of Tn1546. Three of the five strains with variations harbored a novel DNA segment within the van gene cluster. This 1,496-bp segment was similar to IS1165 of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and IS1181 of Staphylococcus aureus and was flanked by 24- and 23-bp imperfect inverted repeats and 8-bp direct repeats. On the basis of these findings, we propose that this element comprises a novel insertion-like sequence, IS1251. Multiple copies of IS1251 were also present at other sites in both resistant and susceptible clinical isolates. Our findings suggest that the van cluster in recent isolates from the northeastern United States differs from that present in the early European VanA phenotype strains.
TI  - [The present and future problems of resistance in staphylococci, streptococci and M. tuberculosis].
AB  - Mechanisms of resistance of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. The resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in S. aureus and S. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of DNA, namely by gene mecA. This gene codes altered PBP-2A protein. Strains of S.pneumoniae contain PBP-1A, PBP-2B and PBP-2X proteins. They cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium is coded by transferable vanA and vanB genes. Strains of N. meningitidis produce mostly the altered PBP-2 protein. The increase of resistance in strains of M. tuberculosis is also significant.
TI  - [Evaluation of the disinfectant activity of the compound VIRKON].
AB  
TI  - Everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (SCH) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria. Everninomicin showed the highest activity against the species tested and MICs90% of everninomicin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 0.78 microgram/ml. Laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very slow rate. Post-antibiotic effect against strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. Adherence to glass surface of an MRSA strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub MIC of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.
TI  - A universal approach to bacterial molecular epidemiology by polymerase chain reaction ribotyping.
AB  - Oligonucleotide primers complementary to conserved regions of the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA genes were used to amplify the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region of bacterial pathogens. The amplification patterns produced were compared for their potential use in molecular epidemiologic analysis. This method, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping, was applied to isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter species. Length polymorphisms in the amplified DNA distinguished unrelated strains of all bacteria. The banding patterns of 3 S. aureus isolates from the blood of 1 patient on 3 consecutive days were identical. Plasmid analysis, biotyping, and antibiograms were also obtained on the Enterobacter isolates. All three of these methods showed considerable variability after in vitro passage of bacteria, but PCR ribotypes remained stable. Results demonstrate the utility of the conserved primers for PCR ribotyping, a widely applicable method for the molecular epidemiology of genetically diverse bacteria.
TI  - Resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-positive bacteria has reemerged in the last decade as a major clinical problem. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and enterococci resistant to penicillin, vancomycin, and/or gentamicin have become new considerations in the selection of therapy. Both mutation and acquisition of new DNA on either the chromosome or plasmids can be responsible for resistance in Gram-positive species. Because therapies are often limited, renewed efforts are needed to understand the epidemiology in order to effect control.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Prevalence of important pathogens and antimicrobial activity of parenteral drugs  at numerous medical centers in the United States, I. Study on the threat of emerging resistances: real or perceived? Fluoroquinolone Resistance Surveillance Group.
AB  - Forty-three medical centers participated in a national (United States) surveillance study of parenteral antimicrobial agents as empiric therapy of pathogens isolated from blood, skin wounds, respiratory tract, and urine (> 8500 strains, 200 per laboratory). All laboratories tested each organism by the same reagent disks and/or Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) strips. Quality control results validated all laboratories for analyses. The most common isolates were Escherichia coli (1648), Staphylococcus aureus (1408), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1003), Klebsiella species (792), and the enterococci (684). Among the tested drugs the percent susceptible rates observed were ofloxacin (83.4%), ciprofloxacin (82.0%), and cefuroxime (62.9%) tested against all organisms; cefazolin (54.7%) and ceftazidime (76.7%) tested against all nonfastidious aerobes; gentamicin (91.2%), imipenem (95.3%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (78.2%), and ceftriaxone (66.2%) tested against Gram-negative organisms only; and vancomycin (97.9%) and erythromycin (49.2%) tested against Gram-positive aerobes. Several drug-resistant species appear to be emerging or increasing in the United States: (a) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (7.9%, mostly Enterococcus faecium); (b) oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (21.0%); (c) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and Klebsiella species with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (approximately 1.3%-8.6%); (d) penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.8%); and (e) ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (14.9%). Fluoroquinolone resistance among the enteric bacilli was confirmed in 60 of 66 referred strains (0.8% of total strains), and cross-resistance was high among ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin (98.3%-100%). Seventeen strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacilli (0.2% of total) also harbored an ESBL and resistance to aminoglycosides. Clonal spread within medical centers was observed with the ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. This national clinical isolate data base continues to demonstrate broad fluoroquinolone efficacy (ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin) against hospital-based pathogens and many strains of emerging resistant bacteria. Continued US surveillance studies are urged to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance and to guide interventions to minimize its occurrence.
TI  - [Method of DNA extraction and mecA, femA and PBP2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  - Recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. At first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of DNA extraction. N-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract DNA from E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. aureus, respectively. After achromopeptidase extraction, the mecA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinically isolated MRSA (95 strains), MSSA (66), MRSE (methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 37), MSSE (methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis, 1), S haemolyticus(5), S.hominis(1) and others (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus, total 45). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The positive rates were 95% (MRSA), 1.5% (MSSA), and 97% (MRSE). The mecA gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant S.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive S.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.hominis. The mecA gene was not detected in 45 non-Staphylococcal strains. MecA and femA gene by PCR and PBP 2' by IRMA were further detected in newly isolated MRSA (20 strains), MSSA(20), MRSE(14), MSSE(1) and S.simulans(2). Complete correlation between MPIPC susceptibility and mecA were found. The femA gene was positive in 39/40 of S. aureus, and 0/14 of S.epidermidis, 2/3 of S.simulans. PBP2' were positive in 20/20 of MRSA, 0/20 of MSSA, 14/14 of MRSE, 0/1 of MSSE, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive S.simulans. In conclusion, diagnoses of MRSA by simultaneous detection of mecA and femA gene as well as PBP2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.
TI  - Identification of gram positive cocci isolated from urine.
AB  - A total of 195 strains of Gram positive cocci isolated from urine, in pure culture and in counts of > 10(3) colony forming units/ml, during January-September 1992, were speciated using schema recently described by Facklam and Washington, and Kloos and Lambe. Seventy three (85%) of the 86 enterococci were identified as Enterococcus faecalis while 11 (13%) were E. faecium. Eighteen (29%) of the 62 staphylococcal isolates were Staphylococcus aureus; 20 (45%) of the 44 coagulase negative staphylococci were speciated as Staph. haemolyticus. Of the 47 strains of beta haemolytic streptococci isolated, 45 (96%) were group B; one was group G and the other group F. Our results show the diverse species of Gram positive cocci associated with bacteriuria and the need to speciate them in a diagnostic laboratory. In the context of a larger number of tests required for the speciation of Gram positive cocci, we recommend a simplified scheme which we found feasible on a routine basis.
TI  - [Bacteria-reducing properties of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. II. Relationship between microbiocide effect of copper-containing materials and copper ion concentration after contamination with moist and dry hands].
AB  - The bactericide quality of different materials containing copper (copper, brass,  brass-sheet) was tested and particularly the effect of humidity and copper-concentration was examined. In first examinations (I. communication) (19) the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined after defined exposure times (0, 5, 30, 60, 120 min). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. In this examination the results were tested for statistical significance and in parallel experiments the copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials was determined. Materials containing copper contaminated with wet hands show a significant bactericide effect after an exposure time of 120 min. The bactericide effect on Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is inhibited after contamination with dry hands. This results can not be explained by a different copper-concentration on the surfaces of the materials, because a statistically significant difference of copper-ion concentrations between contamination with wet and dry hands could not be obtained.
TI  - In vitro activities of two glycylcyclines.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, CL 329,998 and CL 331,002 (two new semisynthetic tetracyclines), were evaluated in comparison with those of tetracycline and other available oral antimicrobial agents. A total of 523 recent clinical isolates were studied, including strains resistant to tetracycline. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were generally > or = 16-fold more susceptible to the glycylcyclines than to tetracycline (although less difference was seen with Proteus spp.). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was modestly susceptible to both new compounds (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 16 micrograms/ml). Tetracycline- and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus were all susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 1 microgram/ml). Streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium displayed a bimodal distribution of susceptibility to tetracycline yet were uniformly susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). The glycylcyclines were highly potent against Neisseria, Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Bacteroides spp. (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). Strains of Chlamydia spp. (three C. trachomatis strains and one C. pneumoniae strain) were inhibited by < or = 0.25 microgram of CL 329,998 or CL 331,002 per ml. Two strains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 0.12 microgram of CL 331,002 per ml and by 1 microgram of CL 329,998 per ml. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were resistant to the two glycylcyclines (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that the two glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - [Determination of the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to plycopeptides by the E-test method].
AB  - E-test was evaluated by comparison with the reference agar dilution method on 15  enterococci and 15 staphylococci with variable resistance to glycopeptides and isolated from clinical samples: 15 enterococci with 3 glycopeptide-resistant (2 E. facalis and 1 E. faecium), 1 glycopeptide intermediate E. gallinarum and 11 glycopeptide-sensible E. faecalis; 15 staphylococci with 4 teicoplanine-resistant (1 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 2 S. hominis), 3 teicoplanin-intermediate (1 S. epidermidis, 2 S. haemolyticus) and 8 teicoplanin sensible strains (6 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 1 S. hominis). Repeatability (10 determinations by strain) and exactitude were tested for all strains. Our data shows very good results for repeatability and exactitude with the reference method except in the case of coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanin. Some technical problems appear in our experience: for staphylococci, a 48 h incubation is necessary to detect teicoplanin-intermediate strains but 24 h is sufficient for enterococci. E-test is expensive, require a strict methodology, but is a good method to detect glycopeptide resistance for staphylococci and enterococci except for coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanine.
TI  - Differences in the sensitivity to eight disinfectants of Listeria monocytogenes strains as related to their origin (short note).
AB  - The efficacy of eight commercialized disinfectants proposed by several manufacturers was evaluated using the French standard in the presence of organic matter and against Listeria monocytogenes and L. innocua strains isolated in a dairy plant, against other Listeria strains of various origin and reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Products containing quaternary ammonium plus peroxide or amine were shown to be efficient at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. Differences in sensitivities were noticed for one disinfectant containing chlorine.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effect of FK-037 and biapenem tested against five bacterial species.
AB  - The in-vitro post-antibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for two newer beta-lactams, FK-037 (a cephalosporin) and biapenem (a carbapenem). Our PAE results for these drugs were consistent with what has been reported previously for similar beta-lactams, e.g. Gram-positive organisms had measurable effects (0.4-2.2 hours), while Gram-negatives had variable results (0.0 to 1.4 hours). Even though the PAE test conditions generally coincided with achievable clinical levels for most organisms tested (< or = 4 mg/L for biapenem and < or = 8 mg/L for FK-037), the marginal or species dependent, short PAE values support the selection of multiple daily doses (two-to-four) based on conventional pharmacokinetic parameters such as the Cmax, AUC, and serum elimination half-life.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of broad spectrum quinolones against clinical  bacterial isolates].
AB  - In vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (SPFX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), lomefloxacin (LFLX), fleroxacin (FLRX), and levofloxacin (LVFX) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Antibacterial activities of SPFX, CPFX, and LVFX against Gram-negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, M. (B) catarrhalis and H. influenzae were better than those of FLRX and LFLX. SPFX showed the highest activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. However, strains showed high MIC (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to SPFX were found among MRSA, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.
TI  - Potentiation of antibiotic activity by EDTA-tromethamine against three clinically isolated gram-positive resistant bacteria. An in vitro investigation.
AB  - The in vitro synergistic effects of combinations of EDTA-tromethamine and five antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, cephalexin, oxytetracycline, streptomycin and sulphadimethoxine) on three clinically isolated Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and Streptococcus faecium) were investigated. The bacteria had been isolated from three cases of canine otitis resistant to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration for the antibiotics alone or in combination with EDTA-tromethamine. EDTA-tromethamine potentiated the activity of cefalexin against S. aureus and S. hominis, of oxytetracycline against S. aureus and S. faecium and of streptomycin against S. faecium. No significant effects were noted on the activity of oxytetracycline against S. hominis. The remaining combinations gave a slight synergistic effect. As previously shown for Gram-negative resistant bacteria, these data suggest that the association of EDTA-tromethamine and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be useful to overcome persistent infections of soft tissues in domestic animals.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria from nursing home residents in Oklahoma.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities for 2,832 isolates from nursing home patients in Oklahoma (1992) were compiled retrospectively. An appreciable proportion of antimicrobial resistance was detected for ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin among gram-negative bacilli. Of 301 Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, 70% were resistant to methicillin and 72% resistant to ciprofloxacin. Vancomycin resistance occurred in 22% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. These findings herald a high incidence of antimicrobial resistance in nursing home residents.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the glycylcyclines, a new class  of semisynthetic tetracyclines.
AB  - N,N-Dimethylglycylamido (DMG) derivatives of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline are new semisynthetic tetracyclines referred to as the glycylcyclines. The in vitro activities of the glycylcyclines were evaluated in comparison with those of minocycline and tetracycline against strains carrying characterized tetracycline resistance determinants and against 995 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers in North America. The glycylcyclines were active against tetracycline-resistant strains carrying efflux [tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), and tet(D) in Escherichia coli and tet(K) in Staphylococcus aureus] and ribosomal protection [tet(M) in S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. coli)] resistance determinants. Potent activity (MIC for 90% of strains, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) was obtained with the glycylcyclines against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, E. faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and various streptococcal species. The glycylcyclines exhibited good activity against a wide diversity of gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most of which were less susceptible to minocycline and tetracycline. The activities of the glycylcyclines against most organisms tested were comparable to each other. The in vivo efficacies of the glycylcyclines against acute lethal infections in mice when dosed intravenously were reflective of their in vitro activities. The glycylcyclines had efficacies comparable to that of minocycline against infections with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, a strain carrying tet(K), and a tetracycline-susceptible E. coli strain but exceeded the effectiveness of minocycline against infections with resistant isolates, including strains harboring tet(M) or tet(B). Levels of DMG-6-deoxytetracycline in serum were higher and more sustained than those of DMG-minocycline or minocycline. Our results show that the glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many resistant strains. On the basis of their in vitro and in vivo activities, the glycylcyclines represent a significant advance to the tetracycline class of antibiotics and have good potential value for clinical efficacy.
TI  - [Bacterial reducing qualities of copper-containing and non-copper-containing materials. I. Contamination and sedimentation in humid and dry conditions].
AB  - In this examination the bactericide qualities of different materials were tested. Particularly the effect of humidity was examined. 3 materials containing copper ("copper", "brass" and "brass sheet") and 2 materials not containing copper ("polyamide B" and "high-grade steel") were tested. The surfaces of the 5 types of material were contaminated with a suspension of 2 different bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus). After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined by the standardized method of the "Guidelines of the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology". Additionally the sedimentation of airborne microorganisms on the materials was tested by determining the number of colony-forming-units after defined exposure times. In further examinations the materials were contaminated by hands, which were dipped into a suspension of different microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The following ways of contaminating the test materials were chosen: single contamination with wet hands, repeated contamination with wet and dry hands. After defined exposure times the survival rate of the microorganisms on the surfaces was determined. The results show, a bactericide quality of copper depends on the percent of copper-content of the tested materials, exposure time, humidity, frequency of contamination and bacteria species. Humidity and only single contamination cause a reduction of bacteria. Reduction of gram-negative bacteria is more easily than reduction of gram-positive bacteria. Enterococcus faecium shows the highest, Pseudomonas aeruginosa the lowest reduction rate of bacteria in the following sequence: Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Identification of the satA gene encoding a streptogramin A acetyltransferase in Enterococcus faecium BM4145.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium BM4145, a clinical isolate from urine, was resistant to streptogramin group A antibiotics by inactivation. The strain harbored a plasmid containing a gene, satA, responsible for this resistance; this gene was cloned and sequenced. It encoded SatA, a protein deduced to be 23,634 Da in mass and homologous with a new family of chloramphenicol acetyltransferases described in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The similarity of SatA to other acetyltransferases, LacA (thiogalactoside acetyltransferase) and CysE (serine acetyltransferase) from E. coli, and to two putative acetyltransferases, NodL from Rhizobium leguminosarum and Urf1 from E. coli, was also observed in a region considered to be the enzyme's active site. Acetylation experiments indicated that acetyl coenzyme A was necessary for SatA activity and that a single acetylated derivative of pristinamycin IIA was produced. Other members of the streptogramin A group such as virginiamycin M and RP54476 were also substrates for the enzyme. We conclude that resistance to the streptogramin A group of antibiotics in E. faecium BM4145 is due to acetylation by an enzyme related to the novel chloramphenicol acetyltransferase family.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefpirome and 6 other beta-lactam antibacterial agents against clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome (CPR) was compared with that of cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ) and imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 384 clinical isolates, for tested by the both microdilution method. The activity of CPR against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50, 1 microgram/ml) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50, 8 micrograms/ml) was better than CTX and CAZ, but slightly less than IPM/CS. CPR and other antibacterial agents were not effect against methicillin resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecium. The activity of CPR against Enterobacteriaceae was as good as that of CTX, CAZ, and IPM/CS, and more effective than CEZ, CTM and FMOX. The MIC50 of CPR for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2 micrograms/ml) and the MIC50 of CPR for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 micrograms/ml) were as good as that of CAZ. Conclusionly, CPR was a new broad spectrum cephalosporin as compared with used cephalosporins.
TI  - Taurolidine: in vitro activity against multiple-antibiotic-resistant, nosocomially significant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and diverse Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Taurolidine at < or = 1,250 micrograms/ml killed all 37 isolates of multiple-antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Enterococcus faecium (n = 17), and Enterobacteriaceae (n = 11). Time-kill experiments disclosed that bovine serum (65% v/v) only marginally retarded the bactericidal activity of 2,000 and 1,000 micrograms/ml of taurolidine against the various strains. Taurolidine at 2,000 micrograms/ml did not antagonize the bactericidal activity of 50% (v/v) fresh human serum against promptly and delayed serum-sensitive test strains of Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. In the presence of 65% (v/v) of fresh defibrinated human blood from two donors, however, the bactericidal activity of this antimicrobial compound was delayed, i.e., manifested only following extended (overnight) incubation, against staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates, though less so in the case of Enterobacteriaceae. Taurolidine at 2,000 micrograms/ml killed ingested, i.e., intraphagocytic bacteria of human-serum-resistant S. marcescens strains CDC 06:H3 and P016:H-.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of enterococci: results of a survey conducted by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme for Microbiology.
AB  - Six strains of enterococci were distributed to participants in the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme for Microbiology with a request that they be tested for susceptibility to ampicillin/penicillin and vancomycin and for high-level resistance to gentamicin. More than 98% of laboratories correctly reported the resistant strains as resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. However, there was a poorer correlation for the susceptible strains, with only 1-6% and 69-83% of laboratories reporting the strains as susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin respectively. Those laboratories which used 5-25 micrograms ampicillin discs or breakpoint methods reported proportionally more results correctly for the susceptible strains than those using 2 micrograms discs. Participants using Escherichia coli or an enterococcus as a control and those not using a control at all were more likely to report ampicillin-susceptible strains correctly than those using Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 (Oxford strain). For vancomycin-susceptible and high-level vancomycin-resistant strains, 93-96% and 96-99% of reports respectively were correct. For the low-level vancomycin-resistant strains, only 50-54% of reports were correct. Participants using a 5 micrograms vancomycin disc reported proportionally more of the low-level resistant strains correctly than those using 10, 20, 25, 30 or 100 micrograms discs. Participants not using controls were proportionally more likely to report the low-level resistant strains as susceptible than those using an enterococcus or S. aureus NCTC 6571 as a control. For the high-level gentamicin-resistant (HLGR) strains, 96-98% of reports were correct. Depending on the strain, between 12% and 41% of participants also reported high-level resistance for the strains which were not HLGR. Those using low-content discs (< or = 30 micrograms) and breakpoint or MIC methods were more likely to report strains which were not HLGR as HLGR than those using high-content discs. Those using an enterococcus as a control were less likely to report strains which were not HLGR as HLGR than those using either S. aureus NCTC 6571 or E. coli as a control and those not using a control.
TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Enterococci are frequently encountered in urinary, biliary, and gastrointestinal  tract infections and are increasingly being recognized in nosocomial bacteriuria and bacteremia. Undoubtedly, however, the most serious of all enterococcal infections is endocarditis. At present, enterococci are the third most common cause of infective endocarditis (after streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus), and the incidence of the disease is likely to grow as the population ages and increasing numbers of persons are placed at risk by degenerative valve disease and by predisposition to enterococcal infections through portals such as the genitourinary tract. The case presented here exemplifies many features of enterococcal endocarditis. It also illustrates the therapeutic issues and dilemmas faced in managing this disorder. Although a transesophageal approach (Figure 1) has increased the sensitivity of echocardiography for detecting valvular abnormalities in infective endocarditis, diagnosis continues to rely on blood cultures--which raises the question of how long antimicrobial therapy should be delayed for collection of blood samples. Since enterococcal isolates are often resistant to antibiotics, therapy is based on synergistic drug combinations.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - [Intestinal flora of inpatients and isolation frequency of methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - The authors compared intestinal flora from 30 healthy volunteers and 128 inpatients. E. coli, B. fragilis, and Bifidobacterium were each detected in the stools of healthy subjects at a frequency of more than 90%, while the incidences of such flora were low in the stools of inpatients: A significant difference was observed between the two groups. E. faecium, P. aeruginosa, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), C. difficile, and Candida were detected at high frequencies in the stools of inpatients, as compared with healthy subjects. This finding is attributed to the administration of antimicrobial agents. It is also considered that microbial interaction in maintaining the balance among normal intestinal flora had been lost in patients from whom MRSA and/or C. difficile was isolated. The decrease or elimination of bacterial species antagonistic to such resistant strains must be guarded against, because this can lead to weakening of the defence mechanism against intestinal infection.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The Antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (ASPC) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (MICs) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (PCs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout Japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. The MIC80's of ASPC against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. A trend for increasing susceptibility to PCs including ASPC was observed in the isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. This trend in S. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of MRSA. The trend for the increased susceptibility in H. influenzae was related to the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. The frequency of the strains highly resistant to PCs including ASPC increased. 4. No PCs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while among alpha-streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to PCs or those with resistant to PCs. These strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Meanwhile, a high frequency of highly PCs-resistant strains were noted among Enterococcus faecium. In view of the fact that the PCs-resistance of E. faecium is known to be related to PBPs, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.
TI  - [Chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol combination. In vitro study of interactions observed against potential cutaneous strains].
AB  - The interaction type of chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol association (foaming solution DC 102/1, Laboratoires Pierre Fabre Medicament) have been studied according to the chess-board method, on microplate, by determining MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) (or MFC (Minimal Fungicidal Concentrations)) adjusted to T 72-150 AFNOR norm (dilution-neutralization, contact 5 mn) and computation of FBC (or FFC) Index. Trials were carried out against 18 hospital strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans) and against 4 strains of the AF-NOR norm. MBC of chlorhexidine, against Staphylococci were included between 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, and between 25 and 200 micrograms/ml against the others strains. MBC of chlorocresol were included between 800 and 3,200 micrograms/ml. Against the 22 tested strains, 18 synergistic interactions (FBC Index < or = 0.75) were observed, with 4 to 8 reducing factor for chlorhexidine, and > or = 2 for chlorocresol. No antagonism was noted (maximal FBC Index = 1).
TI  - Infection problems for the 1990's--do we have an answer?
AB  - There is and has been continued change in organisms causing infection in the hospital. In the past few years, although Gram-negative bacteria have remained a major cause of mortality, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi have become increasingly important. This has caused organisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, Xanthomonas maltophilia and multiply resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa to be common pathogens. Can this difficult state of affairs be changed by better antimicrobial prescribing practices? Yes and no. Virtually any agent will select MRSA and MRSE since the chromosomal location of the resistance of multiple-antibiotics makes such selection common and explains the rapid rate of the fluoroquinolones as therapy of MRSA. Restriction of oral vancomycin will markedly reduce the pressure to select Enterococcus faecium and thus limit the spread of the organisms and delay transmission of glycopeptide resistance to S. aureus. Judicious use of antibiotics in the intensive care environment will be major factor in "saving" antibiotics for other patients since the ICU patient goes to other parts of the hospital carrying with him/her the baggage of resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, klebsiella, P. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacter, xanthomonas and Pseudomonas cepacia. All of these organisms have the potential to become resistant to the agents heretofore used to treat them and are common in ICU patients.
TI  - Occurrence and mechanisms of glycopeptide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Despite belief that the unique mechanism of glycopeptide action would preclude the development of resistance in susceptible organisms, clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci resistant to these compounds have been described. Among the enterococci, there are at least three types of resistance. Type A (high-level) resistance was described in Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis. It is inducible and mediated by elaboration and/or increased activity of at least three enzymes: a ligase, a dehydrogenase, and a carboxypeptidase, which orchestrate the production of peptidoglycan precursors that do not bind vancomycin. Type B (low-level) resistance described in E. faecium is also mediated by increased carboxypeptidase activity and, possibly, by elaboration of a protein detectable after incubation in vancomycin whose function is unknown. Type C resistance is associated with production of a ligase constitutively produced, chromosomally encoded, and unique to E. gallinarum. Among the staphylococci, coagulase-negative clinical isolates were obtained that were resistant to glycopeptides and one coagulase-positive isolate was resistant to teicoplanin but the mechanism of resistance is unknown. Additionally, coagulase-positive staphylococci resistant to glycopeptides have been prepared in the laboratory. They produce an approximately 39-kDa cytoplasmic protein, whose function is unknown, and have undergone extensive reorganization of their cell surface. The era in which universal gram-positive susceptibility to glycopeptides can be presumed is over; susceptibility testing must now accompany isolation of an enterococcus or staphylococcus of clinical importance.
TI  - [The effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  - Some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. Staphylococcus cohnii SC7, Staphylococcus sp. ZTJ 151, S. saprophyticus SS 877, Enterococcus faecium EF1 and E. faecalis EFG2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves and fallow deer, Enterococcus gallinarum EG10 and E. avium EA12 were isolated from the caecum of Japanese quail. The tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and urease activity (Tab. III). These culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and VL agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (ZAG, ZAL, VLG, VLL), agar for isolation of faecal streptococci (SA) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (KA4, KA2). The strains Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Staphylococcus aureus Oxford 209 P were used as indicator bacteria. Tables I and II show the results of these tests. The tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on SA medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. On ZAG medium, the zones of enterococci with the AO 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. All strains with the 209P indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. The larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the ZAL medium with the AO24/85 strain. The production of tested strains was balanced on VLG agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [A comparative microbiological and pharmacokinetic activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin].
AB  - Vancomycin and teicoplanin are two commercially available glycopeptide antibiotics. They have identical spectra of activity and similar mechanisms of action, and both are complex molecules. In vitro, vancomycin is more active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, while teicoplanin is more active against enterococci and pneumococci. The activity of the two antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus is similar. The serum pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and teicoplanin are highly different, teicoplanin having a longer elimination half-life (40 hours versus 6-8 hours for vancomycin), but a higher degree of protein binding (90% versus 55%). We compared the two antibiotics on the basis of their inhibitory quotient kinetics, using the MIC90 values for the above bacterial species as the microbiological parameters, and the total and free (non-protein bound) serum concentrations as the pharmacokinetic parameters. The inhibitory quotient kinetics of vancomycin were always more favorable in terms of the free concentrations, even against those bacteria for which the teicoplanin MIC was lower.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. Spanish Collaborative Group.
AB  - The activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. Clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups C, G and F, Brucella melitensis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against Ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against Campylobacter spp. In general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. Cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. Clarithromycin was bactericidal against Streptococcus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Evaluation of the E test by using selected gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The E test (AB Biodisk NA Inc.) was compared with standard reference methods using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards's recommendations for determining the MICs of four selected antibiotics against 208 clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. These bacteria included 32 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 25 strains of Enterococcus faecium, 20 strains of oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (OSSA), 96 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA), and 35 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Evaluation included MIC accuracy within 1 dilution, reproducibility testing, and cost analysis. There was 94% agreement between the E test and the reference method in testing S. pneumoniae and penicillin G. There was 92% agreement with ampicillin and 100% agreement with vancomycin in testing E. faecium isolates. Accuracy of the oxacillin E test with staphylococci was significantly improved by the use of salt-supplemented Mueller-Hinton agar, for an agreement of 100% with coagulase-negative staphylococci and oxacillin-sensitive S. aureus and that of 85% with oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, with no major discrepancies. The E test with American Type Culture Collection isolates and clinical strains gave excellent reproducibility and was less costly than microdilution panels when used to test fewer than three antibiotics. The E test is a simple, reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective method for MIC determination for gram-positive organisms.
TI  - The activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, JM-1397 (OsO2[xylyl]2) and JM-2469 (AuCl[S2CPEt3]). Both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of 1 microgram/ml for JM-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for JM-2469. Similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus). JM-2469 inhibited group A, B, C, F, and G beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) but Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml. JM-1397 had MICs for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides, and Clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). MICs of both compounds for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. These studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against Gram-positive and anaerobic species.
TI  - In vitro activity of decaplanin (M86-1410), a new glycopeptide antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of decaplanin (formerly M86-1410), a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, was tested against 169 gram-positive bloodstream isolates from patients at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and 12 selected vancomycin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, bacilli, corynebacteria, and listeria were inhibited by decaplanin (MICs for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90s], 0.12 to 4 micrograms/ml). However, some rarely isolated and selected Enterococcus sp. populations had a MIC90 of 16 micrograms/ml, and S. haemolyticus strains had a MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. These in vitro results suggest that decaplanin may be useful against most gram-positive strains, even though some Enterococcus species and coagulase-negative staphylococci were potentially resistant (MICs, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Small and medium-angle X-ray analysis of bacterial lipoteichoic acid phase structure.
AB  - X-ray scattering analysis was performed on various types of bacterial lipoteichoic acid in solution. The X-ray data show that all samples investigated were characterized by a similar micellar ultrastructure (hydrophilic moiety on the outside) with a fatty acid chain conformation of the disordered, alpha-type at all temperatures between 5 degrees-53 degrees C. The size distribution of Staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid micelles was sufficiently homogeneous to determine their size and some related molecular parameters by detailed small-angle X-ray scattering analysis. Nearly independent of the degree of D-alanine substitution and the ionic strength of the aqueous dispersion, an average micelle contained about 150 lipoteichoic acid molecules arranged in a spherical assembly with a diameter of about 22 nm, whereby the hydrophilic region occupied an outer shell of about 8.5 nm thickness. Based on the average chain length of lipoteichoic acid, it could be estimated that each glycerophosphate residue contributed by about 0.34 nm to the thickness of the hydrophilic shell as compared to a theoretical value of approximately 0.8 nm for a fully extended chain conformation, indicating a highly coiled conformation of the hydrophilic chain. The bearing of these findings on the properties of membrane-associated and secreted lipoteichoic acids is discussed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new glycopeptide SK&F 104662 against problematic gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new glycopeptide antibiotic SK&F 104662 against problematic gram-positive microorganisms was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, ampicillin, oxacillin, vancomycin, erythromycin and gentamicin were tested. SK&F 104662 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin sensitive and resistant strains), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium jeikeium and Corynebacterium group D2. All of 254 isolates, except one vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecium, were inhibited by 2 mg/l of SK&F 104662; this compound may thus be potentially useful in the treatment of infections with the above-mentioned gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - [Clinical features of enterococcal septicemia and antimicrobial susceptibilities  for clinical isolates of enterococci in Nagoya University Hospital].
AB  - Enterococci are important causative organisms of nosocomial infections as well as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterococcal bacteremia has been increased in Nagoya University Hospital from April 1983 to March 1990. We analyzed the clinical backgrounds, portal of entry and mortality for the patients with Enterococcal septicemia. Thirty-four cases with enterococcal septicemia (24 Enterococcus faecalis, 10 Enterococcus faecium) were subjected in this study. Twenty-seven cases were monomicrobial septicemia and 7 cases were polymicrobial septicemia. As to the portal of entry, intra-abdominal infections in 21 cases, urinary tract infections in 4 cases, respiratory tract infections or chest tubes in 2 cases, decbitus infection in 1 case, intravascular catheter in 1 case, and unknown sources in 5 cases. Total mortality of the septicemia was 44.1%. E. faecium and Enterococcus avium were much more resistant to antimicrobial agents than E. faecalis. Enterococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than 2000 micrograms/ml) accounted for 35% of the 26 clinical isolates of enterococci.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef and cefazolin in combination with vancomycin.
AB  - 207 clinical isolates from strains of patients from the University Children's Hospital of Kiel were investigated for their in vitro activity with the agar dilution method against flomoxef and cefazolin (alone and partially in combination with vancomycin). Staphylococci were also tested with other cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, cefotetan and latamoxef). Flomoxef and cefazolin always acted more vigorously on staphylococci than the other cephalosporins. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus strains against flomoxef and cefazolin did not occur but was found in 15 and 5 of 98 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, respectively. Enterococcus faecalis strains were always resistant against both drugs; Streptococcus faecium strains were only moderately sensitive. Combined testing of flomoxef or cefazolin with vancomycin showed synergism in almost all staphylococcal strains. Synergism was stronger when S. epidermidis strains were only weakly sensitive to or resistant against flomoxef and cefazolin in comparison to highly sensitive strains. Flomoxef (or cefazolin) acted synergistically in combination with vancomycin on E. faecalis and S. faecium with the exception of two strains of E. faecalis which showed an additive effect of both drugs.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of phenethyl alcohol and resulting membrane alterations.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of phenethyl alcohol (PEA) towards Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium) was investigated. This activity was expressed as IC (inhibitory concentration) and BC (bactericidal concentration). PEA was bactericidal in the concentration range of 90 to 180 mM, these concentrations being 4- to 5-fold higher than the corresponding IC. The mechanism of action of PEA upon the cell membrane of bacteria was also studied. Morphological examination with a transmission electron microscope showed that Gram-negative cell envelopes were permeabilized; for Gram-positive bacteria, the plasmic membrane in S. aureus was solubilized, whereas lesser changes were observed in E. faecium. At lethal concentrations, PEA also induced a rapid and total leakage of K+ ions from the four strains studied. Despite the correlation between alterations in the structural integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane in Gram-negative cells and the loss of cell viability, it cannot be inferred that membrane damage is the only cause of the lethal effect.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the leaves of Phyllanthus discoideus.
AB  - The lyophilized aqueous extract (LWE) from the leaves of Phyllanthus discoideus was found to show an antibacterial activity. The alkaloid fraction obtained from LWE inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium (MIC = 1.6 mg/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC = 0.78 mg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC = 0.2 mg/ml). Among the alkaloids identified, viroallosecurinine and securinine showed a high activity. Viroallosecurinine exhibited a MIC of 0.48 micrograms/ml for Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus. This alkaloid is bactericidal since the yields of MIC/MBC were less than 1. The MIC of securinine was 0.500 mg/ml for E. coli, Staph. aureus and Myc. smegmatis. These effects of Phyllanthus discoideus leaf extracts support some of the local uses of the plant in traditional therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of PD127,391, a new quinolone against bacterial isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD127,391, a new 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates from patients with cancer. PD127,391 was found to have a broad antimicrobial spectrum with excellent activity against gram-positive isolates (including multidrug-resistant organism such as Corynebacterium jeikeium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp.). It was also extremely active against gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against organisms such as Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Acinetobacter spp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia, which are frequently resistant to a variety of antimicrobial agents, PD127,391 exhibited good activity, inhibiting all such isolates at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml. Overall, PD127,391 was far more potent than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive isolates and slightly more active against gram-negative isolates. No bacterium that we examined needed more than 2 micrograms/ml of PD127,391 for inhibition.
TI  - The bactericidal effect of isoascorbic acid combined with mild heat.
AB  - The thermal inactivation of Salmonella thompson, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Candida zeylanoides, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis was accelerated by the addition of sodium isoascorbate (1 mmol/l) to phosphate-buffer heating medium but not to complex food mixtures. The lethal effect of isoascorbate was nullified by heating under anaerobic conditions or by the addition of catalase. The scavengers of hydroxyl radicals, mannitol and formate were not protective whereas histidine was. Histidine may have protected by slowing the rate of isoascorbate autoxidation, a property common to other amino acids tested. Superoxide dismutase was not protective. Dehydroascorbic acid also enhanced heat killing and its action was also reversed by catalase. The bactericidal effects of mild heat plus isoascorbate or dehydroascorbic acid both apparently depend on oxidative processes but their relative effectiveness was not related to their respective rates of oxygen consumption or peroxide production. We speculate that site-specific redox reactions, involving amino-carbonyl intermediates are involved in the inactivation mechanism.
TI  - Activity of meropenem, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A new carbapenem antibiotic, meropenem, was shown to be active against a large number of Gram-positive bacteria. The drug inhibited penicillinase-positive and -negative, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci equally well. Among the comparative antimicrobials examined, only N-formimidoyl-thienamycin (imipenem) was two to four times more active than meropenem. Compared with vancomycin or methicillin, meropenem was 10-20 times more active. Strains of 11 species of streptococci were highly susceptible to meropenem; the geometric mean MICs of the drug for these species ranged from 0.01 to 0.04 mg/l. The agent, however, only had moderate activity against Enterococcus faecalis (mean MIC 5 mg/l) and Ent. faecium (mean MIC 11.6 mg/l). Among Corynebacterium jeikeium, strains were encountered that showed susceptibility to meropenem but resistance to imipenem and other beta-lactams. Strains of other corynebacteria, Rhodococcus equi, Erysopelothrix rhusiopathiae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus spp. all were highly susceptible to meropenem (mean MICs 0.04-0.17 mg/l). Although methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by concentrations of 1-2 mg/l of meropenem in agar dilution tests, such strains showed heteroresistance in population studies, as is typical for all beta-lactam antibiotics. In addition, the biochemical correlate of methicillin-resistance, penicillin-binding protein 2', showed low affinity for meropenem, similar to that for imipenem. Meropenem was as bactericidal as imipenem and comparative bactericidal antimicrobials in killing-curve experiments. Strains of Ent. faecium, C. jeikeium, and L. monocytogenes were killed at a slower rate than streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - Resistance studies with ofloxacin.
AB  
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [The effect of roxithromycin on the aerobic fecal flora in children].
AB  - To evaluate the effect of roxithromycin on aerobic flora in 14 children treated orally (5 mg/kg/day during 5 to 7 days) quantitative stool cultures were performed using selective media. Enterobacteriaceae (EB), streptococci D (STR D), Staphylococcus aureus, Candida were counted at days 0, 2 and 5 days, and 2 days after treatment. The MIC of each strain was determined for roxithromycin, erythromycin and spiramycin. Ten infants in a nursery had already received antibiotics. A moderate albeit significant (p less than 0.01) decrease was observed for EB, falling from 7.2 log 10 (range 5-9) to 4.9 (range 2-8) per gram of stools, rising to 5.8 after treatment. There was no significant effect for STR D. The MIC of roxithromycin for EB increased from 244 mg/l (range 0.03-512) to 340 (range 0.03-512). For STR. D, it increased from 138 (range 1-1024) to 427 (range 1-1024). The bacteria with low MIC (less than or equal to 64 mg/l for EB and less than or equal to 4 mg/l for STR. D) are Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecium. The MIC increased for the three macrolides tested.
TI  - The enterococci: evidence of species-specific clinical and microbiologic heterogeneity.
AB  - Investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. To characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the Dallas Veterans Administration Medical Center (DVAMC) in 1986 were reviewed. During this period, 220 Enterococcus faecalis, 21 Enterococcus faecium, 12 Enterococcus avium, and no Enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the DVAMC microbiology laboratory. Clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. Nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence of the three enterococcal species. Enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. Although Enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. E. avium was more resistant than E. faecalis or E. faecium to penicillin G and ampicillin and less resistant to most other antimicrobial agents. The results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.
TI  - Transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium BM4165 and BM4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (LY146032). Strain BM4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics. The genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to MLS antibiotics in strain BM4165 were carried on plasmids pIP819 and pIP821, respectively; pIP819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to MLS antibiotics. The two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other E. faecium strains. Plasmid pIP819 could also conjugate to E. faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, S. pyogenes, S. lactis, and Listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to S. aureus. Glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. Based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.
TI  - [Role of Enterococcus faecium SF 68 in experimental infection in mice].
AB  - The normal intestinal flora is an important defence against various infectious agents. It also allows important metabolic stages in the host. The Authors studied the ability of Enterococcus faecium SF 68 to protect the mice (Swiss strain) from infection by Salmonella typhi and its role when used with penicillin in infection by Staphylococcus aureus. Our results showed that SF 68, determined a good protection against infection. Moreover the association E. faecium SF 68-antibiotic lowers the mortality rate in the infected mice compared with the control group.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  - We have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. In-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. Although pristinamycin's mean MIC for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against Streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. Enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 Enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin showed poor activity against Haemophilus influenzae (mode MIC 1.56 and MIC90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 Neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin inhibited all nine Clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. It was less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group: (MIC90 3.12 mg/l). Pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
TI  - In vitro selection of bacteria resistant to LY146032, a new cyclic lipopeptide.
AB  - Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci were investigated for their abilities, in vitro, to develop resistance to LY146032. Exposure of the organisms to incremental concentrations of LY146032 resulted in MICs 8- to 32-fold higher than those for the original isolates. After three passages on antibiotic-free medium, the high MICs were maintained for the coagulase-negative staphylococci and pneumococci, with a twofold decrease observed for the enterococci and a fourfold decrease observed for Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of spontaneous emergence of resistance was highest with S. pneumoniae (1.2 X 10(-6) at 16 times the original MIC) and lowest with S. aureus (7.0 X 10(-10) at 8 times the original MIC). For bacteria For bacteria surviving time-kill studies MICs were also higher than were those for the original isolates. Exposure to LY146032 in vitro selected for strains with decreased susceptibilities to the antimicrobial agent. However, the emergence of resistance in vivo is unpredictable and can be evaluated only after prolonged clinical use of the drug.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY146032 was compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci. MICs of LY146032 were lowest for Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.25 mg/l). For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus the MICs were 1 mg/l, for Enterococcus faecalis 2 mg/l and for Enterococcus faecium 4 mg/l. The activity of LY146032 was in general higher than that of vancomycin. Time-kill studies showed LY146032 had higher bactericidal activity than vancomycin against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain, and bactericidal activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic LY146032 was generally four-fold greater (MIC 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. Enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, group B and viridans streptococci, and Corynebacterium group J-K isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of LY146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. Unlike vancomycin, LY146032 was bactericidal for Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes. Due to its bactericidal properties LY146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  - Plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups A, B, and G, ten from enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pIP501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group B Streptococcus. The 6.3-kb HindIII fragment of pIP501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pBR322. A 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. The absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group B Streptococcus, as well as three isolated from E. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants in the streptococci and in the enterococci.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cAM373) also produced by Staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (Tn918).
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis RC73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pAM373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cAM373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. The pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 Staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22 coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. Streptococcus sanguis Challis and G9B also produced the activity, but 10 other Streptococcus sanguis strains did not. The activity was also produced by Streptococcus faecium 9790. A tetracycline resistance (Tc) determinant present in S. faecalis RC73 was not associated with pAM373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pAM373 among other plasmids present in the strain. Analyses of the Tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to Tn916. Designated Tn918, the transposon could insert into pAM373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. Whereas pAM373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of Streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus sanguis. However, a derivative of pAM373 carrying Tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.
TI  - Effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth (BBL). Some of the effectors, e.g., Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, Lactobacillus lactis, L. brevis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of S. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most cultures were inhibitory, and some (S. faecium and L. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the Staphylococcus. Low-temperature meat lactobacilli and Leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited S. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 C throughout its growth. Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 C, as well. When the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat Lactobacillus, and L. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 C, and all but the meat Lactobacillus did so at 22 C. A ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 C, except that S. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by S. faecalis. A ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. In general, the more effector bacteria there were in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of S. aureus. Inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 C, less so at 20 or 25 C, and least at 30 or 37 C, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. Results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of S. aureus were similar, for the most part.
