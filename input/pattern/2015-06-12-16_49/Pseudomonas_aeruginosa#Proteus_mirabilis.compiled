TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of Portuguese Foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the centre and south of Portugal. Composition of essential oils was established by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. A total of 16 compounds were identified. The main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). The percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. Antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: Aspergillus niger, A. japonicus, A. oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizophus oryzae and R. stolonifer. Antibacterial activity was assessed against three Gram-positive strains: Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and S. aureus ATCC 28213; and against six Gram-negative strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; Morganella morganii LFG 08; Proteus mirabilis LFG 04; Salmonella enteritidis LFG 05; S. entiritidis serovar typhimurium LFG 06 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. The MIC values varied from 62.5 (E. coli ATCC 25922) to 2000 micromL (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853).
TI  - Gram-negative bacteraemia in haemodialysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on renal replacement therapy experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality, infection being the second commonest cause of death. In our haemodialysis population, we identify the pathogens, sensitivity patterns, sources of infection and outcomes of Gram-negative bacteraemia. METHODS: Data from the NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde and NHS Forth Valley haemodialysis population were collected July 2011 to April 2014 through an interrogation of the renal unit electronic patient record, and confirmed by an independent search of the Microbiology database. RESULTS: Over 544 377 haemodialysis days, 84 patients experienced 95 Gram-negative bacteraemia events, a rate of 0.175 events per 1000 haemodialysis days, which varied with dialysis modality: non-tunnelled central venous catheters 4.77, arteriovenous grafts 0.24, tunnelled central venous catheters 0.21, and arteriovenous fistulae 0.11 per 1000 haemodialysis days. The commonest sources of bacteraemia were central venous catheters (CVCs) (16.8%, n = 16), infected ulcers (14.7%, n = 14), urinary (10.5%, n = 10), biliary (9.5%, n = 9) and intra-abdominal (9.5%, n = 9). The principal organisms were Escherichia coli (49.5%, n = 47), Enterobacter spp. (13.1%, n = 13), Klebsiella spp. (11.1%, n = 11), Proteus mirabilis (6.1%, n = 6) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%, n = 5). Of the Enterobacteriaceae (n = 84), 88% were sensitive to gentamicin, 81% to ciprofloxacin, 91% to piperacillin-tazobactam and 100% were sensitive to meropenem. Three-month case mortality was 25.3% (n = 24). Ten patients (11.9%) had more than one Gram-negative bacteraemia; of these, nine patients (90.0%) were the same causative organism, predominantly E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: CVCs and diabetic foot ulcers remain significant risk factors for Gram-negative bacteraemia, highlighting the importance of vascular access planning. Despite good levels of antibiotic sensitivity, the early mortality following Gram-negative bacteraemia remains high, supporting aggressive treatment of such pathogens.
TI  - Comparative Study in Early Neonates with Septicemia by Blood Culture, Staining Techniques and C - Reactive Protein (CRP).
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to compare and evaluate the pathogenic bacteria in neo-natal septicemia by using various diagnostic techniques. SETTING AND DESIGN: Our study was designed to evaluate a feasible method to diagnose neonatal septicemia even at primary health centre level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected aseptically from 70 neonates. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth and subcultures were performed with specific media. Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of isolates was studied by Modified Kirby Bauer Disc diffusion technique and differentiate the isolates by staining methods. C-reactive protein (CRP) was evaluated by using standard kit method. RESULTS: Out of 70 cases of childhood septicemia of age group 1-30 days, 37 had positive CRP, 36 were positive for BCS and blood culture was positive only in 41 cases, where predominant organism being Klebsiella species (n=28, 68.29%) followed by Escherichia coli (n=4, 9.76%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=3,7.31%), Proteus mirabilis (n=2,4.88%) and Coagulase negative staphylococcus (n=4,9.76%). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Klebsiella species as an important cause of neonatal septicemia. The isolated organisms were found to be highly sensitive to cefatoxime and amikacin. Hence, these antibiotics can be considered as the first drug of choice for neonatal septicemia.
TI  - Susceptibility trends and molecular characterization of Gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections in Jordan and Lebanon: SMART 2011-2013.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate phenotypic and genotypic patterns of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) and intra-abdominal infection (IAI) in medical centres of Jordan and Lebanon. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli from the SMART study, collected between the years 2011 and 2013, were first identified at local laboratories. These isolates were shipped to a central laboratory where re-identification, susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization were performed using standard methods. RESULTS: Among the 523 UTI-associated isolates, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis were the most frequent (70%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent species among the 527 IAI-associated isolates (46%, 14%, and 12%, respectively). Incidence rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers among UTI-associated E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis were 43%, 54%, and 4%, respectively. Corresponding rates among IAI-associated isolates were 49%, 56%, and 12%, respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates showed very disturbing low susceptibility patterns. CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent ESBL produced. Seventeen isolates were non-susceptible to carbapenems (estimated prevalence of 1.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The alarmingly high rates of ESBL production and emergence of carbapenemases emphasize the urgent need to develop antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and to maintain antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems.
TI  - Observations on the current bacteriological profile of chronic suppurative otitis media in South eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a disease well-known for its recurrence and persistence despite treatment. The situation is compounded by the increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents by bacteria these days. AIM: This study was carried out to examine the current local bacteriological profile of CSOM and to compare the profile of either ear in bilaterally discharging ears. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a retrospective analysis of ear swab cultures from 133 unilateral and 73 bilateral consecutive tubotympanic CSOM cases seen at the Ear-Nose-Throat clinics of a referral health institution during a 4 year period ending 2013. Sensitivities to eight locally available antibiotics were analyzed. Aerobic bacterial isolates were analyzed separately for the unilateral and bilateral cases. Comparison was made between the ears in the bilateral cases. RESULTS: We analyzed 279 ear swab culture results from 206 patients with age ranging from 5 months to 86 years and a mean of 21.3 (19.5) years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common isolated bacteria (44% [109/250]) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (17% [42/250]), and Proteus Mirabilis (15% [38/250]). The most and least sensitive bacteria were Klebsiella Spp and Escherichia Coli, respectively. The most effective antibiotics were gentamicin and ciprofloxacin. The two ears differ significantly in the rates of isolation of S. aureus and E. coli (P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas is the most common bacteria involved in CSOM in this part of the country. Ciprofloxacin as ear drops is recommended as first-line drug in the management of active CSOM as it is cheap, less ototoxic, and locally available. Separate ear swab culture should be obtained in bilateral CSOM.
TI  - Colonization, competition, and dispersal of pathogens in fluid flow networks.
AB  - The colonization of bacteria in complex fluid flow networks, such as those found  in host vasculature, remains poorly understood. Recently, it was reported that many bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis [1], Escherichia coli [2], and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3, 4], can move in the opposite direction of fluid flow. Upstream movement results from the interplay between fluid shear stress and bacterial motility structures, and such rheotactic-like behavior is predicted to occur for a wide range of conditions [1]. Given the potential ubiquity of upstream movement, its impact on population-level behaviors within hosts could be significant. Here, we find that P. aeruginosa communities use a diverse set of motility strategies, including a novel surface-motility mechanism characterized by counter-advection and transverse diffusion, to rapidly disperse throughout vasculature-like flow networks. These motility modalities give P. aeruginosa a selective growth advantage, enabling it to self-segregate from other human pathogens such as Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus that outcompete P. aeruginosa in well-mixed non-flow environments. We develop a quantitative model of bacterial colonization in flow networks, confirm our model in vivo in plant vasculature, and validate a key prediction that colonization and dispersal can be inhibited by modifying surface chemistry. Our results show that the interaction between flow mechanics and motility structures shapes the formation of mixed-species communities and suggest a general mechanism by which bacteria could colonize hosts. Furthermore, our results suggest novel strategies for tuning the composition of multi-species bacterial communities in hosts, preventing inappropriate colonization in medical devices, and combatting bacterial infections.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activities of minocycline and rifampin-impregnated silicone surfaces in an in vitro urinary system model.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity in urinary catheters and silicones in antibiotic-coated prosthetic urinary systems in order to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by catheter-associated infection. METHODS: The study was initiated in 1993 at Houston, USA and continued in Turkey till 1996. A sterileplastic bag was used as kidney in the in vitro urinary system. Physiological renal jet streams (50 cc/h) were generated with an intravenous metric pump. The temperature was kept at body temperature. The bladder drainage was achieved at the physiological drainage period of 4-6 hours during the 72-hour experiment. Silicone surfaces coated with pure silicone and impregnated with Minocycline-Rifampin were exposed to the urine contaminated with the targeted bacteria in the in vitro urinary model for 72 hours. Antimicrobial activities occurring in the Eosin methylene blue and blood agar media in the infected silicones were assessed. RESULTS: Minocycline-Rifampin silicone surfaces exposed to the urine contaminated with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa reported reproduction. No reproduction was observed in the culture of Minocycline- Rifampin-impregnated silicone surfaces for Proteus mirabilis.The difference with the control group was regarded as statistically significant for Proteus mirabilis (p < 0.005). Minocycline-Rifampin-coated silicones were closely monitored only for Proteus mirabilis in the in vitro urinary medium. Although inhibition zones (< 10 mm) in the cultures were observed for Minocycline-Rifampin-coated silicones for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the microbial efficacy was not regarded sufficient. CONCLUSION: There is still need for evidence-based in vivo and in vitro studies where antimicrobial activity is evaluated on the surface of catheters.
TI  - Polyphenolic extract from maple syrup potentiates antibiotic susceptibility and reduces biofilm formation of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Phenolic compounds are believed to be promising candidates as complementary therapeutics. Maple syrup, prepared by concentrating the sap from the North American maple tree, is a rich source of natural and process-derived phenolic compounds. In this work, we report the antimicrobial activity of a phenolic-rich maple syrup extract (PRMSE). PRMSE exhibited antimicrobial activity as well as strong synergistic interaction with selected antibiotics against Gram-negative clinical strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among the phenolic constituents of PRMSE, catechol exhibited strong synergy with antibiotics as well as with other phenolic components of PRMSE against bacterial growth. At sublethal concentrations, PRMSE and catechol efficiently reduced biofilm formation and increased the susceptibility of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism for the observed synergy with antibiotics, PRMSE was found to increase outer membrane permeability of all bacterial strains and effectively inhibit efflux pump activity. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that PRMSE significantly repressed multiple-drug resistance genes as well as genes associated with motility, adhesion, biofilm formation, and virulence. Overall, this study provides a proof of concept and starting point for investigating the molecular mechanism of the reported increase in bacterial antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of PRMSE.
TI  - Spectrum of bacterial pathogens and their antibiogram from cases of urinary tract infection among renal disorder patients.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the commonest bacterial infection occurring in renal disorder patients and is associated with significant morbidity. Resistance to antibiotics is highly prevalent in bacterial isolates and is an emerging problem in UTI. A hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from April 2011 to September 2011 to determine the frequency and bacterial profile of urinary tract infections in the patients with renal disorders visiting KIST Hospital along with their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Urine samples were collected from 300 clinically-suspected cases of UTI among renal disorder patients and investigated by conventional semi-quantitative culture technique, microscopy and antibiotic susceptibility test. Significant bacteriuria were detected in 34% of the total subjects, mostly from patients with Chronic Kidney Disease. Incidence of bacteriuria was found higher in females (40.40%) than in males (27.52%) and mostly occurred in elderly patients. Escherichia coli (62.75%) was the predominant isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.78%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.80%), Coagulase negative Staphylococcus aureus (CoNS) (5.88%), Enterococcus spp (3.92%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.00%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.00%), Proteus mirabilis (2.00%) and Proteus vulgaris (1.00%). Multidrug resistance was observed in 68.82% of the total bacterial isolates.
TI  - Bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in China: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of Chinese county hospitals. A total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli (42.3% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7%), and Proteus mirabilis (39.0%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of E. coli strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly, with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.
TI  - Propagation capacity of bacterial contaminants in platelet concentrates using a luciferase reporter system.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Currently the use of molecular tools and techniques of Genetic Engineering in the study of microbial behavior in blood components has replaced the employment of classical methods of microbiology. This work focuses on the use of a novel lux reporter system for monitoring the contaminating propagation capacity of bacteria present in platelet concentrates under standard storage conditions in the blood bank. METHODS: A miniTn5 promotor probe carrying the lux operon from Photorhabdus luminiscens (pUTminiTn5luxCDABEKm2) was used to construct four bacterial bioluminescent mutants: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Luminescent mutants were used for contamination tests with 20 CFU in platelet concentrates bags and were stored under standard storage conditions in the blood bank (100 rpm at 22 degrees C). The measurements of luminous activity and optical density were used to monitor bacterial proliferation during 7 days (168 h). RESULTS: During the exponential growth phase (log) of bacterial strains, a lineal correlation between luminous activity vs biomass was observed (R(2) = 0.985, 0.976, 0.981) for E. coli::Tn5luxCDABEKm2, P. mirabilis::Tn5luxCDABEKm2 and P. auriginosa::Tn5luxCDABEKm2, respectively. The above indicates that metabolic activity (production of ATP) is directly related to biomass in this phase of microbial growth. While conducting experiments, the inability to propagate S. typhi::Tn5luxCDABEKm2 was detected. We can speculate that platelet concentrates contain specific components that prevent the propagation of S. typhi. CONCLUSION: The use of luxCDABE system for the quantification of luminous activity is a rapid and sensitive alternative to study the propagation and auto-sterilization of bacterial contaminants in platelet concentrates.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Antifungal Activity of Pelargonium roseum Essential Oils.
AB  - PURPOSE: The antiseptic qualities of aromatic and medicinal plants and their extracts have been recognized since antiquity, while attempts to characterize these properties in the laboratory date back the beginning of the XX(th) century. In the current study essential oils obtained from Pelargonium roseum (Geraniacea) were analyzed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of the Pelargonium essential oil was tested against Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (Candida albicans). Disc diffusion method was used to study antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Inhibition zones showed that the studied essential oils were active against all of the studied bacteria. In the case of Candida albicans, the complete inhibition of the fungus's development was observed. In the cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus we observed an inhibition comparable to that obtained by the use of an appropriate antimicrobial substance. CONCLUSION: The volatile oils exhibited considerable inhibitory effects against all the organisms under test, in some cases comparable with those of the reference antibiotics. There were no considerable differences between the antimicrobial activities of the oil obtained by distillation and commercially available Pelargonium oils.
TI  - Rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: Results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan are lacking. METHODS: We surveyed the MIC distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan in 2007. We also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2014 were applied. RESULTS: Colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. cloacae. The ceftobiprole MIC90 value was 4 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa. The phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the MIC value of ceftobiprole among S. aureus isolates. Interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among P. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three Enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of ICU pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the ICU.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts and isoquinoline alkaloids of selected papaveraceae plants.
AB  - Alkaloidal extracts of seven selected plants of the family Papaveraceae were studied with respect to their activity against six strains of pathogenic bacteria and their alkaloidal fingerprint. Twenty-four alkaloids were determined by GC/MS, and twenty of them identified from their mass spectra, retention times and retention indexes. In the antibacterial assay, three Gram-positive (Enterorococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and S. hyicus), and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains were used. The most promising antimicrobial activity was shown by the alkaloidal extract of Macleaya cordata with MIC values of 16 mug/mL for Staphylococcus aureus, 32 mug/mL for Enterococcus faecalis and 64 mug/mL for Staphylococcus hyicus and Escherichia coli. All the tested pure isoquinoline alkaloids were considered inactive within the tested concentrations.
TI  - Prevalence and Antibiotic Resistance of Gram-Negative Pathogenic Bacteria Species Isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches are among the medically important pests found within the  human habitations that cause serious public health problems. They may harbor a number of pathogenic bacteria on the external surface with antibiotic resistance. Hence, they are regarded as major microbial vectors. This study investigates the prevalence and antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria species isolated from Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica in Varanasi, India. METHODS: Totally, 203 adult cockroaches were collected form 44 households and 52 food-handling establishments by trapping. Bacteriological examination of external surfaces of Pe. americana and Bl. germanica were carried out using standard method and antibiotics susceptibility profiles of the isolates were determined using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion methods. RESULTS: Among the places, we found that 54% had cockroache infestation in households and 77% in food- handling establishments. There was no significant different between the overall bacteria load of the external surface in Pe. americana (64.04%) and Bl. germanica (35.96%). However the predominant bacteria on cockroaches were Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, Kl. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa were the most prevalent, drug-resistant strains were isolated from the cockroaches with 100% resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ampicillin. For individual strains of bacteria, Escherichia coli was found to have multi-resistance to four antibiotic tested, Citrobacter freundii four, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis to three. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches are uniformly distributed in domestic environment, which can be a possible vector for transmission of drug-resistant bacteria and food-borne diseases.
TI  - Identification and phenotypic characterization of the most frequent bacterial etiologies in chronic skin ulcers.
AB  - Chronic wounds represent an important burden on the healthcare system, requiring  frequent hospitalizations and expensive treatments. It is now recognized that a primary factor contributing to a non-healing trajectory and a low therapeutic response is the biofilm infection. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacterial isolates collected from chronic skin wounds of hospitalized patients and to evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, virulence factors, as well as the ability to develop biofilms in vitro. A number of 44 wound samples were collected from 39 patients. The isolated strains belonged to seven different microbial species, i.e.: Staphylococcus aureus (32 strains), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Proteus mirabilis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), group G beta-hemolytic streptococci (1). In comparison to the other isolates, P. aeruginosa strains exhibited the highest capacity to develop complex biofilm structures in vitro, followed by S. aureus, with insignificant differences between MRSA and non-methicillin resistant isolates. The Enterobacteriaceae strains expressed less virulent phenotypes, lower adherence to epithelial cells and biofilm forming capacity, but also significant resistance phenotypes with a potential of unfavorable epidemiological outcome. The isolation of MRSA, ESBL-producing microorganisms and multiple antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa suggests the potential risk of nosocomial spread and the potential severe outcome in case of bacteremia and sepsis. This study represents an important step in elucidating the host-wound microbiome interaction, by describing various resistance and virulence threats of microorganisms colonizing and/or infecting the chronic wounds. However, in order to establish a statistical relevant correlation, larger studies are needed.
TI  - [The urinary bacterial flora in patients with cutaneous ureterostomy].
AB  - Twenty-four patients with cutaneous ureterostomy at least 6 months after surgery  were included in this study. Single-J ureteral catheters were indwelt in 7 patients. Pouch urine was cultured and analyzed from asymptomatic patients and from those with pyelonephritis. Forty-eight bacterial strains were isolated from asymptomatic patients. Thirty-five of these strains consisting of 18 species were isolated from the patients without ureteral catheters. Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (20.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Proteus (P.) mirabilis (11. 4%) were isolated at high frequency. One methicilline-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) strain was isolated. Thirteen bacterial strains consisting of 8 species were isolated from the patients with ureteral catheters. E. faecalis (23.1%), Eschericia (E.) coli (23.1%) and Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa (15.4%) were isolated at high frequency. One E. coli strain harboring extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) and one MRCNS strain were isolated. Pyelonephritis occurred in 5 patients 14 times during follow-up for at least 6 months after surgery. The patients with ureteral catheters suffered from pyelonephritis (4/7, 57.1%) more frequently as compared to the patients without catheters (1/17, 5.9%) (p = 0.014). P. aeruginosa (26.9%), E. faecium (15.4%), and P. mirabilis (11.5%) were isolated inhigh frequency. One E. coli strain harboring ESBL and one P. mirabilis strain harboring ESBL were isolated. In conclusion, insertion of ureteral catheters in a cutaneous ureterostomy is a strong risk factor for pyelonephritis and development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, urine culture is important in these patients who are under surveillance.
TI  - Bacterial uropathogens isolates and antibiograms in children under 5 years of age.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood urinary infections are among the most common febrile illnesses occurring during this period with varying susceptibility to antibiotic. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify uropathogens responsible to for urinarytract infection (UTIs) in children less than 5 years of age, and determine the antibiograms of the isolates to commonly used antibiotics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hundred and four children (2 months - 5 years old) seen at the Gadarif Teaching Hospital from January 2012 and December 2013 were evaluated. A urine specimen was obtained by a plastic bag with an adhesive backing around an opening or by direct voiding into sterile container. Urine was examined microscopically and those with significant pyuria and bacteruria were further cultured and microorganisms were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Out of 304 children suffering from UTIs; 145(47.7%) had significant pyuria of them; 54(17.8 %) had positive bacterial growth. The frequency of sex and residency were almost the same. E. coli (42.6%) was the most common uropathogen, sensitive to ciprofloxacin (91.3%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29.6%) sensitive to Ciprofloxacin (75%)and Norofloxacin (68.8%), Klebsiellapneumoniae (18.5%) sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Norofloxacin and Nalidixic acid (90%) and Proteus mirabilis sensitive to Ciprofloxacin and Norofloxacin (90%), Amoxicillin / clavulanic acid (Augmentin(80%). CONCLUSION: The most common uropathogens were E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Klebsiellapneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Ciprofloxacin is the recommended initial empirical therapy while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results.
TI  - Preparation and characterization of new biologically active polyurethane foams.
AB  - Biologically active polyurethane foams are the fast-developed alternative to many applications of biomedical materials. Due to the polyurethane structure features and foam technology it is possible to incorporate into their structure the biologically active compounds of target purpose via structural-chemical modification of macromolecule. A series of new biologically active polyurethane foams (PUFs) was synthesized with polyethers (MM 2500-5000), polyesters MM (500-2200), 2,4(2,6) toluene diisocyanate, water as a foaming agent, catalysts, foam stabilizers and functional compounds. Different functional compounds: 1,4-di-N-oxy-2,3-bis-(oxymethyl)-quinoxaline (DOMQ), partial sodium salt of poly(acrylic acid) and 2,6-dimethyl-N,N-diethyl aminoacetatanilide hydrochloride were incorporated into the polymer structure/composition due to the chemical and/or physical bonding. Structural peculiarities of PUFs were studied by FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray scattering. Self-adhesion properties of PUFs were estimated by measuring of tensile strength at break of adhesive junction. The optical microscopy method was performed for the PUF morphology studies. Toxicological estimation of the PUFs was carried out in vitro and in vivo. The antibacterial action towards the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATC 25922, E. coli ATC 2150, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6447, Staphylococcus aureus 180, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8180, Proteus mirabilis F 403, P. mirabilis 6054, and Proteus vulgaris 8718) was studied by the disc method on the solid nutrient. Physic-chemical properties of the PUFs (density, tensile strength and elongation at break, water absorption and vapor permeability) showed that all studied PUFs are within the operational requirements for such materials and represent fine-cellular foams. Spectral studies confirmed the incorporation of DOMQ into the PUF's macrochain. PUFs are characterized by microheterogeneous structure. They are antibacterially active, non-toxic materials with high affinity to the tissue body, self-adhesive properties and local anesthetic effect.
TI  - Bacteriophage-mediated control of a two-species biofilm formed by microorganisms  causing catheter-associated urinary tract infections in an in vitro urinary catheter model.
AB  - Microorganisms from a patient or their environment may colonize indwelling urinary catheters, forming biofilm communities on catheter surfaces and increasing patient morbidity and mortality. This study investigated the effect of pretreating hydrogel-coated silicone catheters with mixtures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis bacteriophages on the development of single- and two-species biofilms in a multiday continuous-flow in vitro model using artificial urine. Novel phages were purified from sewage, characterized, and screened for their abilities to reduce biofilm development by clinical isolates of their respective hosts. Our screening data showed that artificial urine medium (AUM) is a valid substitute for human urine for the purpose of evaluating uropathogen biofilm control by these bacteriophages. Defined phage cocktails targeting P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis were designed based on the biofilm inhibition screens. Hydrogel-coated catheters were pretreated with one or both cocktails and challenged with approximately 1x10(3) CFU/ml of the corresponding pathogen(s). The biofilm growth on the catheter surfaces in AUM was monitored over 72 to 96 h. Phage pretreatment reduced P. aeruginosa biofilm counts by 4 log10 CFU/cm2 (P</=0.01) and P. mirabilis biofilm counts by >2 log10 CFU/cm2 (P</=0.01) over 48 h. The presence of P. mirabilis was always associated with an increase in lumen pH from 7.5 to 9.5 and with eventual blockage of the reactor lines. The results of this study suggest that pretreatment of a hydrogel urinary catheter with a phage cocktail can significantly reduce mixed-species biofilm formation by clinically relevant bacteria.
TI  - Flow cytometry analysis using sysmex UF-1000i classifies uropathogens based on bacterial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts in urine specimens among patients with urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common bacterial infection. Urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosis, but new techniques, such as flow cytometry analysis (FCA), have been introduced. The aim of the present study was to evaluate FCA characteristics regarding bacteriuria, leukocyturia, and erythrocyturia in relation to cultured uropathogens in specimens from patients with a suspected UTI. We also wanted to evaluate whether the FCA characteristics can identify uropathogens prior to culture. From a prospective study, 1,587 consecutive urine specimens underwent FCA prior to culture during January and February 2012. Outpatients and inpatients (79.6% and 19.4%, respectively) were included, of whom women represented 67.5%. In total, 620 specimens yielded growth, of which Escherichia coli represented 65%, Enterococcus spp. 8%, Klebsiella spp. 7%, and Staphylococcus spp. 5%. For the uropathogens, the outcome of FCA was compared against the results for specimens with E. coli and those with a negative culture. E. coli had high bacterial (median, 17,914/mul), leukocyte (median, 348/mul), and erythrocyte (median, 23/mul) counts. With the exception of Klebsiella spp., the majority of the uropathogens had considerable or significantly lower bacterial counts than that of E. coli. High leukocyte counts were found in specimens with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group C streptococci. Elevated erythrocyte counts were found for P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, and group C streptococci, as well as for Staphylococcus saprophyticus. In essence, FCA adds new information about the bacterial, leukocyte, and erythrocyte counts in urine specimens for different uropathogens. Based on FCA characteristics, uropathogens can be classified and identified prior to culture. E. coli and Klebsiella spp. have similar FCA characteristics.
TI  - Restrictive reporting of selected antimicrobial susceptibilities influences clinical prescribing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cascade and restrictive reporting are useful strategies to enhance antibiotic stewardship programs. METHODS: We combined both strategies to improve the prescribing of antibiotics aimed at Gram-negative infections. RESULTS: For Enterobacter aerogenes, the susceptibility rates to amikacin increased from 10% to 100%; for third generation cephalosporins, these rates increased from 55% to 89%. The susceptibility rates of E. aerogenes to cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam changed little, and the ampicillin susceptibility decreased from 30% in 2009 to 11% in 2010. For Proteus mirabilis, the susceptibility rates increased for third-generation cephalosporins (48% vs. 92%) and piperacillin-tazobactam (10% vs. 98%), with minimal changes for cefepime (96% vs. 93%), ampicillin (69% vs. 73%) and amikacin (96% vs. 84%). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the susceptibility rates improved slightly for third-generation cephalosporins (81% vs. 91%) but reduced for piperacillin-tazobactam (99% vs. 59%). Hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile infections decreased from 0.11 to 0.07 per 1000 patient days. CONCLUSIONS: Selective reporting helps physicians choose the most appropriate antibiotics for their patients within a stewardship program, with reduced C. difficile infection.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological activity of new mixed ligand complexes of Zn(II) naproxen with nitrogen based ligands.
AB  - A series of novel Zn(II) complexes [Zn2(nap)4] (1), [Zn(nap)21,10-phen](2), [Zn(nap)22,9-dmphen] (3), [Zn(nap)2(2-ampy)2] (4), [Zn(nap)2(imid)2] (5), [Zn(nap)2(1,2-dmimid)2] (6) (nap = naproxen, 1,10-phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, 2,9-dmphen = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 2-ampy = 2-aminopyridine, imid = imidazole, 1,2-dmimid = 1,2-dimethyl imidazole) were synthesized and characterized using IR, UV-Vis, (1)H NMR, (13)C{(1)H} NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structure of complex 3 was determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In order to assess the effect of the metal ions on the anti-bacterial activity, complexes 1-6 have been screened in vitro, against (G(+)) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus) and (G(-)) bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli) using the agar well diffusion method. Complex 2 was the only complex that showed antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, where the complexation of the parent ligand 1,10-phenathroline enhanced significantly the activity. All the complexes showed different activity against the different bacteria, and were compared with activity of the parent ligands. The complexes were tested also for their anti-malarial activity using two methods: a semi-quantitative micro-assay and a previously self-developed quantitative in-vitro method. Both were used to study the efficiency of these complexes in inhibiting the formation of the Malaria pigment. This is considered an important target of many known anti-malarial drugs such as Chloroquine and Amodaquine. Results showed that the efficiency of complex 3 in preventing the formation of beta-hematin was 75%. The efficiency of Amodiaquine as a standard drug was reported to give 92.5.
TI  - Wild mushroom extracts as inhibitors of bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  - Microorganisms can colonize a wide variety of medical devices, putting patients in risk for local and systemic infectious complications, including local-site infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. These microorganisms are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilms. The use of natural products has been extremely successful in the discovery of new medicine, and mushrooms could be a source of natural antimicrobials. The present study reports the capacity of wild mushroom extracts to inhibit in vitro biofilm formation by multi-resistant bacteria. Four Gram-negative bacteria biofilm producers (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) isolated from urine were used to verify the activity of Russula delica, Fistulina hepatica, Mycena rosea, Leucopaxilus giganteus, and Lepista nuda extracts. The results obtained showed that all tested mushroom extracts presented some extent of inhibition of biofilm production. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the microorganism with the highest capacity of biofilm production, being also the most susceptible to the extracts inhibition capacity (equal or higher than 50%). Among the five tested extracts against E. coli, Leucopaxillus giganteus (47.8%) and Mycenas rosea (44.8%) presented the highest inhibition of biofilm formation. The extracts exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect upon P. mirabilis biofilm formation were Sarcodon imbricatus (45.4%) and Russula delica (53.1%). Acinetobacter baumannii was the microorganism with the lowest susceptibility to mushroom extracts inhibitory effect on biofilm production (highest inhibition-almost 29%, by Russula delica extract). This is a pioneer study since, as far as we know, there are no reports on the inhibition of biofilm production by the studied mushroom extracts and in particular against multi-resistant clinical isolates; nevertheless, other studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antibacterial and antioxidant activities of extracts of the bark of Melia azedarach (China Berry).
AB  - Nature provides a variety of drugs and medicinal agents derived from plants. This study was conducted to determine antimicrobial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of extracts of Melia azedarach bark with methanol/water (9:1 v/v), chloroform, butanol, hexane, water and ethyl acetate. For the determination of the antimicrobial activities, the agar well diffusion method was employed. Cytotoxicity was studied by brine shrimp lethality assay; antioxidant activities were measured using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl. The chloroform extract was active against Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis, the ethyl acetate extract had highest antibacterial spectrum against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the n-hexane extract had highest inhibition against E. aerogenes, the aqueous extract showed highest activities against P. mirabilis, the butanol fraction showed highest activities against E. aerogenes and the methanolic extract was highly active against P. mirabilis.
TI  - Infected hydatid cysts bacteria in slaughtered livestock and their effects on protoscoleces degeneration.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The protoscoleces of fertile hydatid cysts are considered as major risks in surgery and producing secondary cysts if rupture the cyst during operation and, cause infecting the dogs with adult worm if eaten by this animal. Bacterial infection of the hydatid fluid can lead to sterilization of the cyst. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the bacterial infection rate of livestock hydatid cysts in Hamedan, Iran, and test the isolated bacteria effects on viable protoscoleces, in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 5709 slaughtered livestock were inspected to detect the presence of hydatid cysts. The hydatid fluid of all cysts was cultured separately to isolate and identify the bacteria. The effect of isolated bacteria was tested on viable protoscoleces in culture tubes, in vitro. The culture tubes were observed and examined under a light microscope every two hours for 24 hours, and then, after 36 and 48 hours. RESULTS: Infected cysts were found in 74% of animals in Hamedan (46% were calcified and the bacteria was isolated from 52%) and 62% in Borujerd. The isolated bacteria in the infected cysts were as follows: Escherichia coli, E. blattae, Klebsiella pnoumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Edwardsiella tarda. The protoscoleces incubated with the isolated bacteria totally degenerated, but 55% of the protoscoleces in the control groups were intact and viable even after one week. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a high percentage of cysts bacterial infections in two provinces of Iran. The common isolated bacteria were E. coli and Klebsiella. The isolated bacteria degenerated the protoscoleces during short-time incubation, in vitro.
TI  - Infections in patients undergoing craniotomy: risk factors associated with post-craniotomy meningitis.
AB  - OBJECT The authors performed a prospective study to define the prevalence and microbiological characteristics of infections in patients undergoing craniotomy and to clarify the risk factors for post-craniotomy meningitis. METHODS Patients older than 18 years who underwent nonstereotactic craniotomies between January 2006 and December 2008 were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and microbiological data were systemically recorded. Patient characteristics, craniotomy type, and pre- and postoperative variables were evaluated as risk factors for meningitis RESULTS Three hundred thirty-four procedures were analyzed (65.6% involving male patients). Traumatic brain injury was the most common reason for craniotomy. Almost 40% of the patients developed at least 1 infection. Ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP) was the most common infection recorded (22.5%) and Acinetobacter spp. were isolated in 44% of the cases. Meningitis was encountered in 16 procedures (4.8%), and CSF cultures were positive for microbial growth in 100% of these cases. Gram-negative pathogens (Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloaceae, Proteus mirabilis) represented 88% of the pathogens. Acinetobacter and Klebsiella spp. demonstrated a high percentage of resistance in several antibiotic classes. In multivariate analysis, the risk for meningitis was independently associated with perioperative steroid use (OR 11.55, p = 0.005), CSF leak (OR 48.03, p < 0.001), and ventricular drainage (OR 70.52, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Device-related postoperative communication between the CSF and the environment, CSF leak, and perioperative steroid use were defined as risk factors for meningitis in this study. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was the most common infection overall. The offending pathogens presented a high level of resistance to several antibiotics.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of selected medicinal plants against multidrug resistant bacterial strains from clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial effect of Curcuma longa (C. longa), Zingiber officinale (Z. officinale) and Tinospora cordifolia (T. cordifolia) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis of clinical origin. METHODS: The antimicrobial efficacy of said medicinal plants and establishment of multidrug resistant character of these bacteria were carried out using disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods. RESULTS: The results of MIC and MBC showed that these clinical bacterial isolates were phenotypically multidrug resistant against standard antibiotics (>500 mug/mL). Compared to standard antibiotics, C. longa, Z. officinale and T. cordifolia were more effective in killing these microbes as evident from MIC and MBC values (5 to 125 mug/mL). Moreover, C. longa had highest antibacterial efficacy compared to Z. officinale and T. cordifolia. CONCLUSIONS: The result thus obtained suggests that bioactive principles of these plants can be used particularly against these multidrug resistant bacteria of clinical origin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of Mentha longifolia L. and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. plants against important human pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from Mentha longifolia L. (M. longifolia) and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. (Z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. METHODS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia), Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of M. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. RESULTS: The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/mL) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/mL) were observed by the aqueous extracts of M. longifolia. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it seems that Z. multiflora and M. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
TI  - [Current detection rates of multiresistant gramnegative bacteria (3MRGN, 4MRGN) in patients with chronic leg ulcers].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance in gram-negative pathogens, the Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention (KRINKO) decided to establish a new clinically oriented definition of multi-resistance. Gram-negative pathogens with a multidrug-resistance (MRGN) are divided into those with resistance to three (3MRGN) or four (4MRGN) antibiotic groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter study which was done in ten dermatological wound clinics, the bacteriological swabs from up to 100 patients with chronic leg ulcers per center were analyzed according to the current classification KRINKO and evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, the results of 970 patients (553 women, 417 men) could be evaluated. We found 681 gram-positive and 1155 gram-negative bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was with a detection-rate of 31.1% the most frequent gram-negative pathogen, followed by Proteus mirabilis with 13.7% and various enterobacteria with 28.6%. According to the current KRINKO classification,eight patients with 4MRGN and 34 patients with 3MRGN could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the current spectrum of bacteria in patients with chronic leg ulcers with a variety of gram-negative pathogens, some of which are classified as multi-drug resistant. As a clinical consequence some of the patients require individualized preventive measures and therapy.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method targeting bcfD gene.
AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Salmonella detection targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in Salmonella. The Salmonella LAMP assay we developed successfully amplified 44 Salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-Salmonella standard strains (Proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio parahemolyticus). The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. Our experiments show that the LAMP method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella LAMP assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect Salmonella targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene. The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. The Salmonella LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.
TI  - Preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity of biodegradable films prepared from carrageenan.
AB  - Carrageenan films have been formulated as a packaging material. Films plasticized with glycerol were loaded with citric acid (1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 %) for enhanced antimicrobial effects. Blank and citric acid loaded films were characterized by mechanical properties, scanning electron microscopy and contact angle. In addition, swelling and antibacterial studies were conducted to further characterize the films. Both blank and citric acid loaded films showed different morphology, high elasticity and acceptable tensile (mechanical) properties. These citric acid loaded films produced higher zones of inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Dickeya chrysanthemi strains compared to blank film.
TI  - Impact of minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints on local cumulative bacterial susceptibility data and antibiotic consumption.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bacteria depends on minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints issued by national and international breakpoint committees. The current study was performed in order to test the influence of different AST standards on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption. METHODS: Automated AST was performed with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. From each species 100 prospectively collected non-duplicate clinical isolates were tested and MIC data were interpreted according to the interpretation standards issued by DIN and EUCAST, respectively. In addition cumulative AST data from clinical isolates and antibiotic consumption were monitored before and after implementation of new EUCAST MIC breakpoints. RESULTS: The susceptibility rate of P. aeruginosa against piperacillin and gentamicin, and of C. freundii against piperacillin/tazobactam increased significantly, whereas the susceptibility rates of E. cloacae, S. marcescens, and M. morganii against ciprofloxacin decreased significantly after switching from DIN to EUCAST MIC breakpoints. These changes in the cumulative antibiotic resistance pattern were reflected by enhanced consumption of piperacillin/tazobactam after implementation of EUCAST MIC breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that changes of AST breakpoints have a significant influence on local cumulative AST data and on antibiotic consumption.
TI  - Preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  - The ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. A recombinantly produced CDH from Myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mM or 2 mM cellobiose as substrate. Biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by CDH when supplemented with 1mM cellobiose. The CDH/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, CDH was also able to produce H(2)O(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exPS) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. The H(2)O(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exPS were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. Hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for CDH as well as destabilises the biofilm. Furthermore, CDH suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. Incorporation of the CDH/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - Anti-biofilm activity of biogenic selenium nanoparticles and selenium dioxide against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of biologically synthesized selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) against the biofilm produced by clinically isolated bacterial strains compared to that of selenium dioxide. Thirty strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were isolated from various specimens of the patients hospitalized in different hospitals (Kerman, Iran). Quantification of the biofilm using microtiter plate assay method introduced 30% of S. aureus, 13% of P. aeruginosa and 17% of P. mirabilis isolates as severely adherent strains. Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of the purified Se NPs (produced by Bacillus sp. MSh-1) showed individual and spherical nano-structure in the size range of 80-220nm. Obtained results of the biofilm formation revealed that selenium nanoparticles inhibited the biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and P. mirabilis by 42%, 34.3%, and 53.4%, respectively, compared to that of the non-treated samples. Effect of temperature and pH on the biofilm formation in the presence of Se NPs and SeO2 was also evaluated.
TI  - The Antibacterial Activity of Cassia fistula Organic Extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cassia fistula, is a flowering plant and a member of Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound of 4 - 8 pairs of opposite leaflets. There are many Cassia species around the world which are used in herbal medicine. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine in vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula native to Khuzestan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial inhibitory effect of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula was tested on 3 Gram positive: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and 5 Gram negative: Salmonella Typhi, Kelebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis bacterial species using disc diffusion method at various concentrations. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were measured by the tube dilution assay. RESULTS: The extract of C. fistula was effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The most susceptible microorganisms to ethanolic and methanolic extracts were E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Also B. cereus and S. aureus showed the least sensitivity to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, respectively. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) of ethanolic extracts against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the obtained results and regarding to the daily increase of the resistant microbial strains to the commercial antibiotics, it can be concluded that these extracts can be proper candidates of antibacterial substance against pathogenic bacterial species especially S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with spinal cord injury: What we know and what we should know.
AB  - Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at increased risk for the development of pressure ulcers. These chronic wounds are debilitating and contribute to prolonged hospitalization and worse medical outcome. However, the species of bacteria and the role that specific species may play in delaying the healing of chronic pressure ulcers in the SCI population has not been well characterized. This study will review the literature regarding what is known currently about the bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with SCI. An electronic literature search of MEDLINE (1966 to February 2014) was performed. Eleven studies detailing bacterial cultures of pressure ulcers in the SCI population met inclusion criteria and were selected for review. Among these studies, bacterial cultures were often polymicrobial with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria identified with culture techniques that varied significantly. The most common organisms identified in pressure ulcers were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis. In general, wounds were poorly characterized with minimal to no physical description and/or location provided. Our present understanding of factors that may alter the microbiome of pressure ulcers in individuals with SCI is quite rudimentary, at best. Well-designed studies are needed to assess appropriate wound culture technique, the impact of bacterial composition on wound healing, development of infection, and the optimum medical and surgical approaches to wound care.
TI  - Bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  - The ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. Fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. Experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. A specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. Much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. The use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in China: SMART China 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends program monitors the activity of antibiotics against aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs) from intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) in patients worldwide. METHODS: In 2011, 1 929 aerobic and facultative GNBs from 21 hospitals in 16 cities in China were collected. All isolates were tested using a panel of 12 antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility was determined following the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Among the Gram-negative pathogens causing IAIs, Escherichia coli (47.3%) was the most commonly isolated, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (8.3%). Enterobacteriaceae comprised 78.8% (1521/1929) of the total isolates. Among the antimicrobial agents tested, ertapenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Enterobacteriaceae, with susceptibility rates of 95.1% and 94.4%, followed by amikacin (93.9%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (87.7%). Susceptibility rates of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime against Enterobacteriaceae were 38.3%, 38.3%, 61.1%, and 50.8%, respectively. The leastactive agent against Enterobacteriaceae was ampicillin/sulbactam (25.9%). The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates among E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis were 68.8%, 38.1%, 41.2%, and 57.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Enterobacteriaceae were the major pathogens causing IAIs, and the most active agents against the study isolates (including those producing ESBLs) were ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin. Including the carbapenems, most agents exhibited reduced susceptibility against ESBL-positive and multidrug-resistant isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in Vietnam: report from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART 2009-2011).
AB  - Treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. Limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from Vietnam. This study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in Vietnam during 2009-2011. A total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends. Antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods. Among the species collected, Escherichia coli (48.1% ESBL-positive) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% ESBL-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. Ertapenem MIC90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/mL and remained unchanged for ESBL-positive isolates. Imipenem MIC90 values were also the same for all isolates and ESBL-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/mL, respectively. Ertapenem MIC90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/mL, respectively. Analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that CTX-M variants, particularly CTX-M-27 and CTX-M-15, were the predominant enzymes. High resistance rates in Vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout Asia and globally.
TI  - Biofilms, flagella, and mechanosensing of surfaces by bacteria.
AB  - Formation of a bacterial biofilm is a developmental process that begins when a cell attaches to a surface, but how does a bacterial cell know it is on or near a surface in the first place? The phase of this 'swim-or-stick' switch is determined by a sensory transduction mechanism referred to as surface sensing, which involves the rotating bacterial flagellum. This review explores six bacterial species as models of flagellar mechanosensing of surfaces to understand the current state of our knowledge and the challenges that lie ahead. A common link between these bacteria is a requirement for the proper function of the flagellar motor stators that channel ions into the cell to drive flagellar rotation. Conditions that affect ion flow act as a signal that, ultimately, controls the master transcriptional regulatory circuits controlling the flagellar hierarchy and biofilm formation.
TI  - A survey of five broad-host-range plasmids in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To learn the prevalence of the primary classical broad-host-range (BHR) IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids in dominant gram-negative bacilli from inpatients in a teaching hospital in southern China. METHODS: A multiplex polymerase chain reaction based on the replicons of BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids was developed and used to determine these BHR plasmids. The difference in prevalence rates among the different species from three specimens was evaluated by a binary logistic regression model and the differences between multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) and non-MDRO were assessed using a chi-square test. RESULTS: The average positive detection percentages of the replicons were 4.3%, 3.7%, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, for IncN, IncP, IncQ, IncW, and IncA/C in descending order. The distribution of all five BHR plasmids did not differ significantly between specimens collected from wounds and urine, although both were significantly higher than those of sputum. The prevalence rates of all five BHR plasmids in MDROs were significantly higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae; however, no significant difference was seen in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB). CONCLUSIONS: BHR IncA/C, IncN, IncP, IncQ, and IncW plasmids, which occur more often in bacilli from wound and urine specimens than those of sputum, are widespread in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from inpatients. The prevalence rates in MDRO are higher than those in non-MDRO for Enterobacteriaceae but not significantly different for NFGNB.
TI  - Antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five Gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. METHODS: The correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. RESULTS: Among these five bacteria, overall E. coli and K. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, P. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. In contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis differed in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. K. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in P. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. P. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas A. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. CONCLUSION: The development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.
TI  - [Clinical distribution and antimicrobial resistance analysis of 754 pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility  patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers so as to provide selection rationales of antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from January 2010 to August 2013. The inter-group data were compared by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 322 (62.0%) males and 197 (38.0%) females. Their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40) years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and HbA1c (9.09% +/- 2.28%). Among 444 (85.5%) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3%, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3% vs 12.3%, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). With rising Wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. And 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Among 357 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. Staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. Among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of Escherichia coli, 34 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of Proteus vulgaris. And there were 29 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents. The predominant fungus was Blastomyces albicans. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, Gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence of fungus and composite infections increases. Vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. It is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.
TI  - Ceftolozane/tazobactam activity tested against aerobic Gram-negative organisms isolated from intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections in European and United States hospitals (2012).
AB  - Ceftolozane/tazobactam is under clinical development for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (IAI), complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia. We evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftolozane/tazobactam and comparator agents tested against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria causing IAI and healthcare-associated UTI (HCA-UTI). The organisms were consecutively collected from January to December 2012 from 59 medical centers located in the United States (USA) and 15 European countries by the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS). The collection included 809 organisms from IAI and 2474 organisms from HCA-UTI, and susceptibility testing was performed by reference broth microdilution methods as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M07-A9 document. Overall, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated pathogens from both infection types. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was very active against E. coli (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L; 98.5-99.9% inhibited at an MIC of </=8 mg/L) and retained activity against many of the multidrug-resistant (MDR; MIC50/90, 0.5/2->32 mg/L) and ESBL-phenotype strains (MIC50/90, 0.5/2-32 mg/L). Ceftolozane/tazobactam was active against most K. pneumoniae strains (MIC50/90, 0.25/16 mg/L, 88.9-89.6% inhibited at an MIC of </=8 mg/L), but some ESBL-phenotype (MIC50/90, 4-8/>32 mg/L) and MDR (MIC50/90, 16/>32 mg/L) isolates exhibited elevated MIC values. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was the most active agent tested against P. aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mg/L; 93.4-95.7% inhibited at </=8 mg/L) and retained potency against many MDR (MIC50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/L), ceftazidime-nonsusceptible (MIC50/90, 2-4/>32 mg/L) and meropenem-nonsusceptible (MIC50/90, 2/>32 mg/L) strains. Ceftolozane/tazobactam was also active against Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC50/90, </=0.12-0.25/0.5-1 mg/L), Enterobacter spp. (MIC50/90, 0.25-0.5/4-8 mg/L), Citrobacter spp. (MIC50/90, 0.25/2-32 mg/L), Proteus mirabilis (MIC50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/L), indole-positive Proteae (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5-1 mg/L), and Serratia spp. (MIC50/90, 0.5/1-2 mg/L). In summary, ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against contemporary aerobic Gram-negative pathogens causing IAI and HCA-UTI in USA and European medical centers.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - Epidemiological surveillance of bacterial nosocomial infections in the surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intensive care units (ICUs) are associated with a greater risk of developing nosocomial infections (NIs) than other departments. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the rate, the site and causative organisms of NIs in the surgical ICU at University Clinical Center Tuzla. METHODS: All patients admitted to the surgical ICU were followed prospectively, for the development of NIs (January-December 2010). Determination of NIs was performed using standardized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. RESULTS: 94 out of 834 patients (11.27%) developed NIs. Respiratory tract infections were seen in 56 (60%), urinary tract infections in 15 (16%) and gastrointestinal tract infections in 8 (9%) patients. Other infections identified were surgical site, bloodstream and skin infections. Gram-negative organisms were reported in approximately 75% of cases (78.7% extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producers). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the commonest (51.0%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (21.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.6%). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (16%), and Clostridium difficile (9.6%) were the commonest among gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Respiratory and urinary tract infections made up the great majority of NIs. ICU patients are more susceptible to NIs, emphasizing the importance of continuous surveillance and enforcement of specific infection control measures.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic evaluation of chronic leg ulcers: a cross-sectional study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at evaluating the flora and bacterial load of chronic leg ulcers (CLUs) according to the clinical judgment of colonization or infection. DESIGN: This was an analytical and cross-sectional study. SETTING: This study was conducted in an outpatient wound care unit in the Dermatology Department of the Botucatu School of Medicine-UNESP, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were patients with CLUs who did not use systemic antibiotics. METHODS: The ulcers were clinically divided into 3 groups: ulcers with good granulation tissue (GGT), critical colonization (CC), and infection. Secretion was collected from a 1-cm area using a swab and seeded by the semiquantitative method. OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were genus and species of the bacteria found in the cultures and result of the semiquantitative culture correlating with the clinical diagnosis of GGT, CC, and infection. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-seven ulcers were evaluated: 27 with GGT, 29 with CC, and 21 with infection. Gram-negative bacteria were most often found in all groups (81%): Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in granulation and colonized ulcers, and Proteus mirabilis, in infected ulcers. Ulcers from the infected group showed higher bacterial load. CONCLUSIONS: The flora of CLUs was predominantly constituted by gram-negative bacteria, and P aeruginosa was the most prevalent. The bacterial load of infected ulcers was higher as compared with the others, although some ulcers with GGT also presented a high load. The interpretation of microbiologic tests based on the swab techniques and even on semiquantitative analysis requires close clinical correlation.
TI  - Antibacterial Activities and In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory (Membrane Stability) Properties of Methanolic Extracts of Gardenia coronaria Leaves.
AB  - This work is carried out with Gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family Rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. Leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. The leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. Methanol extract from the leaves of Gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. The lower concentrations of Methanolic leaf extract of Gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with Kanamycin. The crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of Aspirin as positive control. The Methanolic extracts of Gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms like Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Shigella sonnei, Shigella boydii, and Proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. The extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.
TI  - A comparison of inpatient versus outpatient resistance patterns of pediatric urinary tract infection.
AB  - PURPOSE: Prior single center studies showed that antibiotic resistance patterns differ between outpatients and inpatients. We compared antibiotic resistance patterns for urinary tract infection between outpatients and inpatients on a national level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined outpatient and inpatient urinary isolates from children younger than 18 years using The Surveillance Network (Eurofins Scientific, Luxembourg, Luxembourg), a database of antibiotic susceptibility results, as well as patient demographic data from 195 American hospitals. We determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns of the 6 most common uropathogens, including Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus. We compared differences in uropathogen prevalence and resistance patterns for outpatient and inpatient isolates using chi-square analysis. RESULTS: We identified 25,418 outpatient (86% female) and 5,560 inpatient (63% female) urinary isolates. Escherichia coli was the most common uropathogen overall but its prevalence varied by gender and visit setting, that is 79% of uropathogens overall for outpatient isolates, including 83% of females and 50% of males, compared to 54% for overall inpatient isolates, including 64% of females and 37% of males (p <0.001). Uropathogen resistance to many antibiotics was lower in the outpatient vs inpatient setting, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 24% vs 30% and cephalothin 16% vs 22% for E. coli (each p <0.001), cephalothin 7% vs 14% for Klebsiella (p = 0.03), ceftriaxone 12% vs 24% and ceftazidime 15% vs 33% for Enterobacter (each p <0.001), and ampicillin 3% vs 13% and ciprofloxacin 5% vs 12% for Enterococcus (each p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Uropathogen resistance rates of several antibiotics are higher for urinary specimens obtained from inpatients vs outpatients. Separate outpatient vs inpatient based antibiograms can aid in empirical prescribing for pediatric urinary tract infections.
TI  - Bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. The disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. PID is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. This situation is not in any way different here in Nigeria and more so in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on PID. It therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of Nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), attending some hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. Antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. Organisms encountered were Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Escherichia coli (10%), Streptococcus faecalis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Proteus rettgeri (2%) and Proteus mirabilis (1%). The highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). The age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). There was a significant difference in the acquisition of PID in relation to marital status (P < 0.05). However there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (P > 0.05). Antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. Cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of PID due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. PID is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. There is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. PID hence can be said to be a very serious complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. The right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation. Treatment of PID should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. Immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with PID, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.
TI  - Mycosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles and their activity against some human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to biosynthesis silver nanoparticles from the fungus Nigrospora sphaerica isolated from soil samples and to examine their activity against five human pathogenic strains of bacteria viz. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus using disc diffusion method. The synergistic effect of silver nanoparticles in combination with commonly used antibiotic Gentamycin against the selected bacteria was also examined. The synthesized silver nanoparticles from free-cell filtrate were characterized by using UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). UV-Vis spectrophotometer analysis showed a peak at 420 nm indicating the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, FTIR analysis verified the detection of protein capping of silver nanoparticles while SEM micrographs revealed that the silver nanoparticles are dispersed and aggregated and mostly having spherical shape within the size range between 20 and 70 nm. The synthesized silver nanoparticles exhibited a varied growth inhibition activity (15-26 mm diam inhibition zones) against the tested pathogenic bacteria. A remarkable increase of bacterial growth inhibition (26-34 mm diam) was detected when a combination of silver nanoparticles and Gentamycin was used. A significant increase in fold area of antibacterial activity was observed when AgNPs in combination with Gentamycin was applied. The synthesized silver nanoparticles produced by the fungus N. sphaerica is a promising to be used as safe drug in medical therapy due to their broad spectrum against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - Chronic ulcers in Ikeja-Lagos, Nigeria: an eighteen month review of infecting bacterial agents and susceptibility pattern.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic ulcers are an important cause of morbidity among surgical and medical patients. Infection in ulcers may delay healing and cause septicemia resulting in mortality. Microbial studies are important for the appropriate management of these ulcers. OBJECTIVE: The study investigates on eighteen month review of infecting bacterial agents and susceptibility pattern in chronic ulcers in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: Details of all patients treated for ulcers that were investigated at the department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja-Lagos, Nigeria between July 1st 2009 and December 31, 2010 were retrieved from the computer database and transferred into the proforma designed for the study. Data collected were demography, date of onset of ulcer, mode of specimen collection, names of isolates and drug sensitivity patterns. RESULTS: A total of 329 cases were seen and reviewed during the study period. Males constituted 50.2%, females 38.3% and the gender of the remaining 11.6% were not indicated. There were 259 (78.7%) adults and 42 (12.8%) children. The ages of 28 cases were not indicated. Microbial growths were obtained in 217 (66.7%) patients. Gram negative (Gn) organisms were isolated in 181(83.5%) and Gram positive (Gp) in 35 (16%). The most common isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.1%) Staphylococcus aureus (9.7%), Proteus mirabilis (7.6%) and Escherichia coil (7.3%). There were widespread resistances by the isolates to the common antibiotics in the study environment. CONCLUSION: The wide spread resistance may be due to lack of an antibiotic use policy. Certain antibiotics should be reserved for second line treatment in the emergency setting
TI  - Development of a urinary-specific antibiogram for gram-negative isolates: impact  of patient risk factors on susceptibility.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional antibiograms guide clinicians in selecting appropriate empiric antimicrobials, but they lack data on syndrome/disease-specific susceptibility, isolate location, polymicrobial infections, and patient risk factors. The aim of this study was to develop a urinary-specific antibiogram and to evaluate the impact of risk factors on antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: This retrospective descriptive study used culture and susceptibility data from January 1 to December 31, 2012. A urinary antibiogram specific for Escherichia coli (EC), Proteus mirabilis (PM), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) was developed. Urinary and standard antibiogram susceptibilities were compared. Urinary isolates were then stratified by risk factors-residence before admission, age, systemic antimicrobial use for </=30 days, hospitalization for </=30 days, and hospital unit-to determine the impact on antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: There were 2,284 urinary isolate encounters. Overall antimicrobial susceptibility was increased, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates was significantly greater (KP, 14% vs 7% [P = .001]; EC, 13% vs 9% [P < .001]; PM, 18% vs 10% [P = .004]) in the urinary antibiogram vs the standard antibiogram. Health care facility residence had the greatest impact on susceptibility for all urinary isolates, especially on fluoroquinolone susceptibility for EC and PM. CONCLUSIONS: Using a syndromic antibiogram and incorporating patient risk factors into susceptibility data may be more useful in guiding clinicians in selecting more appropriate empiric therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of plazomicin against 5,015 gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals as part of the CANWARD study, 2011-2012.
AB  - Plazomicin is a next-generation aminoglycoside that is not affected by most clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. The in vitro activities of plazomicin and comparator antimicrobials were evaluated against a collection of 5,015 bacterial isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between January 2011 and October 2012. Susceptibility testing was performed using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method, with MICs interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints, when available. Plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with all species except Proteus mirabilis having an MIC90 of </=1 mug/ml. Plazomicin was active against aminoglycoside-nonsusceptible Escherichia coli, with MIC50 and MIC90 values identical to those for aminoglycoside-susceptible isolates. Furthermore, plazomicin demonstrated equivalent activities versus extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and non-ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 90% of the isolates inhibited by an MIC of </=1 mug/ml. The MIC50 and MIC90 values for plazomicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 4 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively, compared with 4 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively, for amikacin. Plazomicin had an MIC50 of 8 mug/ml and an MIC90 of 32 mug/ml versus 64 multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates. Plazomicin was active against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with both having MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.5 mug/ml and 1 mug/ml, respectively. In summary, plazomicin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a diverse collection of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci obtained over a large geographic area. These data support further evaluation of plazomicin in the clinical setting.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - The need for culture swabs in laparoscopically treated appendicitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Appendicitis remains the most common cause of an acute abdomen. Obtaining intra-abdominal cultures is routine surgical practice. There are studies showing no efficacy of such procedures in cases where open appendectomies are performed. AIM: The goal of this study was to assess the need for obtaining intra-abdominal cultures during laparoscopic appendectomies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2012, 369 patients were operated on with the diagnosis of histopathologically proven acute appendicitis. Sixty-two percent of them were operated on using laparoscopic techniques. The microbiological assessment was routinely done for the open procedures and in 42% of cases that underwent a laparoscopic operation. RESULTS: In 57% (134) the swabbing results were negative. Among 43% (102) of the patients with a positive result, Escherichia coli was isolated in 76.5% (78), Proteus mirabilis in 13.7% (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 4.9% (5) and Citrobacter freundii in 4.9% (5). Five cases had bacteria resistant to the antibiotic given preoperatively (that is 4.9% of all positive cultures and 1.4% of all operated patients). However, these cases did not affect the incidence of postoperative complications. Consideration of the postoperative morbidity showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the laparoscopic group with and without intra-operative swabbing (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The postoperative patient outcome was more dependent on the pathology of the appendix than on the results of the microbiological assessment at the time of surgery. Hence, routine intra-operative cultures during laparoscopic appendectomies appear to have little value in patient management. Swabbing during laparoscopic procedures should be limited to only selected high-risk groups.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of isolates from paediatric intensive care units in Zagreb.
AB  - AIM: Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program is a longitudinal global surveillance study to monitor in vitro data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. Results of the six years period (2002-2007) for the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents against Gram-negative and Gram-positive isolates collected at pediatric intensive care units of the University Hospital Center Zagreb in Croatia were reported. METHODS: A total of 110 Gram-negative and 43 Gram-positive pathogens from pediatric specimens were tested. The minimum-inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI. RESULTS: There was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. High resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and gentamicin (50%) are a raising concern. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant Gram-negative species with two (12%) of the strains resistant to meropenem, three (18%) to imipenem, 10 (47%) to gentamicin and six (35%) to piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. According to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria in pediatric population. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that meropenem has excellent potency and spectrum of activity despite being prescribed for a long time for the treatment of seriously ill patients, and still appears to be a reliable option for the initial empirical therapy of serious nosocomial infections in children. However, later studies have shown the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria after 2008.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative organisms isolated from patients hospitalized in intensive care units in United States and European hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  - Treatment of infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) represents a great challenge, especially those caused by Gram-negative organisms. Rapid introduction of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is crucial to reduce mortality; resistance rates in the ICU can be elevated due to antimicrobial selection pressure. We evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients hospitalized in ICUs (ICU patients). The isolates were consecutively collected as part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program from January 2009 to December 2011 and tested for susceptibility to multiple antimicrobial agents at a central laboratory by reference broth microdilution methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility results for 5989 bacterial isolates from ICU patients (3445 from the United States [USA] and 2544 from Europe [EU]) were analyzed and compared to those of 17,244 organisms from non-ICU patients (9271 from USA and 7973 from EU). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequently isolated organisms from ICU patients, followed by Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility rates were generally lower among ICU isolates compared to non-ICU organisms. E. coli isolates from ICU patients exhibited elevated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype rates (13.7% in USA and 16.6% in EU); furthermore, only amikacin (90.5-94.8% susceptibility), colistin (99.8-100.0% inhibited at </=2 mug/mL), imipenem (95.5-96.0%), meropenem (95.4-95.8%), and tigecycline (96.3-98.0%) exhibited good activity against Klebsiella spp. ESBL-phenotype rates have increased among both E. coli and Klebsiella spp. from ICU patients in the USA and in Europe, with the most noticeable increase among Klebsiella spp. from Europe (from 27.5% in 2009 to 41.8% in 2011; P = 0.015 and odds ratio = 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.18]). Meropenem susceptibility among Klebsiella spp. improved slightly in the USA but decreased markedly in Europe from 100.0% in 2009 to 89.7% in 2011. Only colistin (99.4% susceptible) and amikacin (97.3% in USA and 84.9% in EU) exhibited good activity against P. aeruginosa strains from ICU patients. The greatest differences in susceptibility rates between P. aeruginosa strains from ICU and non-ICU patients were observed for the anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, such as ceftazidime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The results of this study (101 medical centers) highlight major antimicrobial coverage problems and trends in antimicrobial resistance for USA and EU ICU patient isolates.
TI  - [One-year surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance in major bacteria except for MRSA isolated in eight medical facilities in Kumamoto prefecture].
AB  - To investigate the current status of drug-resistant bacteria (except MRSA) in Kumamoto prefecture, a study was conducted to determine the isolation numbers and ratios of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-Escherichia coli, ESBL-Klebsiella species, ESBL-Proteus mirabilis, two-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, (resistant to two drugs either carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides) multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and vancomyacin-resistant Enterococcii in eight general hospitals from May in 2009 to April in 2010. ESBL-E. coli was mostly isolated, and two-drug resistant P. aeruginosa came second. The isolation ratio of overall drug-resistant bacteria did not increase, while the isolation ratio of two-drugs resistant P. aeruginosa declined, suggesting that infection control was successfully conducted in these hospitals. However, the isolation numbers of ESBL-Klebsiella spp. and two-drug resistant P. aeruginosa were variable in each hospital. Furthermore, drug-resistant bacteria were occasionally spread into another medical facilities by patients transferred from these hospitals, indicating that sharing information on drug-resistant bacteria between medical facilities is required.

TI  - The antibacterial activity of geranium oil against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from difficult-to-heal wounds.
AB  - Hard-to-heal wounds represent a significant problem to patients, health care professionals, and health care system. They can be formed as a result of mechanical injuries and burns, and any co-existing chronic disease increases the risk of their emergence. Diabetics are at a greater risk of developing chronic wounds because of poor circulation, slow healing times, vascular disease and neuropathy. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of geranium oil against Gram-negative bacterial clinical strains. Clinical strains were isolated from patients with difficult-to-treat wounds and a comprehensive evaluation of their sensitivity to antibiotics was carried out. The constituents of geranium oil were specified by GC-FID-MS analysis. The micro-dilution broth method was used to check the inhibition of microbial growth at various concentrations of geranium oil. The tested geranium oil was efficacious against Gram-negative pathogens responsible for problems with wound treatment. The results suggest that geranium oil may be considered an effective component of therapy in the case of frequent recurrences of infections caused by resistant pathogens.
TI  - Inhibition of biofilm development of uropathogens by curcumin - an anti-quorum sensing agent from Curcuma longa.
AB  - Urinary tract infection is caused primarily by the quorum sensing (QS)-dependent  biofilm forming ability of uropathogens. In the present investigation, an anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS) agent curcumin from Curcuma longa (turmeric) was shown to inhibit the biofilm formation of uropathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens, possibly by interfering with their QS systems. The antibiofilm potential of curcumin on uropathogens as well as its efficacy in disturbing the mature biofilms was examined under light microscope and confocal laser scanning microscope. The treatment with curcumin was also found to attenuate the QS-dependent factors, such as exopolysaccharide production, alginate production, swimming and swarming motility of uropathogens. Furthermore, it was documented that curcumin enhanced the susceptibility of a marker strain and uropathogens to conventional antibiotics.
TI  - Avibactam reverts the ceftazidime MIC90 of European Gram-negative bacterial clinical isolates to the epidemiological cut-off value.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftazidime-avibactam consists of the beta-lactam ceftazidime and the novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam. The effect of avibactam on the ceftazidime MIC frequency distribution of Gram-negative European clinical isolates was observed and compared to European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) MIC frequency distributions and epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) listed for ceftazidime. METHODS: Ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam MICs were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference broth microdilution methods for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Enterobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolates collected from medical centres in Europe during 2009. RESULTS: The MIC(90) values for ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam against P. aeruginosa isolates from a 2009 European surveillance programme were >32 and 8 mg/l, respectively. That is, the presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for P. aeruginosa to the ECOFF. Similarly, the MIC(90) values for ceftazidime against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and P. mirabilis were also reduced to the ECOFF by the presence of avibactam. Avibactam reduced the ceftazidime MIC(90) value against collected Enterobacter spp. to 1 mg/l (>32-fold reduction). No ECOFF has been defined for Enterobacter spp. however, it is 1 mg/l for Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of avibactam reverted the ceftazidime MIC(90) for Gram-negative bacteria to the ECOFF.
TI  - Autocatalytic growth of biofunctionalized antibacterial silver nanoparticles.
AB  - Development of eco-friendly processes for nanosynthesis is gaining importance owing to the widespread application of nanoparticles (NPs). In the present study, we have explained the mechanism and kinetics of bioreduction in the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous leaf extract of Rhizophora apiculata. Spectrophotometric methods were employed to quantify the bioactive molecules present before and after the reduction process. The results showed that the polyphenols were the main components responsible for the biosynthesis of AgNPs, which was further confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The kinetics of formation of AgNPs were monitored by time-resolved spectrophotometric and X-ray diffraction studies, which revealed that the NP formation is an autocatalytic process with a rate constant of 1.9 x 10(-2) Min(-1) . The NPs were characterized using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques like ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The biogenic AgNPs showed substantial inhibitory activity to Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration values of 2.5, 12.5, 2.5, and 31.25 mug/mL, respectively. The current research provides an insight into the mechanistic aspects of bioreduction and formation of AgNPs.
TI  - Frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteremia isolates in patients with urinary tract infection: results from United States and European hospitals (2009-2011).
AB  - We evaluated the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients with UTI from European (EU) and United States (USA) hospitals during a 3-year period (2009-2011). Susceptibility testing was performed by the reference broth microdilution method on 2071 Gram-negative bacilli. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (63.3/71.3% in USA/EU), Klebsiella spp. (16.7/11.2%) and Proteus mirabilis (6.4/5.0%). Escherichia coli susceptibility rates were generally similar in the USA and EU, with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype rates at 8.1% in both regions. Among Klebsiella spp., ESBL rates varied from 11.4/17.1% in 2009 to 16.1/40.4% in 2011 in USA/EU, and susceptibility rates were generally lower in EU compared to the USA. Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited lower susceptibility rates to ceftazidime, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam in EU (78.4, 78.4 and 76.5%, respectively) compared to USA (91.2, 88.2 and 91.2%, respectively). In summary, very few antimicrobials provided satisfactory coverage (>90%) when tested against Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa isolates in EU.
TI  - Phytochemical study and screening for antimicrobial activity of flavonoids of Euphorbia hirta.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to phytochemical and antimicrobial study of Euphorbia  hirta Euphorbiaceae). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of flavonoids (free and bound) of Euphorbia hirta L. was determined by disc diffusion assay against four bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus) and four fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Candida albicans). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract was evaluated through micro broth dilution method, while minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration was determined by subculturing the relevant samples. Total activity (TA) of extracts against each sensitive pathogen was also evaluated. RESULTS: Out of fungi; A. flavus, A. niger, and T. mentagrophytes were found to be resistant, against which none of the tested extracts showed activity. Bound flavonoids extract of root showed best activity against C. albicans (inhibition zone (IZ) 27.66, MIC 0.039, minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) 0.039). TA of free flavonoid extract of root was found to be the same for P. mirabilis and S. aureus (192.30 ml/g). Two flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol were identified in the bound flavonoids of stem extract which showed activity against all the microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Results of the present investigation indicate that E. hirta has good antimicrobial activity with low range of MIC, hence can be exploited for future plant-based antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative aerobic bacilli from intra-abdominal pathogens to antimicrobial agents collected in the United States during 2011.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During 2011, a total of 1442 gram-negative pathogens from intra-abdominal infections were collected as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) from 19 hospital sites within the United States. Susceptibility to ertapenem and comparators and molecular analysis of ertapenem resistant isolates was performed. METHODS: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ESBL (ESBL) isolates were determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute's recommended phenotypic test. Isolates were identified to the species level, and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using custom MicroScan dehydrated broth microdilution panels ESBLs and carbapenemases were characterized using the Check-Points microarray. Strain typing of Klebsiella pneumoniae was performed by rep-PCR on the DiversiLab System. RESULTS: The majority of isolates were Escherichia coli (36%), K. pneumoniae (18.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%) and Enterobacter cloacae (8.4%). Incidence of ESBL-positive isolates was 12.7%, 9.7%, 3.6% and 3.1% for K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. Against the majority of isolates and species tested, the most active antibiotics were amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem, with the carbapenems being the most active in vitro, including against ESBL-positive isolates of E. coli. All other antibiotics exhibited diminished activity. Against K. pneumoniae, the carbapenems were notably less active against ESBL-positive isolates though their activity against this sub-population was still the highest of all antibiotics tested; however, 41.1% (14 of 34) of the phenotypically ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae co-produced a carbapenemase (KPC2 or KPC3), and >90% of the isolates producing only an ESBL remained susceptible to ertapenem. CONCLUSIONS: Further monitoring of susceptibility of intra-abdominal isolates is warranted due to limited therapeutic options available to physicians.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Potential of the Lichen Parmotrema sp. Extracts against Various Pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): The ongoing increasing antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest  challenges faced by global public health. The perennial need for new antimicrobials against a background of increasing antibiotic resistance in pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms obliges the scientific community to constantly develop new drugs and antimicrobial agents. Lichens are known prolific sources of natural antimicrobial drugs and biologically active natural products. This study was aimed to explore in vitro antimicrobial activity of lichen Parmotrema sp. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The methanol and aqueous extracts of lichen Parmotrema sp. was extracted using Soxhlet extractor. Antibiotic assessment of methanol and aqueous extracts was done against eight bacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Enterococci faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae,) clinical pathogens and five plant pathogenic fungal strains (Aspergillus terreus strain JAS1, Scedosporium sp. JAS1, Ganoderma sp. JAS4, Candida tropicalis and Fusarium sp.) by Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: The methanol lichen Parmotrema sp. extract inhibited all the test organisms. The highest antibacterial activity was found against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The weakest activity was manifested in Salmonella sp. and Scedosporium sp. JAS1. Strong antifungal effect was found against Ganoderma sp. JAS4 and Fusarium sp. The aqueous lichen Parmotrema sp. extract revealed neither antibacterial nor antifungal activity. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that tested lichen Parmotrema sp. extracts demonstrated a strong antimicrobial effect. That suggests the active components from methanol extracts of the investigated lichen Parmotrema sp. can be used as natural antimicrobial agent against pathogens.
TI  - Deep wound infections after spinal fusion in children with cerebral palsy: a prospective cohort study.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort. OBJECTIVE: To (1) calculate the rate of deep wound infection in children with cerebral palsy (CP) after spinal fusion surgery; (2) identify factors (patient, laboratory, and surgical) associated with deep wound infection development; and (3) report causative organisms. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Wound infection after spine fusion for CP is more common than after spine fusion for most other diagnoses. METHODS: We prospectively gathered data on 204 consecutive pediatric patients with CP who underwent surgery at 7 institutions. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed to analyze patient, laboratory, and surgical characteristics to identify factors that were significantly associated with infection development. Statistical significance was set at a value of P less than 0.05. RESULTS: Deep wound infection developed in 13 (6.4%) children. The mean time to infection development was 34.2 +/- 60.2 days. On univariate analysis, older age, larger curve size, presence of gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy tube, higher preoperative serum white blood cell count, and longer operative time were significantly associated with deep wound infection. On multivariate analysis, only the presence of a gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy tube remained significant (1.9-fold risk of deep wound infection compared with patients without tubes). Escherichia coli was the most common organism cultured from the wound sites (5 patients). Other infective agents were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (1), Proteus mirabilis (1), and polymicrobial organisms (4). CONCLUSION: Deep wound infection occurred in 6.4% of children with CP after spinal fusion. The presence of a gastrostomy/gastrojejunostomy tube was a significant predictor of infection. Gram-negative organisms were the most common causative agents. Surgeons should be cognizant of these factors when treating children with CP and may consider Gram-negative antibiotic prophylaxis.
TI  - Bacteriological pathogen spectrum of chronic leg ulcers: Results of a multicenter trial in dermatologic wound care centers differentiated by regions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In almost every chronic wound different bacteria species can be detected. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter evaluation of bacterial swab results from 2010 and 2011 in patients with chronic leg ulcer treated in 10 dermatologic wound care centers from 5 regions in Germany. RESULTS: Data of 970 patients were analyzed. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 47.6 % of the patients, 8.6% of these were methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in 31.1 %, enterobacteria in 28.6 % and Proteus mirabilis in 13.7 % of the patients. The regional comparison showed a significant south-north gradient for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and enterobacteria. Moreover, a highly significant west-east gradient for MRSA was found with detection rates of 13.5 % in the west to 4.0 % in the east. Furthermore, nationally there was a significant negative correlation between S. aureus and P. aeruginosa or P. mirabilis, respectively, as well as a positive correlation of P. aeruginosa with respect to wound size and duration. In addition to climatic and therapeutic conditions, different regional health care structures are discussed as potentially relevant reasons for these significantly different regional detection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the regional variability of the spectrum of currently detected bacteria in patients with chronic leg ulcers in Germany.
TI  - Class D beta-lactamases: a reappraisal after five decades.
AB  - Despite 70 years of clinical use, beta-lactam antibiotics still remain at the forefront of antimicrobial chemotherapy. The major challenge to these life-saving therapeutics is the presence of bacterial enzymes (i.e., beta-lactamases) that can hydrolyze the beta-lactam bond and inactivate the antibiotic. These enzymes can be grouped into four classes (A-D). Among the most genetically diverse are the class D beta-lactamases. In this class are beta-lactamases that can inactivate the entire spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). Class D beta-lactamases are mostly found in Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , Proteus mirabilis , and Acinetobacter baumannii . The active-sites of class D beta-lactamases contain an unusual N-carboxylated lysine post-translational modification. A strongly hydrophobic active-site helps create the conditions that allow the lysine to combine with CO2, and the resulting carbamate is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds. The carboxy-lysine plays a symmetric role in the reaction, serving as a general base to activate the serine nucleophile in the acylation reaction, and the deacylating water in the second step. There are more than 250 class D beta-lactamases described, and the full set of variants shows remarkable diversity with regard to substrate binding and turnover. Narrow-spectrum variants are most effective against the earliest generation penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalothin. Extended-spectrum variants (also known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ESBLs) pose a more dangerous clinical threat as they possess a small number of substitutions that allow them to bind and hydrolyze later generation cephalosporins that contain bulkier side-chain constituents (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime). Mutations that permit this versatility seem to cluster in the area surrounding an active-site tryptophan resulting in a widened active-site to accommodate the oxyimino side-chains of these cephalosporins. More concerning are the class D beta-lactamases that hydrolyze clinically important carbapenem beta-lactam drugs (e.g., imipenem). Whereas carbapenems irreversibly acylate and inhibit narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, class D carbapenemases are able to recruit and activate a deacylating water. The rotational orientation of the C6 hydroxyethyl group found on all carbapenem antibiotics likely plays a role in whether the deacylating water is effective or not. Inhibition of class D beta-lactamases is a current challenge. Commercially available inhibitors that are active against other classes of beta-lactamases are ineffective against class D enzymes. On the horizon are several compounds, consisting of both beta-lactam derivatives and non-beta-lactams, that have the potential of providing novel leads to design new mechanism-based inactivators that are effective against the class D enzymes. Several act synergistically when given in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, and others show a unique mechanism of inhibition that is distinct from the traditional beta-lactamase inhibitors. These studies will bolster structure-based inhibitor design efforts to facilitate the optimization and development of these compounds as class D inactivators.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity and Phytochemical Constituents of Leaf Extracts of Cassia  auriculata.
AB  - Plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'For centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. In the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of Cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except Pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). The aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'Zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). The extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. The antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. Further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from Cassia auriculata.
TI  - Electrokinetic stringency control in self-assembled monolayer-based biosensors for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis.
AB  - Rapid detection of bacterial pathogens is critical toward judicious management of infectious diseases. Herein, we demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis. The in situ electrokinetic stringency control technique generates Joule heating induced temperature rise and electrothermal fluid motion directly on the sensor to improve its performance for detecting bacterial 16S rRNA, a phylogenetic biomarker. The dependence of the hybridization efficiency reveals that in situ electrokinetic stringency control is capable of discriminating single-base mismatches. With electrokinetic stringency control, the background noise due to the matrix effects of clinical urine samples can be reduced by 60%. The applicability of the system is demonstrated by multiplex detection of three uropathogenic clinical isolates with similar 16S rRNA sequences. The results demonstrate that electrokinetic stringency control can significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the biosensor for multiplex urinary tract infection diagnosis. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Urinary tract infections remain a significant cause of mortality and morbidity as secondary conditions often related to chronic diseases or to immunosuppression. Rapid and sensitive identification of the causative organisms is critical in the appropriate management of this condition. These investigators demonstrate an in situ electrokinetic stringency control approach for a self-assembled monolayer-based electrochemical biosensor toward urinary tract infection diagnosis, establishing that such an approach significantly improves the biosensor's signal-to-noise ratio.
TI  - Convenient syntheses of cyanuric chloride-derived NHC ligands, their Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Convenient syntheses of mono- and bis-imidazolium 1,3,5-triazine derivatives bearing piperidine and morpholine substituents are reported. In situ deprotonation of the mono-imidazolium salts and reaction with Ag2O or Au(tht)Cl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) precursors affords the corresponding Ag(NHC)Cl and Au(NHC)Cl carbene complexes. In the presence of Ag(I) or Au(I) salts the bis-imidazolium pincers eliminate the imidazolium group to afford -OMe or -NMe2 substituted triazines depending on the solvent used. In solution, the Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes show a barrier to rotation about the Ctriazine-Namine bonds, with calculated DeltaG( not equal) barriers in the region of 70 kJ mol(-1). Single crystal X-ray structures of several of the proligands and their corresponding Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes were obtained. These universally reveal an extended, rigidly planar pi-conjugated network between the triazine core, imidazolium/imidazolylidene substituents and exocyclic amine functions, to which the origin of the rotational barrier observed in solution is attributed. Only very weak Ntriazine-metal interactions are observed in the solid state, as indicated by small deviations of the CNHC-Ag-Cl bond angles from 180 degrees and also supported by DFT calculations on the Ag(NHC)Cl complex (NHC = 4,6-dipiperidinyl-2-methylimidazolylidene triazine). Preliminary antimicrobial susceptibility studies against five microorganisms (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 13277, S. aureus NCTC 6571, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 10662, Proteus mirabilis NCTC 11938 and Candida albicans ATCC 90028) show that the above triazine-based Ag-NHC complexes are active antimicrobial and antifungal agents.
TI  - Microorganisms' colonization and their antibiotic resistance pattern in oro - tracheal tube.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recently, nosocomial infections have been discussed as a critical issue among intubated patients leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Hence, the pattern of microbiological colonization and antibiotic resistance are much valuable in this regard. We aimed to investigate the pattern of microorganism colonization and antibiotic resistance in patients with endotracheal tube or tracheostomy to propose a proper empirical antibiotic therapy in this setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross sectional study was conducted among 880 patients admitted in Imam Khomeini hospital between 2008 and 2011 who were subsequently intubated or underwent tracheostomy due to insufficient self ventilation. Samples for microbiological cultures were obtained after extubation and then sent to the central laboratory for further assessment. Antibiograms and microbiological cultures were obtained for each sample. RESULTS: Of 880 patients enrolled in this study, 531 (60.3%) were male and 349 (39.7%) were female. Nineteen different organisms were isolated including Acinetobacter (213, 24.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (147, 16.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (106, 12%), Proteus mirabilis (90, 10.2%), and other organisms (324, 36.8%). Antibiotic resistance was mainly seen in Acinetobacter (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidim, cefepim, and penicillin), S. aureus (imipenem) and Klebsiella (pipracillintazobactam and ampicillin-sulbactam). CONCLUSION: This study represents the most common microorganisms colonizing tracheal tube of hospitalized patients and their pattern of antibiotic resistance. Acinetobacter was the most common microorganism isolated from endotracheal tube. Hence, it may be possible to initiate the empiric antibiotic treatment before the results of culture are become available. Ciprofloxacin was also the most prevalent antibiotic revealing resistant pattern. Moreover, most of the microorganisms were sensitive to imipenem and pipracillin-tazobactam.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - Double trouble: preseptal cellulitis due to two species with multidrug resistance.
AB  - A 2 Year old boy presented with painful ballooning of both eyes with the 2 days history of trauma to the head while playing. His vaccination was complete. On examination he was afebrile. The Eyes were ballooned with blackish crust over both lids. On local examination, eye swelling was tense with severe tenderness. The diagnosis of Preseptal cellulitis was made .We did an Emergency drainage and pus was sent for culture that came out to be positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis with multiple drug resistance. The coverage was given by Imipenem+cilastatin and child had wonderful recovery.
TI  - Chronic otorrhoea: spectrum of microorganisms and antibiotic sensitivity in a South African cohort.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic otorrhoea is difficult to treat, with treatment in South Africa (SA) being protocol driven and generally initiated at the primary healthcare level. There is a lack of local studies that focus on the bacteriology and antimicrobial sensitivities of chronic otorrhoea, which underpins the management advice offered. AIMS: To determine the microbiological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility of patients with chronic otorrhoea and the validity of the Department of Health's (DoH) current guideline. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study at Groote Schuur Hospital from 2005 to 2009. We included patients with chronic otorrhoea classified as either otitis media or otitis externa, according to our definitions. Pus swabs were taken, from which microorganisms were cultured and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Of 79 patients with otorrhoea, 50 had otitis media, 21 had otitis externa and the condition was not determined in 8 patients. The most common organism isolated with otitis media was Proteus mirabilis (18/50; 36%) and with otitis externa, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7/21; 33%). Otorrhoea had a different microbial spectrum compared with international reports, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in a single patient. The organisms isolated were susceptible mainly to fluoroquinolones (96%) and aminoglycosides (81%). CONCLUSION: Amoxicillin is a poor choice of antibiotic due to its low sensitivity, which calls into question the current DoH guideline for otorrhoea. Antimicrobial treatment protocols should be based on local data and be revisited from time to time. This study suggests that, should first-line treatment fail, an antibiotic with Gram-negative cover, e.g. a topical fluoroquinolone, should be considered.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium L.) leaves and flowers.
AB  - Since the aetiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP) is still unknown, the use of medicinal herb extracts and products prepared thereof are recommended due to their antimicrobial activity, especially during early stages of BHP. A comparison was performed of the in vitro antimicrobial activity (using broth microdilution assay) of flowers and leaves of willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium L., Onagraceae) from Mt. Velebit (Croatia). The strains (standard ATCC and clinical isolates) of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli (including p-fimbriae positive strain), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. dubliniensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were susceptible with MIC values between 4.6+/-0.2 and 18.2+/-0.8 mg/mL. The results of in vitro studies showed that no differences were found in the antimicrobial activity between the ethanol extracts of leaves and flowers of E. angustifolium. Using the quantitative fluorescent assay with ethidium bromide and acridine orange, the viability of C. albicans ATCC 10231 was assessed after in vitro exposure to E. angustifolium leaf and flower ethanol extracts. Apoptosis of C. albicans blastospores dominated over necrosis in all treated samples after short-term exposure with 6 to 12 mg/mL of extracts. In addition to the valuable biological activity of E. angustifolium extracts, the data obtained from the in vitro diffusion, the dilution assay and antifungal viability fluorescent assay suggest that leaf and flower ethanol extracts of E. angustifolium L. are a promising complementary herbal therapy of conditions such as BHP.
TI  - The joint in vitro action of polymyxin B and miconazole against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa from three European countries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Canine otitis externa, an inflammation of the external ear canal, can be maintained and worsened by bacterial or fungal infections. For topical treatment, combinations of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredients are mainly used. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to elucidate the in vitro activity of polymyxin B and miconazole against clinical bacterial isolates from three European countries, to investigate possible differences in sensitivity and to assess drug interactions. ANIMALS: Seventeen strains of Escherichia coli, 24 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 25 strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs with diagnosed otitis externa had been isolated in Germany, France and Italy. METHODS: Drug activities were evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration. The potentiation of polymyxin B plus miconazole was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). An FICI </=0.5 defined synergy. Furthermore, geographical variations in the FICI and MIC were assessed by statistical analysis. RESULTS: Bacterial susceptibilities were comparable in different European countries, because there were no significant MIC and FICI variations (P > 0.05). As a single agent, polymyxin B had bactericidal activity against most E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains and, in higher concentrations, against S. pseudintermedius strains. Miconazole was bactericidal against all Staphylococcus strains. Synergy was demonstrated against strains of E. coli and P. aeruginosa (FICI = 0.25 and 0.50, respectively), whereas overall there was no interaction against S. pseudintermedius strains (FICI = 1.25). Proteus mirabilis strains were not inhibited by each of the drugs individually or by their combination. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In vitro synergy of polymyxin B and miconazole against E. coli and P. aeruginosa isolates indicates a rationale for applying both agents in combination to treat otitis externa when infected with these types of bacteria.
TI  - In-Vitro, Anti-Bacterial Activities of Aqueous Extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo Against Gram Positive and Gram Negative Bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluations of the in-vitro anti-bacterial activities of aqueous extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and Shilajita mumiyo against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are reasonable since these ethnomedicinal plants have been used in Persian folk medicine for treating skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders for ages. METHODS: The well diffusion method (KB testing) with a concentration of 250 mug/disc was used for evaluating the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Maximum synergistic effects of different combinations of components were also observed. RESULTS: A particular combination of Acacia catechu (L.F.) Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo extracts possesses an outstanding anti-bacterial activity. It's inhibiting effect on microorganisms is significant when compared to the control group (P< 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive microorganism. The highest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) or gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was exerted by formula number 2 (Table1). CONCLUSION: The results reveal the presence of antibacterial activities of Acacia catechu, Castanea sativa husk, Ephedra sp. and Mumiyo against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Synergistic effects in a combined formula, especially in formula number 2 (ASLAN()) can lead to potential sources of new antiseptic agents for treatment of acute or chronic skin ulcers. These results considering the significant antibacterial effect of the present formulation, support ethno-pharmacological uses against diarrheal and venereal diseases and demonstrate use of these plants to treat infectious diseases.
TI  - Plant-based hydrocarbon esters from Tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from Tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. Among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. pseudomallei, Alcaligens viscolactis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. For example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (MIC of 7.8 microg/ml) against A. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (MIC of 15.6 microg/ml) against P. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (MIC of 31.25 microg/ml) on B. pseudomallei. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an XTT assay. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. The 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. Interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. In conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from T. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. In majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. Thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. This study was designed to find out the etiological agents of UTI and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. This study was conducted in Kathmandu Model Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal from April to October, 2009. Midstream Urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of UTI were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were analyzed using SPSS software window version 16. The overall prevalence of UTI was found to be 18.89%. The most frequent causative organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (82.30%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), Citrobacter freundii (3.60%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (2.40%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), Proteus mirabilis (0.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). Nitrofurantoin and Amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. E. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of UTI and Nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.
TI  - Bacteria species identification by the statistical analysis of bacterial colonies Fresnel patterns.
AB  - It was demonstrated that statistical analysis of bacteria colonies Fresnel patterns recorded in the optical system with converging spherical wave illumination is suitable for highly effective bacteria species classification. The proposed method includes Fresnel patterns recording followed by image processing and the statistical analysis based on feature extraction, feature selection, classification and classification performance methods. Examination performed on various bacteria species (Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter freundii) revealed that the proposed method achieved very high accuracy of over 98%.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - [Comparative study of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from burned patients during two periods (2005-2008, 2008-2011) and in two hospitals (Hospital Aziza Othmana, Trauma and Burn Center)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring of the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance of the main bacteria involved in nosocomial infections helps improve treatment and prevention strategies. AIM: To compare the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of the main bacterial isolates within the burned patients over two periods of 3 years and in two hospitals. METHODS: During two three-year periods: period 1 (P1): 1/7/2005-30/6/2008 and period 2 (P2): 1/7/2008-30/6/2011) and in two hospitals: Hospital Aziza Othmana (HAO) and the traumatology and burn center (CTGB), 2153 and 3719 non-repetitive strains were isolated from burn patients from different samples. The transfer of the intensive care unit was made on 01/07/2008 from the Hospital Aziza Othmana to CTGB. The study of antibiotic sensitivity was performed according to CA-SFM. RESULTS: During the period P1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the main bacteria isolated (18%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (12%). After the transfer of intensive care burn unit to the traumatology center, ecology bacterial varied with S. aureus (20%) in the first place followed by P. aeruginosa (15%) and Proteus mirabilis (11%). The study of the evolution of antibiotic susceptibility showed an overall downward trend of resistance in the second half of 2008, immediately after the transfer of service in the new hospital structure. The rate of ceftazidim resistant Klebsilella pneumoniae decreased from 80.4% to 50%, Similarly the resistance of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem decreased respectively from 61% to 39.4% and from 63.3% to 37.1%. Nevertheless, the reduction of resistance was followed by a rapid increasing during the year 2009 to reach overall rates of resistance previously observed in the hospital Aziza Othmana. Concerning S. aureus, the rate of MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) showed no significant variation throughout the study period: 60% versus 56.3% at HAO and CTGB. A. baumannii brings up the problem of mutiresistance: 92.7% of strains were resistant to ceftazidime and 63.9% to imipenem during P1 with an emphasis on resistance to imipenem during P2 increased to 89.3%. CONCLUSION: Resistance is a problem in the intensive care burn unit. Preventive measures have to be taken.
TI  - Outcomes in UK patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia and the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: There is lack of contemporary outcome data on patients with hospital-acquired infections that cause bacteraemia. We determined the risk factors for 7-day mortality and investigated the hypothesis that, compared with central venous catheter (CVC)-associated bacteraemic infections, catheter-associated bacteraemic urinary tract infections (UTIs) were significantly associated with 7-day mortality. METHODS: From October 2007 to September 2008, demographical, clinical and microbiological data were collected on patients with hospital-acquired bacteraemia. Patients were followed until death, hospital discharge or recovery from infection. Risk factors for 7-day mortality were determined and multivariate logistic regression was used to define the association between catheter-associated bacteraemic UTIs and likelihood of death. RESULTS: 559 bacteraemic episodes occurred in 437 patients. Overall, there were 90 deaths (20.6%) at 7 days and 153 deaths (35.0%) at 30 days. Among patients with catheter-associated bacteraemic UTIs, 7-day and 30-day mortalities associated with each bacteraemic episode were 25/83 (30.1%) and 33/83 (39.8%), respectively. Within this subgroup, the commonest isolates were Escherichia coli, 36 (43.4%), Proteus mirabilis, 11 (13.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9 (10.8%). There were 22 (26.5%) multiple drug-resistant isolates and, of the E coli infections, 6 (16.7%) were extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers. In univariate analysis, the variables found to have the strongest association with 7-day mortality were age, Pitt score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), medical speciality and site of infection. Compared with CVC-associated bacteraemic infections, there was a significant association between catheter-associated bacteraemic UTIs and 7-day mortality (OR 4.16, 95% CI 1.86 to 9.33). After adjustment for age and CCI, this association remained significant (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.19 to 7.07). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CVC-associated bacteraemic infections, catheter-associated bacteraemic UTIs were significantly associated with 7-day mortality. Efforts to reduce these infections should be prioritised.
TI  - Carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important Gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in Taiwan: results from the Surveillance of Multicentre Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART) in 2009.
AB  - To investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in Taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and Burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. Susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by the CLSI as well as 2012 MIC breakpoints recommended by EUCAST. Based on CLSI 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, respectively. All Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii isolates were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of P. mirabilis and all M. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. Meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae with ertapenem MICs>/=4 mg/L were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. Imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, respectively. Additionally, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=8 mg/L were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. These data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae as well as P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates with imipenem MICs>/=4 mg/L.
TI  - Aetiology and antibiotic resistance patterns of urinary tract infections in the elderly: a 6-month study.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common cause of bacteraemia in the elderly  and are associated with a high probability of hospitalization. Despite the impact of UTIs on health status and quality of life, a limited number of studies have evaluated their aetiology in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the microbial aetiology and pattern of susceptibility of bacteria causing UTIs in the elderly. For this purpose, a retrospective cohort study of elderly residents (n = 472, aged >65 years) in 14 nursing homes in Milan (Italy) and its province was performed. Globally, 393 micro-organisms from 328 samples were isolated: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent (44.8 %), followed by Proteus mirabilis (20.4 %), Providencia spp. (8.9 %), Klebsiella spp. (6.4 %) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.6 %). Enterococci were the most frequently isolated Gram-positive organisms (7.4 %). Almost all Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, carbapenems and amikacin. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 42.1 % of isolates. The most active antibiotics against P. aeruginosa were colistin, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. All Gram-positive organisms were susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid, and 90 % were susceptible to nitrofurantoin. Fluoroquinolones showed a limited activity against all the tested micro-organisms. Escherichia coli remains the major micro-organism responsible for UTIs in older people, although to a lesser extent than in a younger population. The high rates of resistance observed in this study make careful use of antibiotics advisable to limit further development of resistance.
TI  - Effects of different substituents on the crystal structures and antimicrobial activities of six Ag(I) quinoline compounds.
AB  - The syntheses and single crystal X-ray structures of [Ag(5-nitroquinoline)2]NO3 (1), [Ag(8-nitroquinoline)2]NO3.H2O (2), [Ag(6-methoxy-8-nitroquinoline)(NO3)]n (3), [Ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)(NO3)]n (4), [Ag(3-quinolinecarbonitrile)2]NO3 (5), and [Ag(6-quinolinecarboxylic acid)2]NO3 (6) are described. As an alternative to solution chemistry, solid-state grinding could be used to prepare compounds 1 and 3, but the preparation of 4 and 5 in this way failed. The Ag(I) ions in the monomeric compounds 1, 2, 5, and 6 are coordinated to two ligands via the nitrogen atoms of the quinoline rings, thereby forming a distorted linear coordination geometry with Ag-N bond distances of 2.142(2)-2.336(2) A and N-Ag-N bond angles of 163.62(13) degrees -172.25(13) degrees . The 1D coordination polymers 3 and 4 contain Ag(I) centers coordinating one ligand and two bridging nitrate groups, thereby forming a distorted trigonal planar coordination geometry with Ag-N bond distances of 2.2700(14) and 2.224(5) A, Ag-O bond distances of 2.261(4)-2.536(5) A, and N-Ag-O bond angles of 115.23(5) degrees -155.56(5) degrees . Hirshfeld surface analyses of compounds 1-6 are presented as d(norm) and curvedness maps. The d(norm) maps show different interaction sites around the Ag(I) ions, i.e., Ag...Ag interactions and possible O-H...O, C-H...O, C-H...N, and C-H...C hydrogen bonds. Curvedness maps are a good way of visualizing pi-pi stacking interactions between molecules. The antimicrobial activities of compounds 1, 2, and 6 were screened against 15 different multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria isolated from diabetic foot ulcers and compared to the antimicrobial activities of the clinically used silver sulfadiazine (SS). Compound 2 showed activity similar to SS against this set of test organisms, being active against all strains and having slightly better average silver efficiency than SS (5 vs 6 mug Ag/mL). Against the standard nonresistant bacterial strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Proteus mirabilis , and Streptococcus pyogenes , compound 1 performed better than silver nitrate, with an average MIC of 6 mug Ag/mL versus 18 mug Ag/mL for the reference AgNO3. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses of compounds 3 and 6 in DMSO/MeOH confirm the two-coordinated Ag(+) complexes in solution, and the results of the (1)H NMR titrations of DMSO solutions of 5-nitroquinoline and 8-nitroquinoline with AgNO3 in DMSO suggest that 5-nitroquinoline is more strongly coordinated to the silver ion.
TI  - Study of photodynamic therapy in the control of isolated microorganisms from infected wounds--an in vitro study.
AB  - The effective treatment of infected wounds continues to be a serious challenge, mainly due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) refers to the topical or systemic administration of a non-toxic, photosensitizing agent (PS), followed by irradiation with visible light of a suitable wavelength. The possibility of applying the PDT locally is what makes it so favorable to the treatment of infected wounds. The goal of this study was to evaluate the action of the PDT in the inactivation in vitro of microorganisms coming from infected wounds, using methylene blue (MB) and photodithazine (PDZ) as the PS and comparing the efficacy of these two compounds for PDT on bacteria. For the application of PDT, isolated microorganisms identified from material collected from wounds were suspended in a saline solution containing 10(6) viable cells/ml. Each isolated microorganism was submitted to PDT with MB and with PDZ in accordance with the following treatment groups: N/T--no treatment; T1--PDT with PDZ; T2--PDT with MB; T3--irradiation without PS; T4--treatment with PDZ without light; and T5--treatment with MB without light. As a light source, an LED-based device was used (Biopdi/Irrad-Lead 660), composed of 54 LEDs, each with 70 mW of power in the 660 nm region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each tray of 96 wells was irradiated with an intensity of 25 mW/cm(2) and a dose of light of 50 J/cm(3) for 33 min. All the tests were made in duplicate. It was then concluded that the PDT with PDZ was capable of inhibiting the growth of gram-positive bacteria samples, however it did not have the same effect on gram-negative bacteria, which showed growth greater than 100,000 CFU; the PDT with MB showed an effectiveness on gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria, for it was able to inhibit bacterial growth in both cases.
TI  - Urinary tract infection among symptomatic outpatients visiting a tertiary hospital based in midwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Microbial pathogens implicated in urinary tract infection and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns as prevalent in UTI symptomatic outpatients resident in Benin City, Nigeria was the focus of this study. One hundred (100) midstream urine samples were collected into sterile plastic universal bottles from outpatients who visited the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria and who were tentatively diagnosed as manifesting symptoms of UTI. Patients were referred to the Medical Microbiology department by the consulting doctors. Significant bacterial counts and neutrophil (pus cells) counts were carried out on samples by standard methods. Positive samples for both counts were inoculated aseptically on sterile MacConkey agar, Cystine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient (CLED) agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar plates and incubated appropriately. Microbial isolates were identified and antibiotic sensitivity testing was carried out on isolates by standard methods. Thirty nine (39.0%) and 61 (61.0%) samples recorded significant microbial growth and no growth respectively. Gram negative bacilli constituted 86.1% (of which enterobacteriaceae made up 49.9%) while gram positive cocci made up 13.9%. Strains of uropathogens isolated were Alcaligenes spp (19.4%), Klebsiella aerogenes (16.7%), Escherichia coli (13.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.9%), Candida albicans (11.1%), Proteus mirabilis (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.5%), Enterobacter spp (5.5%) and Providencia spp (5.5%). Occurrence of UTI in male and female patients were 58.3% and 41.7% respectively of which UTI occurred highest in the 25-46, 15-54 and 27-54 age groups in that decreasing order. Alcaligenes spp occurred most in very old female patients. Candida albicans (the only fungal uropathogen) occurred in an 8day old male patient. Other isolates occurred in much older patients. A significantly high microscopic neutrophil count or pyuria was recorded from deposits of UTI positive patients (i.e. &lt; 5/HPF). Eighteen (representing 50.5%) and 15 (47.8%) of total microbial strains isolated were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and ceftriaxone respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility profile also showed 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%), 13(41.6%) for ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and ofloxacin respectively suggesting moderate sensitivity of the fluoroquinolones and second/third generation cephalosporins. Gentamicin, ampicillin and augmentin recorded over 70.0% resistance level each. A total of nineteen bacterial strains made of E.coli, Enterobacter spp, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp, Staph. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were multi drug resistant as they resisted 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 and 8 antibiotics respectively.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from infected wounds and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern: some remarks about wound infection.
AB  - Wound infection plays an important role in the development of chronicity, delaying wound healing. This study aimed to identify the bacterial pathogens present in infected wounds and characterise their resistance profile to the most common antibiotics used in therapy. Three hundred and twelve wound swab samples were collected from 213 patients and analysed for the identification of microorganisms and for the determination of their antibiotic susceptibility. Patients with diverse type of wounds were included in this retrospective study, carried out from March to September 2012. A total of 28 species were isolated from 217 infected wounds. The most common bacterial species detected was Staphylococcus aureus (37%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17%), Proteus mirabilis (10%), Escherichia coli (6%) and Corynebacterium spp. (5%). Polymicrobial infection was found in 59 (27.1%) of the samples and was mainly constituted with two species. The most common association was S. aureus/P. aeruginosa. All Gram-positives were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. Gram-negatives showed quite high resistance to the majority of antibiotics, being amikacin the most active against these bacteria. This study is mostly oriented to health care practitioners who deal with wound management, making them aware about the importance of wound infection and helping them to choose the adequate treatment options to control microbial infection in wounds.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance patterns of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: We characterize the current national patterns of antibiotic resistance of outpatient pediatric urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined outpatient urinary isolates from patients younger than 18 years in 2009 using The Surveillance Network(R), a database with antibiotic susceptibility results and patient demographic data from 195 United States hospitals. We determined the prevalence and antibiotic resistance patterns for the 6 most common uropathogens, ie Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus. We compared differences in uropathogen prevalence between males and females using chi-square analysis. RESULTS: We identified 25,418 outpatient urinary isolates. E. coli was the most common uropathogen overall but the prevalence of E. coli was higher among females (83%) than males (50%, p <0.001). Other common species among males were Enterococcus (17%), P. mirabilis (11%) and Klebsiella (10%). However, these uropathogens each accounted for 5% or less of female isolates (p <0.001). Resistance among E. coli was highest for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (24%) but lower for nitrofurantoin (less than 1%) and cephalothin (15%). Compared to 2002 Surveillance Network data, E. coli resistance rates increased for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (from 23% to 31% in males and from 20% to 23% in females) and ciprofloxacin (from 1% to 10% and from 0.6% to 4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli remains the most common pediatric uropathogen. Although widely used, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a poor empirical choice for pediatric urinary tract infections in many areas due to high resistance rates. First-generation cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin are appropriate narrow-spectrum alternatives given their low resistance rates. Local antibiograms should be used to assist with empirical urinary tract infection treatment.
TI  - FlgM proteins from different bacteria exhibit different structural characteristics.
AB  - Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a unique class of proteins that do not require a stable structure for function. The importance of IDPs in many biological processes has been established but there remain unanswered questions about their evolution and conservation of their disordered state within a protein family. Our group has been studying the structural similarities among orthologous FlgM proteins, a model class of IDPs. We have previously shown that the FlgM protein from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus has more structure at A. aeolicus' physiological temperature (85 degrees C) than is observed for the Salmonella typhimurium FlgM, suggesting that the disordered nature of FlgM varies among organisms and is not universally conserved. In this work, we extend these studies to the FlgM proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that the B. subtilis, E. coli, and S. typhimurium FlgMs exist in a premolten globule-like conformation, though the B. subtilis FlgM is in a more compacted conformation than the other two. The P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis FlgM proteins exist in a currently unknown conformation that is not either coil-like or premolten globule-like. The P. aeruginosa FlgM appears to contain more weak intramolecular contacts given its more compacted state than the P. mirabilis FlgM. These results provide experimental evidence that members of the same protein family can exhibit different degrees of disorder, though understanding how different disordered states evolve in the same protein family will require more study.
TI  - Microbial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile from hospitalized  patients in Central Alabama.
AB  - Urinary tract infections remain a common problem in inpatient care. They are highly challenging to provide effective initial therapy without sensitivity data. The purpose of this study was to survey the uropathogens and their sensitivity profile at a hospital in Central Alabama and to guide experiential antibiotic selection. This was the first reported study on bacterial uropathogens and their antibiotic resistance profile at this Central Alabama hospital. The survey period was between July 2009 and June 2010, a total of 473 urine cultures were reviewed and susceptibility testing was determined using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) microdilution method. The results indicated that Escherichia coli (45.5%) was the most common organism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.8%), Enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (3.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter freundii (1.5%), Morganella morganii (1.3%), and the other species (7.0%). For the 215 E. coli isolates, imipenem and cephalosporins (except for cefazolin) had the highest sensitivity (99-100%, P < 0.05). In contrast, ampicillin had the highest resistance (57%, P < 0.05) as compared to other antibiotics (about 30%) including ampicillin/ sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The major finding of this study was that ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole had comparable sensitivity patterns for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae, the most common uropathogens at this Central Alabama hospital. Additionally, this study found that E. coli had a resistant rate of 31% to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin compared to the resistance rate of 28.4% and 15.8% in earlier reports (Lee et al. 2010; Rattanaumpawan et al. 2010), likely indicating the continuing evolution of resistance due to antibiotic exposure. It is imperative to monitor the resistance of P. aeruginosa considering their high resistance to imipenem found in this study.
TI  - Persistence of bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa in non-healing venous ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that chronic inflammation due to bacterial wound colonization delays wound healing. OBJECTIVE: In this study, in a Leipzig (Germany) cohort of chronic wound patients, the microbiological spectrum in 2005 and in 2010 was evaluated, as were patients with continuous ulceration sequentially over a decade from 2001-2011. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the microbial swabs of 126 patients with chronic leg ulcers caused by chronic venous insufficiency. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis in both 2005 and 2010, as well as in the longitudinal analysis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis were respectively the most common pathogens colonizing chronic leg ulcers. In the longitudinal analysis from 2001-2011, the same bacterial species could be identified >/= 3 years consecutively in 20/35 patients. Normally only one or two species could persistently be demonstrated over the years. The subgroup of patients with >/= 3 x confirmation of P. aeruginosa in their swabs showed a longer wound duration compared to all patients in the longitudinal group. CONCLUSION: We registered the persistence of bacteria like P. aeruginosa or S. aureus in consecutive bacterial swabs over the years in individual patients with non-healing venous ulcerations.
TI  - Antimicrobial lectin from Schinus terebinthifolius leaf.
AB  - AIMS: Schinus terebinthifolius leaves are used for treating human diseases caused by micro-organisms. This work reports the isolation, characterization and antimicrobial activity of S. terebinthifolius leaf lectin (SteLL). METHODS AND RESULTS: The isolation procedure involved protein extraction with 0.15 mol l(-1) NaCl, filtration through activated charcoal and chromatography of the filtrate on a chitin column. SteLL is a 14-kDa glycopeptide with haemagglutinating activity that is inhibited by N-acetyl-glucosamine, not affected by ions (Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)) and stable upon heating (30-100 degrees C) as well as over the pH 5.0-8.0. The antimicrobial effect of SteLL was evaluated by determining the minimal inhibitory (MIC), bactericide (MBC) and fungicide (MFC) concentrations. Lectin was active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus. Highest bacteriostatic and bactericide effects were detected for Salm. enteritidis (MIC: 0.45 mug ml(-1)) and Staph. aureus (MBC: 7.18 mug ml(-1)), respectively. SteLL impaired the growth (MIC: 6.5 mug ml(-1)) and survival (MFC: 26 mug ml(-1)) of Candida albicans. CONCLUSIONS: SteLL, a chitin-binding lectin, purified in milligram quantities, showed antimicrobial activity against medically important bacteria and fungi. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: SteLL can be considered as a new biomaterial for potential antimicrobial applications.
TI  - The effect of copper(II), iron(II) sulphate, and vitamin C combinations on the weak antimicrobial activity of (+)-catechin against Staphylococcus aureus and other microbes.
AB  - Few attempts have been made to improve the activity of plant compounds with low antimicrobial efficacy. (+)-Catechin, a weak antimicrobial tea flavanol, was combined with putative adjuncts and tested against different species of bacteria. Copper(II) sulphate enhanced (+)-catechin activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis or Escherichia coli. Attempts to raise the activity of (+)-catechin against two unresponsive species, S. aureus and E. coli, with iron(II) sulphate, iron(III) chloride, and vitamin C, showed that iron(II) enhanced (+)-catechin against S. aureus, but not E. coli; neither iron(III) nor combined iron(II) and copper(II), enhanced (+)-catechin activity against either species. Vitamin C enhanced copper(II) containing combinations against both species in the absence of iron(II). Catalase or EDTA added to active samples removed viability effects suggesting that active mixtures had produced H(2)O(2)via the action of added metal(II) ions. H(2)O(2) generation by (+)-catechin plus copper(II) mixtures and copper(II) alone could account for the principal effect of bacterial growth inhibition following 30 minute exposures as well as the antimicrobial effect of (+)-catechin-iron(II) against S. aureus. These novel findings about a weak antimicrobial flavanol contrast with previous knowledge of more active flavanols with transition metal combinations. Weak antimicrobial compounds like (+)-catechin within enhancement mixtures may therefore be used as efficacious agents. (+)-Catechin may provide a means of lowering copper(II) or iron(II) contents in certain crop protection and other products.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of Dendrophthoe falcata against different bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata is a hemiparasitic plant commonly used for ailments such as  ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, menstrual troubles, pulmonary tuberculosis, and wounds. In this context, the validations of the traditional claim that the leaf extract of D. falcata possesses antibiofilm and anti-quorum sensing activity against different bacterial pathogens were assessed. The bacterial biofilms were quantified by crystal violet staining. Among the 17 bacterial pathogens screened, the methanolic fraction of the leaf extract clearly demonstrated antibiofilm activity for Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Shigella sonnei, Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio cholerae, and Proteus vulgaris. At biofilm inhibitory concentrations, biofilm formation was reduced by up to 70-90 %. Furthermore, the potential quorum-sensing activity of the leaf extract was tested by agar well diffusion using Chromobacterium violaceum (ATCC 12472 & CV O26) reporter strains. The inhibition of violacein production may be due to direct or indirect interference on QS by active constituents or the interactive effect of different phytocompounds present in the extracts. This is the first report on antibiofilm and QS activity of D. falcata leaf extracts, signifying the scope for development of complementary medicine for biofilm-associated infections.
TI  - Isolation of pathogenic bacteria from fomites in the operating rooms of a specialist hospital in Kano, North-western Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infection constitute over 25% of infection rates in the hospital setting causing significant morbidity and mortality especially in developing countries. The aim of this study is to establish the possible presence of known bacteria pathogens on fomites in the operating theatre and evaluate their antibiotic susceptibility pattern. METHODS: Various items in the operating theatre rooms such as forceps, scissors, floor, walls, suction tube, sink, theatre bed covers etc. were screened for the presence of bacterial and fungal pathogens from Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, Kano between Jan - Aug 2009. One thousand eight hundred (1,800) samples were processed. Bacterial and fungal isolates were identified by standard microbiological procedures. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of eight bacteria genera and four fungal species were observed. The following bacterial pathogens were isolated; Escherichia coli (10.0%), Proteus Mirabilis (8.33%), Proteus vulgaris (6.70%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.83%), Streptococcus spp. (18.3%), E. faecalis (3.33%), Coagulase negative staph (28.3%) and Salmonella choleraesius (0.83%). Ofloxacin and ceftriaxone showed encouraging results against the isolates. CONCLUSION: Fomites should be regarded as a possible source of nosocomial infection since bacteria from them can be carried from the hands of theatre personnel to the patient undergoing surgery or through redispersed bacteria from surfaces during surgery.
TI  - Discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared Raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  - ABSTRACT. A method, based on Raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed. Spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (Gram-negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, and Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a Raman spectrometer with a fiber Raman probe (830 nm). Colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for Raman measurements. After preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance (PCA/MD) discrimination algorithm. We found that the mean Raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and S. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. PCA/MD could discriminate Gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and Gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones among gram positive and gram negative clinical isolates.
AB  - Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are considered as first line drugs to treat infectious diseases. In order to find out useful fluoroquinolones, the antibiotic resistance of fluoroquinolones, namely, ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NRF), enoxacin (ENX), pefloxacin (PFL) and levofloxacin (LVF) was investigated against ninety five clinical isolates that includes Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. In vitro activity of these isolates was carried out by agar dilution method. All Staphylococcus aureus were sensitive to OFL at 2 mug/ml. About 6% isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were found to be resistance to LVF and ENX, 6% to CIP, OFL and PFL and none of the isolates were resistant to LVF and ENX. Percentage resistance of P. aeruginosa was found to be 4.35% to CIP, 7% to OFL and 2.2% to NRF, whereas 8.69% to ENX, 0% to PFL and 17.4% to LVF, respectively. The present study provides the data about the emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones among gram positive and gram negative bacteria and strongly recommends the rational and appropriate use of these antibiotics.
TI  - Membrane interaction and secondary structure of de novo designed arginine-and tryptophan peptides with dual function.
AB  - Cell-penetrating peptides and antimicrobial peptides are two classes of positively charged membrane active peptides with several properties in common. The challenge is to combine knowledge about the membrane interaction mechanisms and structural properties of the two classes to design peptides with membrane-specific actions, useful either as transporters of cargo or as antibacterial substances. Membrane active peptides are commonly rich in arginine and tryptophan. We have previously designed a series of arg/trp peptides and investigated how the position and number of tryptophans affect cellular uptake. Here we explore the antimicrobial properties and the interaction with lipid model membranes of these peptides, using minimal inhibitory concentrations assay (MIC), circular dichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD). The results show that the arg/trp peptides inhibit the growth of the two gram positive strains Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pyogenes, with some individual variations depending on the position of the tryptophans. No inhibition of the gram negative strains Proteus mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa was noticed. CD indicated that when bound to lipid vesicles one of the peptides forms an alpha-helical like structure, whereas the other five exhibited rather random coiled structures. LD indicated that all six peptides were somehow aligned parallel with the membrane surface. Our results do not reveal any obvious connection between membrane interaction and antimicrobial effect for the studied peptides. By contrast cell-penetrating properties can be coupled to both the secondary structure and the degree of order of the peptides.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - The effect of plum juice on the prevention of struvite calculus formation in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of plum juice on struvite calculus formation in vitro and to explore the effect of plum juice on urease-producing bacteria and urease activity. The compliance of available drugs is low for struvite calculus after surgical treatment and functional food may represent a good choice as an alternative therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activity was assessed using a microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test. Urease activity was determined by measuring ammonia production. Struvite crystals were induced by Proteus mirabilis in artificial urine with natural and pH-adjusted plum juice. The optical density (OD)(600) and pH of artificial urine were examined, as well the shape and weights of crystals. RESULTS: Natural plum juice showed an antibacterial effect on urease-producing bacteria, whereas the pH-adjusted juice did not. A concentration-dependent inhibition on urease activity was found for both natural and pH-adjusted juice. Natural plum juice at a high concentration of 0.5% showed an obvious inhibition on the increase of OD(600) and pH of the artificial urine, and crystal formation was prevented by up to or more than 8 h, depending on the concentration of juice. Crystal weight in the natural plum juice groups was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The pH-adjusted plum juice did not show any effect on OD(600) and pH, although the presence of juice changed the crystal habit, indicating that the juice slowed the growth rate of crystals. CONCLUSIONS: Natural plum juice at high and moderate concentrations prevented the formation of P. mirabilis-induced crystals for up to 8 h in artificial urine. Although pH-adjusted and low-concentration natural juice did not prevent the occurrence of crystals, both types of juice slowed their growth rate.
TI  - Gram-negative bacterial infection in thigh abscess can migrate to distant burn depending on burn depth.
AB  - Sepsis remains the major cause of death in patients with major burn injuries. In  the present investigation we evaluated the interaction between burn injuries of varying severity and preexisting distant infection. We used Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis) that were genetically engineered to be bioluminescent, which allowed for noninvasive, sequential optical imaging of the extent and severity of the infection. The bioluminescent bacteria migrated from subcutaneous abscesses in the leg to distant burn wounds on the back depending on the severity of the burn injury, and this migration led to increased mortality of the mice. Treatment with ciprofloxacin, injected either in the leg with the bacterial infection or into the burn eschar, prevented this colonization of the wound and decreased mortality. The present data suggest that burn wounds can readily become colonized by infections distant from the wound itself.
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bioactive compounds and leaf extracts in Jatropha tanjorensis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Jatropha tanjorensis was investigated scientifically to generate evidence for the efficacies reported in traditional systems and the results are given here. METHODS: Different concentrations of the solvent extracts of leaves and four isolated compounds were tested against human pathogenic microorganisms such as gram-positive bacteria of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, gram-negative bacteria of Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Vibrio alcaligenes, Vibrio cholerae and fungi of Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton rubrum by agar-well diffusion and disk diffusion methods. RESULTS: In agar-well diffusion method, maximum activity was recorded in a concentration-dependent manner. The extracts recorded activity against bacteria such as 17-26, 15-25 and 13-24 mm to methanol extract and 15-24, 14-23 and 12-22 mm to chloroform extract at 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/ml respectively and fungi such as 9-15 mm to A. fumigatus and 5-16 mm to T. rubrum. Maximum activity was 30-46, 27-43 and 17-40 mm to friedelin and 23-46, 28-44 and 18-41 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against bacteria and 12-37, 8-34 and 31-33 mm to friedelin and 12-40, 11-35 and 10-33 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against fungi at 10, 5 and 2.5mg respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concludes that friedelin, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone present in the methanol extract could be responsible for the broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and provide scientific evidence.
TI  - [Bacteriological profile of chronic otitis media in the ENT and neck surgery department at the Ouagadougou University Hospital Center (Burkina Faso)].
AB  - The specific germs that cause chronic otitis media determine the treatment necessary. The purpose of this study was to identify the pathogens involved in this disease and to determine the sensitivity of the antibiotics commonly used in order to improve treatment. METHODS: This prospective study took place over 12 months and recorded 53 cases of chronic otorrhea in the ENT department of Ouagadougou University Hospital: 41 underwent cytologic and bacteriologic analysis. RESULTS: We identified 34 cases of bacterial infection (83%), 2 cases of fungal infection (5%) and 5 sterile cultures (12%). The bacteria isolated most frequently were Staphylococcus aureus (29%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26%) and Proteus mirabilis (18%). These organisms were most sensitive to fluoroquinolones (84%) and third-generation cephalosporins (77%). However, amoxicillin and tetracycline were fairly active against these pathogens, with sensitivity rates of respectively 19% and 7%. CONCLUSION: These data could help guide regional practitioners in choosing probabilistic antibiotic treatment. Sensitivity testing nonetheless remains needed in chronic otorrhea, to verify the efficacy of initial treatment and guide adequate care.
TI  - Incidence and risk factors for infection in oral cancer patients undergoing different treatments protocols.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in cancer treatments have been counterbalanced by a rising number of immunosuppressed patients with a multitude of new risk factors for infection. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine risk factors, infectious pathogens in blood and oral cavity of oral cancer patients undergoing different treatment procedures. METHODS: The present prospective cohort analysis was conducted on the patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, during the period of January 2007 to October 2009. Total 186 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity were analyzed in the study. Based on treatment procedures patients were divided into three groups, group I were under radiotherapy, group II under chemotherapy and group III were of radio chemotherapy together. Clinical isolates from blood and oral cavity were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus. The predominant gram negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia were isolated from blood of radiotherapy and oral cavity of chemotherapy treated cases respectively. The predominance of gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were observed in blood of chemotherapy, radio chemotherapy cases and oral cavity of radiotherapy, radio chemotherapy treated cases. Our study also revealed the presence of C. albicans fungi as most significant oral cavity pathogens in radiotherapy and radio chemotherapy cases. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative were reported from the blood of all the three groups of patients. Oral mucositis played a significant role in oral cavity infection and make patients more prone to C. albicans infection.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibilityof clinical isolates of aerobic gram-negative bacteria in 2008].
AB  - We determined MICs of antibacterial agents against 1145 clinical strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (22 species) isolated at 16 Japanese facilities in 2008. MICs were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) accounted for 3.8% of Escherichia coli, 2.6% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6.8% of Klebsiella oxytoca, 5.5% of Proteus mirabilis and 1.8% of Proteus vulgaris. ESBL produced strains were 6.8% at K. oxytoca that increased compared with 3.2% and 5.5% at P. mirabilis that decreased compared with 18.8% in 2006. Among Haemophilus influenzae, 61.7% that decreased compared with 67.7% in 2006, equaled 58.7% in 2004, were strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006. Although two antibacterial agents that tobramycin showed an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL and doripenem showed an MIC90 of 4 microg/mL against P. aeruginosa have potent activity. Of all P. aeruginosa strains, 4.3% were resistant to six agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, that decreased compared to 12.2% in 2004 and 5.7% in 2006. Against other glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative rods, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2006.
TI  - Spectrum and drug resistance of pathogens from patients with burns.
AB  - Microbial infection is an obstacle of burn treatment. However, little is known on what types of microbial infection dominate in the burn center and how the dynamic change of those microorganisms occurs during the past several years in China. We conducted a retrospective study of nosocomial infection (NI) in a large burn center to analyze the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of microbial isolates from January 2003 to December 2010. We studied 989 isolates from 677 patients who had signs and symptoms of infection 48h after admission. The number of NIs per 100 admissions was 10.9. The commonest isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), and Candida (11.4%). The result indicated that the numbers of patients with Acinetobacter sp. infection increased (P=0.004), but with Proteus mirabilis infection decreased (P=0.004). The isolated Acinetobacter sp. and P. aeruginosa were consistently highly resistant to almost all antibiotics tested. Notably, more frequent Acinetobacter sp. isolates appeared to be resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ceftazidim, piperacillin, tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin and more frequent Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam at the late time period although the P. aeruginosa and E. coli isolates were sensitive to less used ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The increased rates of drug-resistant isolates in the later period might be associated with regular prophylactic therapy with antibiotics.
TI  - Type I and Type II mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (PS) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen ((1) O(2), produced via Type II mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (HO(.), produced via Type I mechanism). This study examined the relative contributions of (1) O(2) and HO(.) to APDT killing of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (HPF) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (SOSG) were used to determine HO(.) and (1) O(2) produced by illumination of two PS: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (BB6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (PEI-ce6). Dimethylthiourea is a HO(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (NaN(3)) is a quencher of (1) O(2). Both APDT and killing by Fenton reaction (chemical generation of HO(.)) were carried out on Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: Conjugate PEI-ce6 mainly produced (1) O(2) (quenched by NaN(3)), while BB6 produced HO(.) in addition to (1) O(2) when NaN(3) potentiated probe activation. NaN(3) also potentiated HPF activation by Fenton reagent. All bacteria were killed by Fenton reagent but Gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than Gram-negatives. NaN(3) potentiated Fenton-mediated killing of all bacteria. The ratio of APDT killing between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for BB6 and 25:1 for conjugate PEI-ce6. There was a NaN(3) dose-dependent inhibition of APDT killing using both PEI-ce6 and BB6 against Gram-negative bacteria while NaN(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Azidyl radicals may be formed from NaN(3) and HO(.). It may be that Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to HO(.) while Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) O(2). The differences in NaN(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of PS binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of NaN(3) into cell walls of bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary infections in Taiwan: results from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), 2006-2010.
AB  - We investigated the trends in antimicrobial resistance among species of Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections in Taiwan during the period 2006-2010 as part of the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART). During the study period, 1032 isolates of Gram-negative bacilli that had been collected from patients with hepatobiliary infections were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (n = 874, 84.7%) of isolates and Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (n = 323, 31.3%). There were significantly more E. coli (P = 0.001) and Proteus mirabilis (P = 0.031) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for less than 48 h and significantly more Serratia marcescens (P = 0.035) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.008) isolates collected from patients who had been hospitalized for 48 h or longer. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens was low. The decline in susceptibility rates with time was remarkable for ceftazidime (P = 0.036), ciprofloxacin (P = 0.029), and levofloxacin (P = 0.018). The most effective antibiotics, i.e., those that were active against more than 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, were amikacin, cefepime, imipenem, ertapenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to anti-pseudomonal agents was greater than 80%. In this study, we found an overall increase in resistance to antimicrobial agents among Gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with hepatobiliary tract infections in Taiwan. Surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility and updates of treatment guidelines are recommended to help achieve optimal therapy for patients with hepatobiliary infections.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of flavonoids of withania somnifera L.
AB  - In the present study antimicrobial activity of Withania somnifera L. Dunal (Solanaceae) has been evaluated against selected pathogens. Free and bound flavonoids of different parts (root, stem, leaf and fruit) of W. somnifera have been studied for their antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion assay against three Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli MTCC 46, Proteus mirabilis MTCC 3310 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 1934), one Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 3160) and three fungi (Candida albicans MTCC 183, Aspergillus flavus MTCC 277 and Aspergillus niger MTCC 282). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts was evaluated through micro broth dilution method, while minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration was determined by sub culturing the relevant samples. C. albicans was found to be the most susceptible organism followed by S. aureus, P. mirabilis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Out of the tested organisms, A flavus and A. niger were observed to be resistant as none of the tested extracts showed activity against them. Total activity (TA) of extracts (ml/g) against each sensitive pathogens was also evaluated. Bound flavonoid extract of root showed best activity against C. albicans (IZ 30, MIC 0.039, MFC 0.039, respectively). However all the microorganisms were found to be sensitive against the extracts tested. Total activity of bound flavonoid extract of root was found to be same for E.coli, P. mirabilis, S. aureus and C. albicans (153.84 ml/g). Results of the present study reveal that extracts of W. somnifera showing great antimicrobial potential against test microorganisms may be exploited for future antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - [Urinary tract nosocomial infections at the Clinical Centre in Kragujevac].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections are the most frequent hospital infections  and account for about 40% of total hospital infections. The main risk factor for their development is the use of catheters. OBJECTIVE: Assessment of basic epidemiological and etiological characteristics of nosocomial urinary tract infections (NUTIs) and investigation of differences in risk factors among the patients with NUTIs with and without the urinary catheter. METHODS: The study comprised patients treated in chosen units/ of the Clinical Center in Kragujevac, in whom NUTI was registered during 2009. Differences in risk factors for NUTIs between the catheterized and uncatheterized patients were tested by the logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: NUTIs was registered in 162 patients whose average age was 66.2 +/- 13.5 years with approximately equal gender participation (51.2% men and 48.8% women). Almost three quarters of the patients with NUITs had indwelling urinary catheter, 12.0 +/- 7.7 days on average (from 1 to 39 days). In the patients with urinary catheter, the risk for NUITs was significantly positively associated with emergency admission to hospital treatment (p=0.0185). The uncatheterized patients had a significant frequency of malignant tumours comparing to the patients with a urinary catheter (p=0.039). The compared groups did not differ in other risk factors. The most frequently isolated microbial agents was Klebsiella spp (37.3%), then Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.1%) and Proteus mirabilis (11.9%). Most of the bacteria showed a great level of resistance to frequently used antibacterial drugs, even up to 100%. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to define national recommendations for the prevention and control of NUTIs in the future.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and antibiotics.
AB  - Synergistic activity of Salvia officinalis and Cichorium intybus extracts and commonly used antibiotics, amoxicillin and chloramphenicol, were evaluated. Interactions between plant extracts and antibiotics were tested by checkerboard method and interpreted as FIC index. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and clinical isolates Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were used. Salvia officinalis showed better synergistic capacity than Cichorium intybus. Synergistic interactions were observed between amoxicillin and acetone or ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis and between chloramphenicol and ethyl acetate extract of Salvia officinalis. In the presence of sub-inhibitory concentration (1/4 MIC to 1/32 MIC) of sage extracts, the MIC values of antibiotics were decreased by 2- to 10-fold. Synergism was observed against all test bacteria, except Escherichia coli. The combinations of acetone and ethyl acetate extract from Cichorium intybus and antibiotics resulted in additive and indifferent effects against tested bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of the binding specificity of two bacterial metalloproteases, LasB of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ZapA of Proteus mirabilis, using N-alpha mercaptoamide template-based inhibitor analogues.
AB  - The metalloproteases ZapA of Proteus mirabilis and LasB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to be virulence factors their respective opportunistic bacterial pathogens, and are members of the structurally related serralysin and thermolysin families of bacterial metalloproteases respectively. Secreted at the site of infection, these proteases play a key role in the infection process, contributing to tissue destruction and processing of components of the host immune system. Inhibition of these virulence factors may therefore represent an antimicrobial strategy, attenuating the virulence of the infecting pathogen. Previously we have screened a library of N-alpha mercaptoamide dipeptide inhibitors against both ZapA and LasB, with the aim of mapping the S1' binding site of the enzymes, revealing both striking similarities and important differences in their binding preferences. Here we report the design, synthesis, and screening of several inhibitor analogues, based on two parent inhibitors from the original library. The results have allowed for further characterization of the ZapA and LasB active site binding pockets, and have highlighted the possibility for development of broad-spectrum bacterial protease inhibitors, effective against enzymes of the thermolysin and serralysin metalloprotease families.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of major uropathogens in a single-pot multiplex PCR assay.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common bacterial infections and poses a significant healthcare burden. Escherichia coli is the most common cause of UTI accounting for up to 70 % and a variable contribution from Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. To establish a complete diagnostic system, we have developed a single-tube multiplex PCR assay (mPCR) for the detection of the above-mentioned four major uropathogens. The sensitivity of the assay was found to be as low as 10(2) cfu/ml of cells. The mPCR evaluated on 280 clinical isolates detected 100 % of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis and 95 % of K. pneumonia. The assay was performed on 50 urine samples and found to be specific and sensitive for clinical diagnosis. In addition, the mPCR was also validated on spiked urine samples using 40 clinical isolates to demonstrate its application under different strain used in this assay. In total, mPCR reported here is a rapid and simple screening tool that can compete with conventional biochemical-based screening assays that may require 2-3 days for detection.
TI  - Globally dispersed mobile drug-resistance genes in gram-negative bacterial isolates from patients with bloodstream infections in a US urban general hospital.
AB  - Mobile drug-resistance genes with identical nucleic acid sequences carried by multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strains that cause community-acquired infections are becomingly increasingly dispersed worldwide. Over a 2-year period, we analysed gram-negative bacterial (GNB) pathogens from the blood of inpatients at an urban public hospital to determine what proportion of these isolates carried such globally dispersed drug-resistance genes. Of 376 GNB isolates, 167 (44 %) were Escherichia coli, 50 (13 %) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 25 (7 %) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 25 (7 %) were Proteus mirabilis and 20 (5 %) were Enterobacter cloacae; the remainder (24 %) comprised 26 different GNB species. Among E. coli isolates, class 1 integrons were detected in 64 (38 %). The most common integron gene cassette configuration was dfrA17-aadA5, found in 30 (25 %) of 119 drug-resistant E. coli isolates and in one isolate of Moraxella morganii. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes were found in 16 E. coli isolates (10 %). These genes with identical sequences were found in nearly 40 % of bloodstream E. coli isolates in the study hospital, as well as in a variety of bacterial species from clinical and non-clinical sources worldwide. Thus, a substantial proportion of bloodstream infections among hospitalized patients were caused by E. coli strains carrying drug-resistance genes that are dispersed globally in a wide variety of bacterial species.
TI  - Microbiological and mucociliary properties of the ethanol extract of Hymenocardia acida on selected respiratory clinical isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial property of the ethanol leaf extract of Hymenocardia acida (H.  acida) on some opportunistic respiratory pathogens was evaluated in this study. We also assessed the activity of the extract on tracheal mucociliary activity using murine tracheal mucus exudation and mucociliary motility in pigeons as experimental models. Phytochemical screening of the extract was done; and acute toxicity of the extract in mice was carried out using Lorke's method for estimation of its median lethal dose. Results show the presence of carbohydrates, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, resins, and balsams in the extract and the absence of anthraquinones, terpenes, and sterols. Results of the acute toxicity test showed that the extract was slightly toxic, with an estimated median lethal dose of 1,767.77 mg/kg body weight. At 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight of H. acida, tracheal mucus exudation was increased by 14.29, 19.24, and 33.82%, respectively. The effect on mucociliary velocity was dose-dependent as 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight of the extract led to increased ciliary activity by 7.69, 61.5, and 81.6%, respectively. The effects of the extract (200 mg/kg body weight) on mucus exudation and clearance were significant (p < .05) and higher than the effect of ammonium chloride. Although the extract did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans and K. pneumoniae, it exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. These findings show the mucociliary activity and antimicrobial properties of H. acida ethanol extract, and justify its use in the treatment of airway disorders.
TI  - Semisynthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel guttiferone-A derivatives.
AB  - Six derivatives of guttiferone-A (LFQM-79, 80, 81, 82, 113 and 114) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic or pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 09548), Candida glabrata (ATCC 90030), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 69548), Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012), Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum gypseum and also against the opportunistic and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 25933). The antimicrobial activities of derivatives were compared with guttiferone-A and they presented to be more potent than the original molecule and sometimes greater than standard drugs established in therapeutics. The current study showed that derivatives of guttiferone-A possess potent antimicrobial activity and are relatively non-cytotoxic, which reveal these new molecules as promising new drug prototype candidates, with innovative structural pattern.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Terminalia arjuna Wight & Arn.: an ethnomedicinal plant against pathogens causing ear infection.
AB  - Ear infection is one of the common diseases occurring throughout the world. Different etiological agents are responsible for ear infections. AIM: To assess the antimicrobial potential of Terminalia arjuna leaves and bark extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Escherchia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, pathogens causing ear infections and their comparison with locally available ear drops. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanol, ethanol, acetone, aqueous (hot and cold) extracts from the leaves and bark of T. arjuna were tested for their antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: Of the three organic solvents evaluated, acetonic leaf extract was found to be best against S. aureus. Organic bark extract showed almost equal inhibition of all tested Gram negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. However, aqueous extract of T. arjuna bark exhibited good activity against S. aureus. All the extracts were unable to exhibit any antifungal activity. CONCLUSION: Organic extract obtained from the T. arjuna bark and leaves may be used to treat the bacterial ear pathogens especially S. aureus, which has shown greater inhibition zones than the herbal drops, however, we still need more detailed studies as in vivo testing and pharmacokinetics properties for their therapeutic utility in treating ear infections.
TI  - Bacteriology of infected burn wounds in the burn wards of a teaching hospital in  Southwest Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burns are characterized by the loss of varying proportions of the protective layers of the skin, depression of immune responses, and increased wound susceptibility to infection. Wound infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in burn cases. This study characterizes those factors that predispose burn wounds to infection and the bacteriology of the microorganisms in our environment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective study of burns patients that were admitted and treated at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja-Lagos, Nigeria between January 1 and May 31, 2010 was carried out. Information about the demographics, aetiology/mechanism of burns, interval between the time of injury and admission, microbial studies, and antibiotic therapy were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients consisting of 43 males and 31 females were seen. The ages range between one week and 95 +/- 22.42 years. Wound infections were confirmed in 28 patients (infection rate of 37.84 per 100 patients). Delayed presentation at LASUTH and length of hospital stay were significantly related to the development of wound infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were the most common infective organisms occurring in 53.6 and 10.7 percentages respectively. The isolated organisms were resistant to the beta-lactam antibiotics and mostly sensitive to carbapenem and aztreonam preparations. CONCLUSION: Factors predisposing to invasive wound infections in our environment were highlighted and suggestions made on methods that could reduce the infections and thus reduce morbidity and mortality in burns.
TI  - Broad identification of bacterial type in urinary tract infection using (1)h NMR  spectroscopy.
AB  - To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the rapid identification of urinary tract infection (UTI), we applied (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a surrogate method for fast screening of microorganisms. Study includes 682 urine samples from suspected UTI patients, 50 healthy volunteers, and commercially available standard strains of gram negative bacilli (GNB) (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii) and gram positive cocci (GPC) (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B, Staphylococcus saprophyticus). Acetate, lactate, ethanol, succinate, creatinine, trimethylamine (TMA), citrate, trimethylamin-N-oxide, glycine, urea, and hippurate were measured by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. All urine specimens were evaluated with culture method. Multivariate discriminant function analysis (DFA) reveals that acetate, lactate, succinate, and formate were able to differentiate, with high accuracy (99.5%), healthy controls from UTI patients. This statistical analysis was also able to classify GNB to GPC infected urine samples with high accuracy (96%). This technique appears to be a promising, rapid, and noninvasive approach to probing GNB and GPC infected urine specimens with its distinguishing metabolic profile. The determination of infection will be very important for rapidly and efficiently measuring the efficacy of a tailored treatment, leading to prompt and appropriate care of UTI patients.
TI  - [Epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases of Iasi, Romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  - Infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between January 2008 and December 2010 at The Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases Iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). Cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. RESULTS: From 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. Severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high Charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). There were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated, being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative Staphylococci (14/18,66%), Enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group B Streptococcus (3/4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus equi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Sphyngomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). Multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. Meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of S. aureus. Among 16 invazive strains of E. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. There were no E. coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. The mean mortality rate was 14,66%. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of resistance of S. aureus and E. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. Proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Post-operative wound infection in salvage laryngectomy: does antibiotic prophylaxis have an impact?
AB  - Salvage laryngectomy carries a high risk of post-operative infection with reported rates of 40-61%. The purpose of this study was to analyse infections in our own patients and review the potential impact of our current antibiotic prophylaxis (AP). A retrospective analysis of infection in 26 consecutive patients between 2000 and 2010 undergoing salvage total laryngectomy (SL) following recurrent laryngeal cancer after failed radiotherapy or chemo-radiation was undertaken. The antibiotic prophylaxis was intravenous teicoplanin, cefuroxime and metronidazole at induction and for the following 24 h. Infection was defined by Tabet and Johnson's grade 5, categorized as pharyngocutaneous fistula. Fifteen patients (58%) developed a post-operative wound infection, which occurred on average at 12 days after surgery. Univariate analysis demonstrated three risk variables that had a significant correlation with infection: alcohol consumption (p = 0.01), cN stage of tumour (p < 0.01), and pre-operative albumin levels <3.2 g/L (p = 0.012). There was a trend, though not significant, for increased infection in patients with high or low BMIs. The most common organisms isolated from clinical samples from infected patients were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (43%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis (7% each). All these organisms are typical hospital-acquired pathogens. Pseudomonas and Serratia were not covered by the prophylactic regime we used. The current antibiotic regime following SL is inadequate as the rate of infection is high. It would therefore seem logical to trial a separate antibiotic protocol of AP for patients undergoing SL that would include an extended course of antibiotics after the standard prophylaxis. In addition, infection rates may also be reduced by improving the metabolic state of patients pre-operatively by multi-disciplinary action. Steps should also be taken to reduce cross-infection with nosocomial pathogens in these patients. Other aspects of surgical management should be also taken in consideration.
TI  - Antiquorum sensing and antibiofilm potential of Capparis spinosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens often leads to the failure of existing antibiotics to treat bacterial infections; thus, there is a need to seek alternative treatment measures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS) and antibiofilm potential of Capparis spinosa to prevent the onset of bacterial infections as an alternate to antibiotics. METHODS: The methanolic extract of the dried fruits of C. spinosa was assessed for its activity in inhibiting QS-depedent phenomenon such as violacein pigment production in Chromobacterium violaceum, biosurfactant production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, swimming and swarming motility, exopolysaccharide production (EPS) and biofilm formation in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and PAO1. RESULTS: Extract of C. spinosa showed a higher degree of anti-QS activity in a dose dependent manner without affecting the bacterial growth. At 2 mg/mL, this extract significantly (p </=0.005) inhibited the biofilm formation to 79, 75, 73, 70% and EPS production to 58, 46, 66 and 67% in S. marcescens, PAO1, E. coli and P. mirabilis, respectively. It also exhibited inhibition in swimming and swarming motility of bacterial pathogens. The non-enzymatic nature of the anti-QS compound in C. spinosa was confirmed by proteinase K and heat treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Because the methanolic extract of C. spinosa demonstrated anti-QS and antibiofilm activity at 0.5-2 mg/mL, it could be further exploited for novel molecules to treat the emerging infections of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Gram stain microbiological pattern of upper extremities suppuration at Baptist Medical Centre, Ogbomoso Nigeria: a fifteen month review.
AB  - Sixty-eight (68) patients with serious upper extremity suppurative infections, presenting within a period of fifteen (15) months, were prospectively studied clinically, Gram stain of aspirates/pus were performed, specimen cultured, planted, and where indicated glucose levels and haemoglobin genotype determined. Half of the patients had hand infections. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from thirty-nine (39) patients. Gram Negative bacilli, including Salmonella were more isolated from patients with diabetes mellitus or Hgb SS or SC. The Gram stain results correlated with the culture result 90%. When Gram Positive cocci were demonstrated in the primary microscopic examination, cultures were not mandatory. When no organism was demonstrated on primary Gram stain or the patient was diabetic or a sickler, cultures of the specimens were done. The Gram stain, well performed, remains a useful, inexpensive, technologically appropriate laboratory test for abetting decision making in patients with upper extremity suppurative infections. Organisms encountered in this study included: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Coliforms.
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  - The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. Consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. Little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different pH values. Consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (SA) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR Vibrio sp, MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) producing Salmonella sp, ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL producing Proteus mirabilis, ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI)]. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-positive isolates at a pH of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. A mean CZOI of 5 mm was recorded for the SCMC dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the SA dressing. At a pH of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. However, at a pH of 8.5 the mean CZOI of the SCMC dressing was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the SA dressing for a select number of isolates. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the Gram-positive bacteria. Susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. Interestingly, when pH was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (P < 0.05). Overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all pH ranges. In addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when pH became more acidic. The findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role pH plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative organisms from intraabdominal infections and evolution of isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases in the SMART study in Spain (2002-2010).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The SMART (Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends) surveillance study records the antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative bacilli obtain from intraabdominal infections with special focus in isolates with extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility of 8,869 isolates was analyzed by microdilution during the SMART study performed in Spain from 2002 to 2010. Isolates were recovered in 16 centres. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen (60.9% from intraabdominal infections acquired in the community and 49.9% in those from nosocomial origin) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.9% vs 9.2%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more common in intraabdominal infections from nosocomial origin (5.6% community and 8.6% nosocomial). Frequency of ESBL-producing isolates was: E. coli, 8.7%; K. pneumoniae, 8.4%; Klebsiella oxytoca, 1.4%; and Proteus mirabilis, 1.6%. Overall, ESBL-producing isolates were more frequently isolated from elderly patients (6.8% >60 years). Ertapenem and meropenem were the most active antimicrobials (susceptibility range with EUCAST criteria, 89.0-100%) when considering all Enterobacteriaceae isolates and also against ESBL producers (95.5-100%). Susceptibility of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam was lower, particularly among ESBL-producing isolates. Nevertheless, ertapenem maintained a good activity (susceptibility >95%) in ESBL-producers that were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam or fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial susceptibility data from the SMART-Spain study reinforce current therapeutic guidelines of intraabdominal infections that include ertapenem as the empirical choice for treatment. This is also supported by the high frequency of ESBL-producers in our geographic area.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated transfer of the bla(NDM-1) gene in Gram-negative rods.
AB  - The latest threat of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria corresponds to the emergence of carbapenemase NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) producers, mostly in Enterobacteriacae. Five bla(NDM) (-1) -positive plasmids of different incompatibility groups (IncL/M, FII, A/C and two untypeable plasmids) from clinical Enterobacteriaceae were evaluated for conjugation properties and host specificity. Successful conjugative transfers were obtained using all tested enterobacterial species as recipients (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis) and all plasmid types. Conjugation frequencies varied from 1 x 10(-4) to 6 x 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. Higher conjugation rates were obtained for two plasmids at 30 degrees C compared with that observed at 25 and 37 degrees C. Carbapenems used as selector did not lead to higher conjugation frequencies. None of the five plasmids was transferable to Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation. This work underlines how efficient the spread of the carbapenemase bla(NDM) (-1) gene could be among Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Control of Clinical Pathogens by the Haemolymph of Paratelphusa hydrodromous, a Freshwater Crab.
AB  - In the present study, effort has been made to find the antimicrobial activity of  haemolymph collected from freshwater crab, Paratelphusa hydrodromous. The haemolymph collected was tested for antimicrobial assay by disc diffusion method against clinical pathogens. Five bacterial species, namely, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and five fungal strains, namely and Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus sp., and Mucor sp., were selected for the study. The result shows a strong response of haemolymph against the clinical pathogens which confirms the immune mechanism of the freshwater crab.
TI  - Development of an antibiogram in a long-term care facility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To create an antibiogram-a profile of an organism's susceptibility/resistance to a panel of antibiotics- for a long-term care facility to assess the prevalence of resistance of bacteria present at the facility. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of culture and sensitivity data from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. SETTING: A long-term care facility in Huntsville, Alabama. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the long-term care facility that had one or more culture and sensitivity test performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Susceptibility of bacteria to each antimicrobial tested. RESULTS: Results were compiled and reported according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test Data. The most commonly seen bacteria in our long-term care facility were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance rates for these bacteria were high and included the presence of methicillinresistant S. aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. CONCLUSION: Resistance rates were high among all organisms reported. This poses a serious threat to the health care team's ability to effectively treat residents of this facility. Development of an antibiogram to assist physicians in antimicrobial selection will be beneficial in helping evaluate trends in drug resistance to current available treatments. Implementing clinical pathways for empiric treatment of infections could improve the ability to provide consistent treatment for all residents in the facility.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance pattern for gram-negative uropathogens isolated from hospitalised patients and outpatients in Cartagena, 2005-2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determining the microbial aetiology spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitalised patients and outpatients. METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out between February 2005 and November 2008 at the San Buenaventura University's Clinical Laboratory in Cartagena. Antibiotic sensitivity was determined by the Kirby Bauer method. RESULTS: Out of the total specimens (1,384) analysed over the four-year study period, 455 of the urine samples (32.9 %) were culture positive, most (81.4 %) having come from females. The bacterium isolated most frequently was Escherichia coli (60.1 %) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.6 %), Proteus mirabilis (5.4 %) and Acinetobacter baumannii (1.4 %). The Gram-negative isolates displayed a high level of resistance to ampicillin (range 84.3100 %), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range 66.580 %) and ciprofloxacin (range 4057.9 %). CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for urinary tract infections in the patients involved in this study. The most commonly isolated bacteria were E. coli. Empirical administration of a third-generation cephalosporin for initial treatment of urinary tract infections in this population appears prudent from the perspective of antimicrobial susceptibility.
TI  - Molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: Sperm immobilization factor isolated from Staphylococcus aureus immobilizes human spermatozoa as well as motile bacteria, showing that sperm immobilization factor receptor might be shared by bacteria and human spermatozoa. Thus, we sought to identify a common sperm immobilization factor binding receptor on spermatozoa and bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sperm immobilization factor was isolated from S. aureus. Sperm immobilization factor binding receptors were isolated from spermatozoa and bacteria. RESULTS: Antisperm antibodies in humans cross-reacted with bacteria antibodies. Thus, molecular similarities between determinants of spermatozoa and pathogenic microorganisms can be inferred. Sperm immobilization factor isolated from S. aureus immobilized spermatozoa (150 mug/ml) and motile bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis (500 mug/ml). This showed the presence of a common sperm immobilization factor binding conformation on spermatozoa and bacteria. Furthermore, receptors binding sperm immobilization factor were extracted and purified from spermatozoa, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Molecular mimicry between spermatozoa and bacteria was confirmed by observing the blockage of spermatozoa immobilization by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of receptors isolated from spermatozoa, E. coli, P. aeruginosa or P. mirabilis. Also, a higher concentration of sperm immobilization factor (200 mug/ml) caused sperm death. Blocking the death of spermatozoa induced by sperm immobilization factor in the presence of these receptors provided further evidence for a common receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence for molecular similarity between bacteria and spermatozoa.
TI  - Pulmonary zygomycosis with Cunninghamella bertholletiae in a killer whale (Orcinus orca).
AB  - An adult female killer whale (Orcinus orca) was transported to the Port of Nagoya public aquarium in June 2010. While the animal was being maintained in the aquarium there was a gradual decrease in body weight. On October 1st, 2010 the whale exhibited signs of gastrointestinal disease and died on January 14th, 2011. At necropsy examination the gastric compartments were filled with a large number of variably-sized rocks (total weight 81.4 kg) and there was marked ulceration in the third compartment. There were multifocal tubercle-like nodules within the lungs and on sectioning there were numerous abscesses and pulmonary cavities. Microscopically, there was severe suppurative pneumonia associated with fungal hyphae that were infrequently septate and often branched. Numerous bacterial colonies were also present. The hyphae demonstrated immunohistochemical cross-reactivity with Rhizomucor spp. and Cunninghamella bertholletiae was cultured. Bacteriological culture revealed the presence of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas oryzihabitans. This case represents the first documentation of zygomycosis associated with C. bertholletiae in a marine mammal.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Effective cohorting and "superisolation" in a single intensive care unit in response to an outbreak of diverse multi-drug-resistant organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cohorting patients in dedicated hospital wards or wings during infection outbreaks reduces transmission of organisms, yet frequently, this may not be feasible because of inadequate capacity, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). We hypothesized that cohorting isolation patients in one geographic location in a single ICU and using enhanced isolation procedures ("superisolation") can prevent the further spread of highly multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDRO). METHODS: Six patients dispersed throughout our Surgical Trauma Burn ICU had infections with carbapenem-resistant, non-clonal gram-negative MDRO, namely Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Providencia rettgeri. Five of the six patients also had simultaneous isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Under threat of unit closure and after all standard isolation procedures had been enacted, these six patients were moved to the front six beds of the unit, the front entrance was closed, and all traffic was redirected through the back entrance. Nursing staff were assigned to either two isolation or two non-isolation patients. In accordance with the practice of Semmelweis, rounds were conducted so as to end at the rooms of the patients with the most highly-resistant bacterial infections. RESULTS: A few months after these interventions, all six patients had been discharged from the ICU (three alive and three dead), and no new cases of infection with any of their pathogens (based on species and antibiogram) or VRE occurred. The mean ICU stay and overall hospital length of stay for these six patients were 78.3 days and 117.2 days respectively, with a mortality rate of 50%. CONCLUSION: Cohorting patients to one area and altering work routines to minimize contact with patients with MDRO (essentially designating a "high-risk" zone) may be beneficial in stopping patient-to-patient spread of highly resistant bacteria without the need for a dedicated isolation unit.
TI  - Urinary pathogens and drug susceptibility patterns of urinary tract infections among antenatal clinic attendees in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - AIM: To determine the bacterial agents involved in urinary tract infections in pregnant women and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: All consenting subjects who attended antenatal clinics of the University College Hospital and Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, from 1 April 2007 and 30 March 2009 were interviewed to obtain demographic and pregnancy health data. Mid-stream urine samples obtained were processed by standard methods. Confirmed bacterial isolates were tested against seven antibiotics using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: Of the 473 specimens processed, 136 (28.8%) were positive for microscopy, 118 (25.0%) were culture positive, while 18 (3.8%) were microscopy positive but negative for culture. More than 90% of the bacterial isolates were Gram-negative bacilli, of which approximately 80% were members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Klebsiella oxytoca accounted for 45 (38.1%) of the causative agents identified, followed by Escherichia coli (31.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.3%) and Proteus mirabilis (6.8%). Candida albicans accounted for three (2.6%) of the isolates. Ten isolates (22.2%) of K. oxytoca were resistant to cefuroxime while three (6.7%) were resistant to ofloxacin. The only Gram-positive bacterium isolated, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, accounted for four (4.3%) of all pathogens, of which three (75.0%) were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, ofloxacin, cefuroxime and the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the incidence of culture-positive urinary tract infection in pregnancy is common in Ibadan. More studies are needed to evaluate the susceptibility profile of uropathogens to commonly used antibiotics in our environment.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity profile of bacterial pathogens in postoperative wound infections at a tertiary care hospital in Gujarat, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find out the most common bacterial pathogens responsible for post-operative wound infection and their antibiotic sensitivity profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, observational study was carried out in patients of postoperative wound infection. Samples from wound discharge were collected using a sterile swab and studied for identification of isolates by Gram stains and culture growth followed by in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing performed by disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar. RESULTS: Out of 183 organisms, 126 (68.85%) isolated organisms were gram negative. Staphylococcus aureus, 48 (26.23%), was the predominant organism. S. aureus was sensitive to rifampicin (89.58%), levofloxacin (60.42%), and vancomycin (54.17%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to ciprofloxacin (83.78%), gatifloxacin (51.35%), and meropenem (51.35%). Escherichia coli was sensitive to levofloxacin (72.41%) and ciprofloxacin (62.07%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was sensitive to ciprofloxacin (63.16%), levofloxacin (63.16%), gatifloxacin (63.16%), and linezolid (56.52%). Proteus mirabilis was sensitive to ciprofloxacin (75%) and linezolid (62.50). Proteus vulgaris was sensitive to ampicillin+sulbactam (57.14%) followed by levofloxacin (50%). CONCLUSIONS: There is an alarming increase of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly in the emergence of VRSA/VISA, meropenem, and third generation cephalosporin resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Linezolid showing sensitivity against Gram negative bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological activities of five medicinal plant species from Cameroon traditional medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases caused by multiresistant microbial strains are on the increase. Fighting these diseases with natural products may be more efficacious. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic, ethylacetate (EtOAc) and hexanic fractions of five Cameroonian medicinal plants (Piptadeniastum africana, Cissus aralioides, Hileria latifolia, Phyllanthus muellerianus and Gladiolus gregasius) against 10 pathogenic microorganisms of the urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts. METHODS: The fractions were screened for their chemical composition and in vivo acute toxicity was carried out on the most active extracts in order to assess their inhibitory selectivity. The agar well-diffusion and the micro dilution methods were used for the determination of the inhibition diameters (ID) and Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) respectively on 8 bacterial species including two Gram positive species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), and six Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi) and two fungal isolates (Candida albicans, Candida krusei). The chemical composition was done according to Harbone (1976), the acute toxicity evaluation according to WHO protocol and the hepatic as well as serum parameters measured to assess liver and kidney functions. RESULTS: The chemical components of each plant's extract varied according to the solvent used, and they were found to contain alkaloids, flavonoids, polyphenols, triterpens, sterols, tannins, coumarins, glycosides, cardiac glycosides and reducing sugars. The methanolic and ethylacetate extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastum africana presented the highest antimicrobial activities against all tested microorganisms with ID varying from 8 to 26 mm and MIC from 2.5 to 0.31 mg/ml. The in vivo acute toxicity study carried out on the methanolic extracts of Phyllanthus muellerianus and Piptadeniastrum africana indicated that these two plants were not toxic. At the dose of 4 g/kg body weight, kidney and liver function tests indicated that these two medicinal plants induced no adverse effect on these organs. CONCLUSION: These results showed that, all these plant's extracts can be used as antimicrobial phytomedicines which can be therapeutically used against infections caused by multiresistant agents. Phyllanthus muellerianus, Piptadeniastum africana, antimicrobial, acute toxicity, kidney and liver function tests, Cameroon Traditional Medicine.
TI  - Investigation of the antimicrobial activity of Rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.).
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial activity of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ethanol extract from the leaves of rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) was produced at the Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology. The antimicrobial activity of the viscous extract or rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil was evaluated using standard microorganism cultures (bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035 and fungi Candida albicans ATCC 60193). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined preparations was determined. RESULTS. Both studied preparations - rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) - demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity. The highest sensitivity to the studied preparations was observed in microbes with eukaryotic cell structure: Candida albicans, which is a fungus, and a spore-forming prokaryotic bacterium, Bacillus cereus. The highest resistance was observed in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS. The studied preparations - viscous extracts of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil - are substances with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria, spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus), and fungi (Candida albicans).
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two essential oils.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of essential oils in vitro for possible application to reduce the content of microorganisms in the air of animal houses. The essential oils of Cymbopogon citrarus L. and Malaleuca alternifolia L. were screened against bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and yeast Candida albicans. The minimal inhibitory concentration of the active essential oils was tested using broth dilution assay. The essential oils concentrations ranged from 0.1-50.0%. The combined effects of essential oils were tested for Malaleuca alternifolia L. and Cymbopogon citrarus L. concentrations ranged from 0.005-50.0%. The oils showed a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity. Concentrations of 0.1-0.5% of Cymbopogon citrarus L. and Malaleuca alternifolia L. reduced total microorganisms count of Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. High antibacterial activity was also revealed for Cymbopogon citrarus L. with bactericidal concentrations of 0.8% for Escherichia coli, 5.0% for Enterococcus faecium, 5.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 8.0% for Staphylococcus aureus. Bactericidal concentrations of Malaleuca alternifolia L. were 5.0% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecium, and 8.0% for Staphylococcus aureus. The essential oils of Cymbopogon citrarus and Malaleuca alternifolia may be a promising alternative of air disinfection in animal houses.
TI  - Microbiological profile with antibiotic sensitivity pattern of cholesteatomatous  chronic suppurative otitis media among children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is the most common cause of childhood hearing impairment in the developing countries and atticoantral type is associated with increased incidence of intracranial and extracranial complications. This study was undertaken to define the microbiology of atticoantral type of chronic otitis media and the antibiotic sensitivity pattern, thereby reducing the potential risks of complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was done in the Department of Otolaryngology, JIPMER, Puducherry from the year August 2003 to October 2009 using the medical record department database to retrieve the patient details. During this study period, 223 children with atticoantral type CSOM consisting of 126 males and 97 females with an age range of 1-14 years were assessed. Patients with persistent otorrhea for more than 3 months with atticoantral type of chronic otitis media were selected. The exudates were collected under sterile conditions and inoculated onto culture media; bacterial growth and antibiotic sensitivity pattern were studied. RESULTS: Nine species of micro organisms were isolated from the middle ear aspirate, Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most predominant isolate constituting about 32% (72 discharging ears) of the total isolates followed by Proteus mirabilis (20% of isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (19% of isolates). Gram negative organisms accounted 58% of total isolates and gram positive organisms constituted 22% isolates. Candida albicans and methicillin resistant S. aureus were identified in 4% and 2% of isolates, respectively. 100% of Pseudomonas isolates showed susceptibility to ceftazidime and a high sensitivity (92% of isolates) to ciprofloxacin and 88% isolates were sensitive to amikacin. 100% of P. mirabilis isolated from inoculates showed sensitivity to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin. It also showed 87-97% sensitivity to ceftriaxone, amikacin and ampicillin. All (100%) of the Staphylococcus isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and 84-86% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin. In general, gram negative organisms showed increased sensitivity to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin, while gram positive organisms to vancomycin, erythromycin and ciprofoxacin. CONCLUSION: Continuous and periodic evaluation of microbiological pattern and antibiotic sensitivity of cholesteatomatous CSOM is necessary to decrease the potential risks of complications by early institution of appropriate systemic and topical antibiotic alongside mastoid exploration. We believe that our data may contribute to an effective medical management of chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma. Since the most common organisms in our clinical set up being P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis and S. aureus, which showed a percentage susceptibility of 100% to ceftazidime and vancomycin, thus making it an empirical antibiotic combination therapy of choice in the recent times.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of ten medicinal plants against clinical isolates of oral cancer cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppression of immune system in treated cancer patients may lead to secondary infections that obviate the need of antibiotics. In the present study, an attempt was made to understand the occurrence of secondary infections in immuno-suppressed patients along with herbal control of these infections with the following objectives to: (a) isolate the microbial species from the treated oral cancer patients along with the estimation of absolute neutrophile counts of patients (b) assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity medicinal plants against the above clinical isolates. METHODS: Blood and oral swab cultures were taken from 40 oral cancer patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D.S. Health University,Rohtak, Haryana. Clinical isolates were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. The medicinal plants selected for antimicrobial activity analysis were Asphodelus tenuifolius Cav., Asparagus racemosus Willd., Balanites aegyptiaca L., Cestrum diurnum L., Cordia dichotoma G. Forst, Eclipta alba L., Murraya koenigii (L.) Spreng. , Pedalium murex L., Ricinus communis L. and Trigonella foenum graecum L. The antimicrobial efficacy of medicinal plants was evaluated by modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. MIC and MFC were investigated by serial two fold microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (23.2%), Escherichia coli (15.62%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.37%), Klebsiella pneumonia (7.81%), Proteus mirabilis (3.6%), Proteus vulgaris (4.2%) and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans (14.6%), Aspergillus fumigatus (9.37%). Out of 40 cases, 35 (87.5%) were observed as neutropenic. Eight medicinal plants (A. tenuifolius, A. racemosus, B. aegyptiaca, E. alba, M. koenigii, P. murex R. communis and T. foenum graecum) showed significant antimicrobial activity (P < .05) against most of the isolates. The MIC and MFC values were ranged from 31 to 500 mug/ml. P. aeruginosa was observed highest susceptible bacteria (46.6%) on the basis of susceptible index. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that treated oral cancer patients were neutropenic and prone to secondary infection of microbes. The medicinal plant can prove as effective antimicrobial agent to check the secondary infections in treated cancer patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in urinary tract pathogens in Canada from 2007 to 2009:  CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - From January 2007 to December 2009, an annual Canadian national surveillance study (CANWARD) tested 2,943 urinary culture pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibilities according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The most frequently isolated urinary pathogens were as follows (number of isolates, percentage of all isolates): Escherichia coli (1,581, 54%), enterococci (410, 14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (274, 9%), Proteus mirabilis (122, 4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100, 3%), and Staphylococcus aureus (80, 3%). The rates of susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) were 78, 86, 84, and 93%, respectively, for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and S. aureus. The rates of susceptibility to nitrofurantoin were 96, 97, 33, and 100%, respectively, for E. coli, enterococci, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. The rates of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were 81, 40, 86, 81, 66, and 41%, respectively, for E. coli, enterococci, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. Statistical analysis of resistance rates (resistant plus intermediate isolates) by year for E. coli over the 3-year study period demonstrated that increased resistance rates occurred only for amoxicillin-clavulanate (from 1.8 to 6.6%; P < 0.001) and for SXT (from 18.6 to 24.3%; P = 0.02). For isolates of E. coli, in a multivariate logistic regression model, hospital location was independently associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (P = 0.026) with higher rates of resistance observed in inpatient areas (medical, surgical, and intensive care unit wards). Increased age was also associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin (P < 0.001) and with resistance to two or more commonly prescribed oral agents (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and SXT) (P = 0.005). We conclude that frequently prescribed empirical agents for urinary tract infections, such as SXT and ciprofloxacin, demonstrate lowered in vitro susceptibilities when tested against recent clinical isolates.
TI  - Lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  - A number of Lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. We have isolated L. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi A, Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio sp. In addition to lactic acid, L. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral pH (pH 7.0). The compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. Lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Isolated cell surface associated proteins (SAPs) from L. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic E. coli. Our results indicate that L. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and SAPs to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in Egypt.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM) is a rare disease with a high rate of mortality. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of primary and secondary GNBM and to evaluate the efficacy of ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin) in the treatment of this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted including 95 patients with GNBM admitted to the Abbassia and Imbaba fever hospitals' meningitis wards in Egypt during the period from 1993 to the end of the year 2009. Their cerebrospinal fluid samples were subjected to conventional bacteriological methods for isolation of the causative Gram-negative bacilli. Forty-nine patients had primary GNBM (no predisposing cause of meningitis was detected) and 46 patients had secondary GNBM (with a predisposing cause of meningitis). RESULTS: Primary GNBM was characterized by an abrupt onset and was significantly associated with typical signs of meningeal irritation. The most common infecting organisms were Salmonella typhi in 16 (33%) patients and Escherichia coli in 15 (31%) patients. Of the patients with primary GNBM, 26 (53%) were cured, 11 (22%) developed neurological sequalae, and 12 (24%) patients died. Secondary GNBM was characterized by an insidious onset and significantly associated with unarousable coma. The most common infecting organisms were Proteus mirabilis in 17 (37%) patients and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 16 (35%) patients. The most common predisposing factor of meningitis was otitis media and occurred in 26 (57%) patients. Of the patients with secondary GNBM, 15 (33%) were cured, 15 (33%) developed neurological sequalae, and 16 (35%) died. Primary GNBM was significantly associated with a higher cure rate than secondary GNBM. The duration of symptoms in patients with secondary GNBM was significantly higher than in those with primary GNBM. Ceftriaxone was the initial drug for treatment of these patients until the antibiotic sensitivity tests were reported. The overall resistance rate to the drug was 4%. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: GNBM still has a high mortality rate and should be managed as a medical emergency. GNBM should be suspected in patients with otitis media, neurosurgical, and head trauma or who underwent spinal anesthesia and have disturbance in their level of consciousness, even if there are no signs of meningeal irritation. Ceftriaxone is still an effective drug and had a low rate of resistance in our study.
TI  - Synergistic combination of chitosan acetate with nanoparticle silver as a topical antimicrobial: efficacy against bacterial burn infections.
AB  - Chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. Here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a CFU assay. The hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. A dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn model infected with bioluminescent P. aeruginosa. The survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (P = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and P = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. Most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. Silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. These data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.
TI  - Identification of bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and their ability to produce superantigens and biofilms in Lebanese patients.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus superantigens and bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the development of chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. We conducted a study of 32 Lebanese patients-21 males and 11 females, aged 15 to 71 years (mean: 39)-to identify bacteria isolated from nasal polyps and to determine if these bacteria produced superantigens and biofilms. Polyps were surgically removed, homogenized, and subjected to bacteriologic studies. The presence or absence of S aureus enterotoxin A, B, C, and D (superantigen) genes was determined in all isolates by polymerase chain reaction. Biofilm production by coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed by tissue culture plate assay. A total of 34 bacterial species/groups were isolated from the nasal polyps. Of these, only 3 (8.8%) were S aureus, and only 1 possessed an enterotoxin-coding gene (enterotoxin B). Moreover, of the 21 coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates that were found, none possessed the investigated genes, and only 1 had a strong biofilm-formation property. Our results could not confirm that S aureus enterotoxins (superantigens) or biofilm-producing bacteria play a role in the development of nasal polyps in the Lebanese group studied.
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala (Asteraceae).
AB  - Some Vernonia species (Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala) used in Northern Nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. The antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the NCCLS was carried out on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysentriae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas fluorescence. The results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the Vernonia species being studied. The activity of chloroform fraction of V. blumeoides was higher on C. ulcerans and K. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of V. oocephala and V. ambigua were more active on P. mirabilis (27 mm) and S. typhi (22 mm), respectively. It is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three Vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/mL for all the organisms tested. The MIC of 1.25 mg/mL exhibited by the chloroform fractions on both Gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the Vernonia species being studied. Phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. The antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. The overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. This lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria in 2006].
AB  - We determined MICs of antibacterial agents against 1280 clinical strains of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (19 genus or species) isolated at 16 Japanese facilities in 2006. MICs were determined using mostly broth microdilution method and antibacterial activity was assessed. Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) accounted for 3.7% of Escherichia coli, 2.7% of Klebsiella spp., and 11.4% of Proteus spp. Notably, 18.8% of Proteus mirabilis was found to produce ESBL higher than 16.7% in 2004. This result was higher extremely than other species. Among Haemophilus influenzae, only 1.2% produced beta-lactamase and 62.8% that increased compared with 57.7% in 2004, were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains when classified by penicillin-binding protein 3 mutation. Although few antibacterial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa have potent activity, only three agents--doripenem, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin-showed an MIC90 of 4 microg/mL. Of all P aeruginosa strains, 5.7% were resistant to six or more agents of nine antipseudomonal agents, a decrease compared to 8.7% in 2004. Against other glucose-non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of most antibacterial agents was similar to that in 2004.
TI  - Monitoring of multiple drug-resistant pathogens in a selected stretch of Bay of Bengal, India.
AB  - The present work aims at identification of multiple drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria in a selected stretch, namely, Puri on the Bay of Bengal, India. Six stations at the coast of Puri were selected and samples of water and sediment were collected during the winter of 2008 and 2009 for this study. Thirty-eight pathogenic bacteria were isolated and identified from both the water and the sediment of 6 fixed stations (PU-1a, PU-1b, PU-2, PU-3, PU-4, and PU-5). The identified pathogens were Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated bacteria was studied by using 12 selected antibiotics, commonly used for the medication of human beings and animals. The isolated pathogens from both the water and the sediment samples showed lowest resistance to chloramphenicol (C-30 mug) where as the pathogens showed highest level of resistance to ampicillin (10-mug) among the antibiotics used for the study. Among the isolated pathogens E. faecalis (PU-1a), P. aeruginosa (PU-2 and PU-3), E. coli (PU-3 and PU-4), and K. pneumonia (PU-4) showed resistance to more than four antibiotics. Out of the isolated species, 57.8% pathogens were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic resistance indexes of all the stations were calculated and found to be in the range of 0.066 to 0.083.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of urinary tract pathogens in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) affect all age groups and occur in both hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals and have serious impact on the socioeconomic life of the individual and the society, and also account for a large proportion of antibacterial drug consumption. Treatment failure has been attributed to increasing resistance to common antibiotics, but there is paucity of data from this part of Nigeria. This prospective study was carried out to determine the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of uropathogens in Ibadan using standard microbiological diagnostic methods. Statistical analysis was by simple percentages among related variables. Four hundred and nine urinary isolates, 239 (58.4%) and 170 (41.6%) from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients respectively were studied. Frequency of occurrence of urinary pathogens were Klebsiella spp 171 (41.8%), Pseudomonas species (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) 81 (19.8%), Escherichia coli 78 (19.1%), Staphylococcus aureus 31 (7.6%) and Proteus mirabilis 31 (7.6%). Resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as ampicillin 97%, tetracycline 93%, cotrimoxazole 98%, and amoxycillin 89% was observed among most uropathogens. Seventy-five to 100% Pseudomonas spp. were resistant to the common antibiotics and also 87.1% and 82.4% were resistant to nalidixic acid and cefuroxime respectively. However, appreciable susceptibility by all uropathogens was found with amikacin 75%, ciprofloxacin 72.2%, ceftriaxone 68.4%, and pefloxacin 64.9%. Isolates from the community showed more susceptibility to tested drugs. In conclusion, widespread resistance to most antibiotics including cephalosporins and quinolones was found among all uropathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against DNA virus herpes simplex type 1 and RNA virus parainfluenza (type-3). Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. Antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. RESULTS: Atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
TI  - Relationship between the cAMP levels in leukocytes and the cytokine balance in patients surviving gram negative bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated leukocytes secrete proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12. Over-activation of host defense systems may result in severe tissue damage and requires regulation. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-10 are candidate cytokines for inducing tolerance to lipopolysaccharide re-stimulation. We compared cytokines secreted by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood cells from patients who had survived gram negative bacterial pneumonia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis, n = 26) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 18). Interleukin-12p70 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression was significantly lower in patients (p = 0.0039 and p<0.001) compared to healthy controls, while granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production was markedly higher in patients (p<0.001). Levels of interleukin-10 were comparable. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor expression was inversely correlated with interleukin-12p70 (R = -0.71, p<0.001) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (R = -0.64, p<0.001) expression; interleukin-10 showed no significant correlation. In unstimulated leukocytes from patients, cAMP levels were significantly raised (p = 0.020) and were correlated inversely with interleukin-12p70 levels (R = -0.81, p<0.001) and directly with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (R = 0.72, p = 0.0020), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (R = 0.67, p = 0.0067) and interleukin-10 (R = 0.54, p = 0.039) levels. Our results demonstrate that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated leukocytes is a useful indicator of tolerance induction in surviving pneumonia patients and that measuring cAMP in freshly isolated leukocytes may also be clinically significant.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the indigenous earthworms Lampito mauritii (Kinberg) and Perionyx excavatus (Perrier).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Earthworms respond to microbial infection through cellular and humoral defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial protein secretions. Most of the humoral defense proteins are synthesized in the skin itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, a dried powder was prepared from two indigenous earthworms (Lampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus) and tested against two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and five gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: The dried earthworm powder of two species shows a strong antibacterial activity against the S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa bacterial strains. Of these, the 60 mug/mL/disc of P. excavatus earthworm powder shows more activity than the L. mauritii.
TI  - Influence of referral bias on the clinical characteristics of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection.
AB  - Referral bias can influence the results of studies performed at tertiary-care centres. In this study, we evaluated demographic and microbiological factors that influenced referral of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection (BSI). We identified 2919 and 846 unique patients with Gram-negative BSI in a referral cohort of patients treated at Mayo Clinic Hospitals and a population-based cohort of Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2007, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with referral. Elderly patients aged >/=80 years with Gram-negative BSI were less likely to be referred than younger patients [odds ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.30-0.62] as were females (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.53-0.74). After adjusting for age and gender, bloodstream isolates of Escherichia coli (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.43-0.58) and Proteus mirabilis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.82) were underrepresented in the referral cohort; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.70-3.06), Enterobacter cloacae (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.53-3.66), Serratia marcescens (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.33-4.52) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (OR 17.94, 95% CI 3.98-314.43) were overrepresented in the referral cohort. We demonstrated that demographic and microbiological characteristics of patients with Gram-negative BSI had an influence on referral patterns. These factors should be considered when interpreting results of investigations performed at tertiary-care centres.
TI  - Screening of bloodborne pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility testing among  cancer patients.
AB  - AIM: To screen bloodborne pathogens and test for antimicrobial susceptibility among patients with different types of cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty volunteers undergoing chemotherapy in Madurai, Tamilnadu (14 males and 36 females) provided blood samples with consent for identification of pathogens by streaking on different selective and differential media. The antibiotic sensitivity for the entire isolates were tested by the Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be present in more samples than Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and E.coli. Percentage sensitivities of blood pathogens to selected antibiotics were found to be: Amikacin 61%, Gentamicin 68%, Co-Trimoxole 31%, and Cefepime 42.8%.
TI  - The nationwide study of bacterial pathogens associated with urinary tract infections conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy.
AB  - This study was conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and is the first nationwide study on bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with urinary tract infections at 28 hospitals throughout Japan between January 2008 and June 2008. A total of 688 bacterial strains were isolated from adult patients with urinary tract infections. The strains investigated in this study are as follows: Enterococcus faecalis (n = 140), Escherichia coli (n = 255), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 93), Proteus mirabilis (n = 42), Serratia marcescens (n = 44), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 114). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 39 antibacterial agents used for these strains were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) manual. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Although a majority of the E. faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid, 11 strains (7.8%) were found to be intermediately resistant. The proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and S. marcescens strains were 35.7%, 29.3%, 18.3%, and 15.2%, respectively. The proportions of E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, and S. marcescens strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were 5.1%, 11.9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The proportions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones were 9.2%, 4.4%, and 34.8%, respectively, and among them, 2 strains (1.8%) were found to be multidrug resistant. These data present important information for the proper treatment of urinary tract infections and will serve as a useful reference for periodic surveillance studies in the future.
TI  - Photodynamic therapy with a cationic functionalized fullerene rescues mice from fatal wound infections.
AB  - AIMS: Fullerenes are under intensive study for potential biomedical applications. We have previously reported that a C60 fullerene functionalized with three dimethylpyrrolidinium groups (BF6) is a highly active broad-spectrum antimicrobial photosensitizer in vitro when combined with white-light illumination. We asked whether this high degree of in vitro activity would translate into an in vivo therapeutic effect in two potentially lethal mouse models of infected wounds. MATERIALS & METHODS: We used stable bioluminescent bacteria and a low light imaging system to follow the progress of the infection noninvasively in real time. An excisional wound on the mouse back was contaminated with one of two bioluminescent Gram-negative species, Proteus mirabilis (2.5 x 10(7) cells) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 x 10(6) cells). A solution of BF6 was placed into the wound followed by delivery of up to 180 J/cm(2) of broadband white light (400-700 nm). RESULTS: In both cases there was a light-dose-dependent reduction of bioluminescence from the wound not observed in control groups (light alone or BF6 alone). Fullerene-mediated photodynamic therapy of mice infected with P. mirabilis led to 82% survival compared with 8% survival without treatment (p < 0.001). Photodynamic therapy of mice infected with highly virulent P. aeruginosa did not lead to survival, but when photodynamic therapy was combined with a suboptimal dose of the antibiotic tobramycin (6 mg/kg for 1 day) there was a synergistic therapeutic effect with a survival of 60% compared with a survival of 20% with tobramycin alone (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that cationic fullerenes have clinical potential as an antimicrobial photosensitizer for superficial infections where red light is not needed to penetrate tissue.
TI  - Necrotising otitis externa: an unusual cause of cranial nerve palsy in a diabetic haemodialysis patient.
AB  - We present an unusual case of necrotising otitis externa (NOE) causing a lower motor neurone facial nerve palsy in a patient with diabetes mellitus and receiving maintenance haemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen isolated in NOE, although our case involved the non-typical pathogens Aspergillus flavus and Proteus mirabilis. We discuss the need for diagnostic rigour and the importance of considering atypical infective pathology in patients with ESRD or diabetes mellitus. We review NOE with reference to causative agents, imaging strategies, prognostic indicators and treatment.
TI  - Incidence of postoperative eye infections in a private eye hospital in Lagos, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a dearth of information on postoperative eye infections in Nigeria and most hospitals do not have an infection control program in place. OBJECTIVE: This study was done to investigate the incidence of post-operative eye infections, their potential sources and the preparedness of the hospital to prevent such infections. METHODS: A microbiological survey of all eye surgical procedures between March 2004 and May 2005 was performed. Relevant samples were taken and cultured pre, intra and post operatively as required. Definitions of infections were based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Criteria. In the eye clinic, and operation theatre, infection control procedures and practices were audited using a pre-designed questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 2 cases of post operative eye infections (with Haemophilus influenzae and Corynebacterium species) during the one year of survey of 339 performed surgeries. S. aureus, Coagulase negative staphylococcus (CNS), and Enterobacter spp were cultured from the aqueous humour, as well as pre and post operative conjunctivae swabs of three other patients. Eighty four (24.8%) other patients were colonized post operatively with CNS (32), S. aureus (28), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), E. coli (5), Corynebacterium species (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1) Proteus mirabilis (4), Enterobacter species alone (1) and in association with CNS on 2 occasions. Seventy eight percent of patients had contact with staff who consistently haboured Staphylococcus species in their nares. Four patients (0.11%) were exposed to surgeons whose hands were contaminated and one eye (0.003%) to contaminated antiseptic solution. Facilities for hand washing and protective clothing were adequate but staffs were observed to perform an inadequate hands scrubbing. Most items were heat sterilized. Cleaning facilities were adequate and the environment was clean. The choice of antiseptic was correct, but that of disinfectant was considered incorrect. The ophthalmic equipments except the eye occluder were appropriately disinfected. Staffs were not protected when handling linen. Infected linens were separated from soiled linens only in the theatre. They were not bagged, and were hand sluiced. The only type of waste that was properly handled was sharps. All waste types were stored together prior to final disposal away from the public. CONCLUSION: The incidence of post-operative infection was 1.69% and their sources were the patients' normal flora. Other potential sources of post-operative eye infections identified included nares of hospital staff, hands of surgeon and hospital disinfectants. Areas of deficiencies in infection control practices, which require proper infection control policies, include hand scrubbing practices, disinfection, linen management and waste handling.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of intra-abdominal gram-negative bacilli from Europe: SMART Europe 2008.
AB  - As part of the worldwide Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART), a total of 3,030 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli from intra-abdominal infections were collected from 43 hospital centres from 13 European countries during 2008. Of 51 species, the most commonly isolated species were Escherichia coli (49.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.6%). Respectively, 17.9%, 11.6%, 5.5% and 4.5% of K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and K. oxytoca were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive. All isolates were tested using a panel of 12 antimicrobial agents, and susceptibilities were determined using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) clinical breakpoints. The most active agents against the study isolates (including those producing ESBLs) were amikacin, ertapenem and imipenem. Overall, with the exception of the carbapenems, most agents exhibited dramatically reduced susceptibilities against ESBL-positive and multi-drug-resistant isolates.
TI  - Synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The synergistic activity between nitric oxide (NO) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (PROLI/NO) and silver(I) sulfadiazine (AgSD) was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. The combination of NO and AgSD was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) was calculated to be <0.5. Gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the Gram-positive bacteria, while Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. The in vitro synergistic activity of AgSD and NO observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility pattern in urinary isolates of gram negative bacilli with special reference to AmpC beta-lactamase in a tertiary care hospital.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to higher antimicrobial agent is commonly seen in gram negative bacilli. This issue is a challenging problem to the medical practitioners in addition to it is financial impact on the health care system. OBJECTIVES: To document the prevalence of multi drug resistant gram negative bacilli isolated from urine of patients attending the Urology Department of Tertiary care Hospital of western India in year 2008. RESULTS: Out of total 328 isolates, 118 (35.98%) E.coli, 72 (21.95 %) Klebsiella, 64 (19.51%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 30 (9.15%) Acinetobacter, 18 (5.49%) Proteus vulgaris, 18 (5.49%) Proteus mirabilis, 6 (1.83%) Providencia rettgerii, 2 (0.61%) Citrobacter freundii. Out of these isolates, 228 (69.51%) were beta-lactamase positive, while 100 (30.51%) were beta-lactamase negative. Out of 228 beta-lactamase positive, 104 (45.61%) were AmpC beta-lactamase positive. CONCLUSIONS: Stringent protocol such as Antibiotic policy and Hospital infection control program are mandatory to curb these microbes in a tertiary care hospital.
TI  - Synthesis and spectrum of the neoglycoside ACHN-490.
AB  - ACHN-490 is a neoglycoside, or "next-generation" aminoglycoside (AG), that has been identified as a potentially useful agent to combat drug-resistant bacteria emerging in hospitals and health care facilities around the world. A focused medicinal chemistry campaign produced a collection of over 400 sisomicin analogs from which ACHN-490 was selected. We tested ACHN-490 against two panels of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, many of which harbored AG resistance mechanisms. Unlike legacy AGs, ACHN-490 was active against strains expressing known AG-modifying enzymes, including the three most common such enzymes found in Enterobacteriaceae. ACHN-490 inhibited the growth of AG-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MIC(90), </=4 mug/ml), with the exception of Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteae (MIC(90), 8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml, respectively). ACHN-490 was more active alone in vitro against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates with AG-modifying enzymes than against those with altered permeability/efflux. The MIC(90) of ACHN-490 against AG-resistant staphylococci was 2 mug/ml. Due to its promising in vitro and in vivo profiles, ACHN-490 has been advanced into clinical development as a new antibacterial agent.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a phospholipase A2 from the venom of the Saw-scaled viper: Novel bactericidal and membrane damaging activities.
AB  - Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), a common toxic component of snake venom, has been implicated in various pharmacological effects. In this study, a basic myotoxic PLA(2), named EcTx-I was isolated from Echis carinatus snake venom by using gel filtration on Superdex G-75, and reverse phase HPLC on C18 and C8 Sepharose columns. PLA(2), EcTx-I was 13,861.72 molecular weight as estimated by MALDI-TOF (15 kD by SDS-PAGE), and consisted of 121 amino acid residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. The N-terminal sequences revealed significant homology with basic myotoxic PLA(2)s from other snake venoms. The purified PLA(2) EcTx-I was evaluated (250 mug/ml) for bactericidal activity of a wide variety of human pathogens against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW&TES), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. EcTx-I showed strong antibacterial activity against B. pseudomallei (KHW) and E. aerogenes among the tested bacteria. Other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria showed only a moderate effect. However, the Gram-positive bacterium E. aerogenes failed to show any effect on EcTx-I protein at tested doses. The most significant bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of EcTx-I was observed at MICs of >15 mug/ml against (B. pseudomallei, KHW) and MICs >30 mug/ml against E. aerogenes. Mechanisms of bactericidal and membrane damaging effects were proved by ultra-structural analysis. EcTx-I was able to induce cytotoxicity on THP-1 cells in vitro as well as lethality in BALB/c mice. EcTx-I also induced mild myotoxic effects on mouse skin, but was devoid of hemolytic effects on human erythrocytes up to 500 mug/ml. It is shown that the toxic effect induced by E. carinatus venom is due to the presence of myotoxic PLA(2) (EcTx-I). The result also corroborates the hypothesis of an association between toxic and enzymatic domains. In conclusion, EcTx-I displays a heparin binding C-terminal region, which is probably responsible for the cytotoxic and bactericidal effects.
TI  - Seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd in southern Brazil.
AB  - The seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd grown in southern Brazil was analyzed by GC-MS, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. The yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. The results obtained from principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. The samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. Samples collected during winter contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). In autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). Samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. The observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. The essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), indicated that S. aureus, B. subtilis, and Candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest MIC values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/mL, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/mL, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of microorganisms isolated from urine in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega].
AB  - The urinary tract is one of the more common sites of bacterial infections, especially in women. Urinary infection can be defined as an infection of urinary tract structures which occurs, generally, as a consequence of the presence or colonization by urine bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. From February 2008 to January 2009, 18653 urine cultures were analyzed. From these cultures 1037 were positive. From this total of positive cultures, 18,3% were from males and 81.7% were from females. In bacteriological positive tests, 23 different strains of microorganisms were found. It was verified that the most frequent microorganism was Escherichia coli, followed by Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For antimicrobial susceptibility it was verified that Escherichia coli showed low susceptibility to amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole. Proteus mirabilis showed good susceptibility to cefotaxime and low to cotrimoxazole, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. For Klebsiella pneumoniae was found only a reasonable susceptibility to gentamicin and Enterococcus faecalis showed amoxicillin susceptibility. Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to all antibiotics analyzed with the exception of the combination piperacillin/tazobactam. In conclusion, this study shows that Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the three main microorganisms that causes urinary infections in the region of Vale do Sousa and Tamega. Therefore, the antimicrobial empirically used must have a spectrum against enterobacteria, because they are the most likely to be present in urinary tract infections acquired in the community. A periodic analysis of the susceptibility profile should be performed over time for each region in order to help in the beginning of the empirical antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Surface bacteriology of venous leg ulcers and healing outcome.
AB  - AIM: Bacteria can be cultured from all venous leg ulcers (VLUs) regardless of healing status, and the significance of a positive swab result in non-clinically infected ulcers is unknown. The aim of this study was to characterise the bacteriological flora of VLUs by routine culture to determine whether the data generated had prognostic value. METHODS: The ulcers of 178 patients were sampled weekly for 12 weeks and healing outcome monitored while the limb was treated with graduated compression. Wound bacteriology was assessed using culture methodology standardised to ensure data reproducibility. RESULTS: 153 individual bacterial species were identified. The species most frequently found were Staphylococcus aureus (64.3% of assessments), Corynebacterium striatum (60.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32.6%), Helcococcus kunzii (22.0%), Finegoldia magna (21.4%) and Proteus mirabilis (16.1%). No single species or the presence of anaerobes and increasing diversity of bacterial species, previously thought to be predictive of impaired healing, was shown to be associated with healing outcome. The presence of C striatum was associated with healing outcome but not after adjusting for the known prognostic factors of wound area and duration. CONCLUSION: Routine bacteriological culture analysis of the VLU wound surface may be used to identify diverse flora in all ulcers. However, the data generated are of no additional value as a prognostic indicator of healing outcome. The presence of C striatum may represent colonisation of non-healing VLU by normal skin flora.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts from plants of central Argentina--isolation of an active principle from Achyrocline satureioides.
AB  - The great increase in bacterial infections is fueling interest in the search for  antibacterial products of plant origin. Extracts obtained from 51 native and naturalized plants from central Argentina were therefore evaluated for their IN VITRO inhibitory activity on pathogenic bacteria with the aim of selecting the most active ones as new sources of effective antibiotics. The susceptibility of reference and clinical strains of Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus was determined. Extracts from Achyrocline satureioides, Flourensia oolepis, Lepechinia floribunda, and Lithrea molleoides were the most potent, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.006 to 2 and 0.012 to 10 mg/mL, respectively, on both gram-positive and negative bacteria. The antibacterial activity-guided isolation of A. satureioides ethanol extract showed 23-methyl-6-O-desmethylauricepyrone (1) to be the most active compound. This compound showed inhibitory effects against gram-positive bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 0.002 and 0.008 mg/mL, respectively, while on gram-negative strains, the MIC and MBC were 0.062-0.250 and 0.062-0.500 mg/mL, respectively. The strong antibacterial activity shown by the four plant extracts or the compound isolated from A. satureioides suggests that they could become part of the arsenal of antibacterial drugs currently used.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two Croatian hospitals: MYSTIC study results.
AB  - The meropenem yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. We now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective Gram-negative pathogen groups from two Croatian Hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. A total of 1510 Gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution method according to CLSI.There was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. High resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. Acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant Gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. Almost 20% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in E. coli was 10% and in K. pneumoniae 49%. PCR and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of SHV-5 in nine E. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. Five K. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(SHV-5 )gene. Eight ESBL positive Enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and CtX-m beta-lactamases. Plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases were not found among K. pneumoniae, E. coli and Enterobacter spp. Three A. baumannii strains from Zagreb University Center were identified by multiplex PCR as OXA-58 like producers. Six A. baumannii strains from Split University Center were found to possess an ISAba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(OXA-51 )gene. According to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria. These data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for A. Baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria causing otitis externa in dogs.
AB  - Bacterial agents are considered important pathogens causing external otitis in dogs. It is essential to carry out bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test in the case of otitis externa, particularly for chronic or recurring cases. Sterile swab samples were obtained from terminal part of vertical ear canals of 74 dogs with otitis externa for cytology, bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. Cytologic smears were stained using Gram and Giemsa staining methods. Aerobic bacterial culture performed on blood agar and MacConkey agar. Among total number of 92 isolated bacteria, 68 were Staphylococcus intermedius. Other isolated bacteria included: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella canis, and six other species of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Antimicrobial susceptibility test were performed for all isolated bacteria using 14 antibiotics. Based on the results of this study, all isolated Staphylococcus spp. were sensitive to amikacin, enrofloxacin, and rifampin, and had low resistance to gentamicin, cephalothin and ceftriaxone. More than half of gram-positive isolates were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Generally, all isolated gram-negative bacteria, were sensitive to amikacin and enrofloxacin, and had low resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin. They were highly resistant to penicillin, eythromycin, and cephalothin. Regarding the results of this study, in cases of uncomplicated otitis externa, it is possible to select antimicrobial drugs merely based on cytology, but it is recommended to perform bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. However, in complicated or refractory cases, antimicrobials should be selected based on bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-negative nonurinary bacteria to fosfomycin and other antimicrobials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fosfomycin is an antimicrobial commonly used in uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The microbiological effectiveness of fosfomycin against nonurinary Gram-negative isolates has not been widely investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of fosfomycin against Gram-negative nonurinary isolates in a region of Greece where considerable antimicrobial resistance has been detected. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the microbiological library of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete. We retrospectively examined the susceptibility of all Gram-negative nonurinary isolates to fosfomycin, collected over 1 year (January-December 2008). RESULTS: A total of 594 nonurinary Gram-negative isolates were examined. Susceptibility testing was performed for 270 (45.4%) Enterobacteriaceae, 209 (35.2%) Gram-negative nonfermentative bacilli and 115 (19.4%) other Gram-negative bacteria. In total, 385 (64.8%) were susceptible to fosfomycin. Specifically, all Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella species isolates were susceptible. Additionally, 73 out of 94 (77.7%) Klebsiella pneumoniae (including carbapenem-resistant strains), 22 out of 32 (68.8%) Enterobacter species and 51 out of 79 (64.5%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to fosfomycin. Susceptibility was highest amongst isolates (45 of 61; 73.8%) taken from outpatients and lowest for intensive care unit isolates (78 of 161; 48.4%). Isolates originating from the pediatric wards exhibited higher susceptibility (45 of 63; 71.4%) than isolates originating from other departments (340 of 531; 64%). CONCLUSION: In a region with relatively high levels of antimicrobial resistance, fosfomycin seems to exhibit good levels of in vitro activity against Gram-negative nonurinary isolates. These data justify further evaluation of its potential clinical effectiveness.
TI  - Development of an oregano-based ointment with anti-microbial activity including activity against methicillin-resistant Staphlococcus aureus.
AB  - Increasing antibiotic resistance has prompted a search for new compounds with anti-microbial activity. In the authors' previous study, oregano extract was identified as one of the most potent anti-microbial compounds. The disk diffusion method was employed to assess the degree of inhibition against various microorganisms, and the bacteriostatic or bactericidal mechanism of action. Disk diffusion studies showed that oregano was found to be bacteriostatic for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, (MRSA) but bacteriocidal for seven other microorganisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa could not be inhibited by oregano. An ointment consisting of 1-10% oregano could inhibit most organisms except for Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, which required 20% and Pseudomonas which could not be inhibited even at the highest concentration of 80%. Oregano extracts can be formulated into an ointment that shows broad antimicrobial activity. Additional testing to assess tissue toxicity and other adverse reactions would be needed prior to human testing.
TI  - Microbiological profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In bacterial conjunctivitis, clinical presentations are not diagnostic of the causative agent, therefore, microbiological analysis is mandatory for specific treatment option. This study was undertaken to determine the microbiology profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in our environment. METHODOLOGY: This is a laboratory-based study carried out in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Conjunctival swabs collected from 365 patients with clinically diagnosed conjunctivitis, were analysed by standard bacteriological methods. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 342 (93.7%) conjunctival samples while 23(6.3%) were sterile. Of the pathogens, 256 (74.9%) were Staphylococcus aureus, 35(10.2%) Coagulase- negative staphylococci, 22 (6.4%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 11(3.2%) Escherichia coli, 7(2.1%) Klebsiella species, 5(1.5%) Streptococcus pneumoniae , 4(1.2%) Haemophilus influenzae, 1(0.3%) Proteus mirabilis, and 1(0.3%)Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The highest rate of conjunctivitis 96(26.3%) was found among infants and children (0-10years).Resistance rates to most of the tested antibiotics were high. However, 67% of them were susceptible to ceftriaxone while only 39.2% were susceptible to chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This study has recorded high antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens of conjunctivitis in this environment; therefore, determining the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens to available antibiotics is crucial to effective management of bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Microbial colonization of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses (Provox2) following  total laryngectomy.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of individual microorganisms and the most frequent microbial combinations in the biofilm of the indwelling Provox2 voice prosthesis in situ. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate the possible influence of biofilm composition on the mean and median lifetime of these voice prostheses. Over a 5-year period, implantation of a Provox2 voice prosthesis was performed in 85 patients, or 90% of the overall number of patients who underwent total laryngectomy. In total 100 implanted voice prostheses, at least one of every patient, were microbiologically processed immediately after being replaced. Out of the total of 292 isolates, 67% were bacteria and the remaining 33% were yeasts. The most frequently found yeast species on voice prostheses biofilms was C. albicans, followed by C. krusei and C. tropicalis. The most frequently isolated bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. Simultaneous presence of bacteria and fungi was established in 83% of the processed voice prostheses; in 16% of samples the biofilm contained only one or more bacterial species. The mean time of implantation was 238 days and the median lifetime of the device was 180 days. Dividing the prostheses in four groups according to the composition of biofilm revealed that the device lifetimes varied significantly between groups. The longest lifetime of voice prostheses was associated with the presence of single fungal isolate in combination with bacteria. There is a significant correlation between biofilm composition and the device life time.
TI  - Assessing the emergence of resistance: the absence of biological cost in vivo may compromise fosfomycin treatments for P. aeruginosa infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fosfomycin is a cell wall inhibitor used efficiently to treat uncomplicated urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections. A very convenient feature of fosfomycin, among others, is that although the expected frequency of resistant mutants is high, the biological cost associated with mutation impedes an effective growth rate, and bacteria cannot offset the obstacles posed by host defenses or compete with sensitive bacteria. Due to the current scarcity of new antibiotics, fosfomycin has been proposed as an alternative treatment for other infections caused by a wide variety of bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, whether fosfomycin resistance in P. aeruginosa provides a fitness cost still remains unknown. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We herein present experimental evidence to show that fosfomycin resistance cannot only emerge easily during treatment, but that it is also cost-free for P. aeruginosa. We also tested if, as has been reported for other species such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, fosfomycin resistant strains are somewhat compromised in their virulence. As concerns colonization, persistence, lung damage, and lethality, we found no differences between the fosfomycin resistant mutant and its sensitive parental strain. The probability of acquisition in vitro of resistance to the combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics (tobramycin and imipenem) has also been studied. While the combination of fosfomycin with tobramycin makes improbable the emergence of resistance to both antibiotics when administered together, the combination of fosfomycin plus imipenem does not avoid the appearance of mutants resistant to both antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: We have reached the conclusion that the use of fosfomycin for P. aeruginosa infections, even in combined therapy, might not be as promising as expected. This study should encourage the scientific community to assess the in vivo cost of resistance for specific antibiotic-bacterial species combinations, and therefore avoid reaching universal conclusions from single model organisms.
TI  - [Characteristics of urinary tract infections in different patient subpopulations  and depending on the bladder emptying system].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To analyze the prevalence and etiology of urinary tract infection in patients with neurogenic bladder depending on the bladder emptying system used as compared to a population with no neurological impairment. To assess perception of urinary tract infection by patients with neurogenic bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An epidemiological and prospective study was conducted on 283 patients, in whom a total of 283 urethral cultures were performed. Of these, 106 came from patients with neurological damage, 28 from a control group with no neurological impairment, 74 from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital, and 75 from patients who attended the emergency room for symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. The sensitivity and specificity of patient perception as indicative of urinary tract infection was analyzed using ROC curves. RESULTS: Positive urethral cultures were found in 66% of patients with neurological damage and 25% of control patients. Within the neurological group, patients with the highest rates of positive urethral cultures were those with myelomeningocele (MMC) (81.5%) and spinal cord injuries (71.7%), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.01). The microorganism most commonly found in all subgroups was Escherichia coli, followed by Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the neurological subgroup, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis in the control subgroup, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus agalactiae in the emergency room subgroup. In the ICU subgroup, the most commonly found microorganism was Enterococcus faecalis, followed by Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sensitivity for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was 97.2%, as compared to 80% in the control group. Specificity was low in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the microorganism found in positive urethral cultures from all subgroups, except in the ICU group. The groups with the highest urinary tract infection rates were patients with MMC and spinal cord injuries. Sensitivity and specificity (as measured using ROC curves) for perception by neurological patients as an indication of the presence of urinary tract infection was higher in neurological patients than in the non-neurological control group (p=0.0004, area: 0.643).
TI  - Pathogenicity of Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis to brown tree frogs (Litoria ewingii).
AB  - Bacterial dermatosepticemia, a systemic infectious bacterial disease of frogs, can be caused by several opportunistic gram-negative bacterial species including Aeromonas hydrophila, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia liquifaciens. Here we determined the pathogenicity of 3 bacterial species (Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis) associated with an outbreak of fatal dermatosepticemia in New Zealand Litoria ewingii frogs. A bath challenge method was used to expose test frogs to individual bacterial species (2 x 10(7) cfu/mL in pond water); control frogs were exposed to uninfected pond water. None of the control frogs or those exposed to A. hydrophila or P. mirabilis showed any morbidity or mortality. Morbidity and mortality was 40% among frogs exposed to K. pneumonia, and the organism was reisolated from the hearts, spleens, and livers of affected animals.
TI  - Triblock copolymer matrix-based capillary electrophoretic microdevice for high-resolution multiplex pathogen detection.
AB  - Rapid and simple analysis for the multiple target pathogens is critical for patient management. CE-SSCP analysis on a microchip provides high speed, high sensitivity, and a portable genetic analysis platform in molecular diagnostic fields. The capability of separating ssDNA molecules in a capillary electrophoretic microchannel with high resolution is a critical issue to perform the precise interpretation in the electropherogram. In this study, we explored the potential of poly(ethyleneoxide)-poly(propyleneoxide)-poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblock copolymer as a sieving matrix for CE-SSCP analysis on a microdevice. To demonstrate the superior resolving power of PEO-PPO-PEO copolymers, 255-bp PCR amplicons obtained from 16S ribosomal RNA genes of four bacterial species, namely Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus ducreyi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis, were analyzed in the PEO-PPO-PEO matrix in comparison with 5% linear polyacrylamide and commercial GeneScan gel. Due to enhanced dynamic coating and sieving ability, PEO-PPO-PEO copolymer displayed fourfold enhancement of resolving power in the CE-SSCP to separate same-sized DNA molecules. Fivefold input of genomic DNA of P. aeruginosa and/or N. meningitidis produced proportionally increased corresponding amplicon peaks, enabling correct quantitative analysis in the pathogen detection. Besides the high-resolution sieving capability, a facile loading and replenishment of gel in the microchannel due to thermally reversible gelation property makes PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer an excellent matrix in the CE-SSCP analysis on the microdevice.
TI  - An assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using Lucilia sericata Meigen as the marker species.
AB  - The relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (ES) from two carrion-feeding insects, Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and Dermestes maculatus DeGeer, and a detritivore, Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, were compared to that of Lucilia sericata Meigen, a species with ES of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. Viable counts were used to assess time-kill of ES against five bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although T. molitor and D. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of P. mirabilis. The blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The larval ES from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of potency varied between the four species. These differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. Overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using L. sericata.
TI  - Extended Spectrum Beta-lactamase Detection in Gram-negative Bacilli of Nosocomial Origin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to third generation cephalosporins by acquisition and expression of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) enzymes among gram-negative bacilli is on a rise. The presence of ESBL producing organisms significantly affects the course and outcome of an infection and poses a challenge to infection management worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the period from June 2007 to 2008, we collected 1489 samples from patients suspected of nosocomial infection. The isolates were identified based on colony morphology and biochemical reaction. Gram negative bacilli resistant to third generation cephalosporins were tested for ESBL by double disc synergy test (DDST- a screening test)and then phenotypic confirmatory test. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: From the sample of 238 gram-negative bacilli, we isolated Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter cloacae. Following both methods, 34% isolates were ESBL-positive. The ESBL producing isolates were significantly resistant (p < 0.01) to ampicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin as compared to non-ESBL producers. Multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) higher (69.14%) in ESBL positive isolates than non-ESBL isolates (21.66%). CONCLUSION: High prevalence of ESBL in our hospital cannot be ignored. ESBL producers can be detected by DDST and phenotypic confirmatory test with equal efficacy. The sensitivity of screening test improved with the use of more than one antibiotic and addition of one or two antibiotics would not increase cost and labor. We recommend DDST using multiple antibiotics in all microbiology units as a routine screening test.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of chronic leg ulcers: current results compared with data  5 years ago in a specialized dermatology department.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In nearly every chronic wound different bacteria species can be detected. Nevertheless, the presence of such microorganisms is not necessarily obligatory associated with a delayed wound healing. But from this initially unproblematic colonization an infection up to a sepsis can arise in some patients. The aim of our clinical investigation was to analyse the spectrum of microbial colonization of patients with a chronic leg ulcer in our specialized dermatological outpatient wound clinic, and to compare them with the results of comparable data already collected 5 years ago. OBJECTIVES: In our retrospective investigation the results of bacteriological swabs were documented in 100 patients with a total of 107 chronic leg ulcers. All patients visited the specialized wound outpatient clinic, Department of Dermatology, University of Essen in Germany. METHODS: A total of 60 patients were female, 40 were male. The mean age was 65 years. Altogether a total of 191 bacterial isolates and 25 different bacterial species could be identified. RESULTS: The most often detected species were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 60), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 36) as well as Proteus mirabilis (n = 17). In 10 patients (10%) we identified a colonization with methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Merely in 6 patients the taken swabs were sterile. Five years ago a comparable investigation was already carried out in our wound outpatient clinic. At that time we could detect in particular more frequent MRSA (21.5% vs. 10%) and rarely P. aeruginosa (24.1% vs. 33.6%). CONCLUSION: The results of our investigation demonstrate the current spectrum of the bacterial colonization in patients with chronic leg ulcers in a university dermatological wound centre in comparison to the last 5 years. In our institution we were able to demonstrate a shift of the detected bacterial species from gram-positive in direction to gram-negative germs. Beside the already known problems with MRSA, in future therapeutic strategies in patients with chronic leg ulcers the increasing amount of gram-negative bacteria and especially of P. aeruginosa should considered.
TI  - Photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric UTIs.
AB  - AIMS: To test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. METHODS AND RESULTS: Toluidine blue (TB), methylene blue (MB), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical UTI-implicated pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm LED-illuminated conditions. TB and MB were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with the other compounds. Trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except Pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ALA required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. CONCLUSIONS: TB and MB were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. The photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.
TI  - Notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  - Anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. This could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. This study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and 65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. The floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.7%), Escherichia coli (1.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). Anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (Peptococcus 12.4% and Peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), Bacteroides (12.4%), Clostridium (3.8%), Fusobacterium (2.9%) and Propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. In 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only Aspergillus, in association with Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, was identified. The study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal properties of acetonic extract of Feijoa sellowiana  fruits and its effect on Helicobacter pylori growth.
AB  - Feijoa sellowiana Berg. fruit, widely used for human consumption, is well appreciated for its good nutritional characteristics and for its pleasant flavor and aroma. In a prior study we showed that the acetonic extract of F. sellowiana fruit exerts a potent antibacterial activity against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. To confirm and deepen the study on antimicrobial activities of the fruit, in this article we analyze the same extract for its effectiveness against different kind of bacteria both as American Type Culture Collection standard strains and clinically isolates, the Gram-negative Helicobacter pylori, and three fungal strains (one human pathogen and two phytopathogens). Our aim was also to isolate and define the active component(s) involved in the antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-H. pylori activity of the extract through activity-guided fractionation procedures. This allowed us to identify flavone as the active compound of F. sellowiana fruit. Flavone showed a high antibacterial activity against the nine standard bacterial strains tested and the matched clinically isolated bacterial strains and was significantly more active against H. pylori than metronidazole. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris from both standard and clinical sources showed a very high sensitivity to flavone (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] = 1.95 microg/mL for standard strains and 3.9 microg/mL for clinical isolates of the three bacteria), showing also good minimal bactericidal concentration values. Among fungi tested, Rhyzoctonia solani was the most sensitive strain to the action of flavone (MIC = 62.5 microg/mL).
TI  - [Etiological factors of community acquired urinary tract infections in hospitalized patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Etiological factors of community-acquired urinary tract infections  (UTI) are specific for age, gender, season, complication of UTI and type of UTI. Their prevalence and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents shows geographic and time variability. PURPOSE: To evaluate etiological characteristics of acute community-acquired UTI in hospitalised patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective-prospective study included 200 adult patients with community-acquired UTI who were, in view of the serious clinical picture and unsuccessful ambulatory treatment, hospitalised in the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Tuzla, for a period of two years (2006 and 2007). The data concerning the age, gender, season, complication of UTI and type of UTI were collected from the patient's records. Urine analysis was done following standard microbiological methods, and the antibiogram was done following standard disc-diffusion method on the Mueller-Hinton agar. WORK RESULTS: The dominant etiological factors of UTI were: E. coli (73.5%), Klebsiella spp. (8.5%), Proteus mirabilis (5.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%) and Enterococcus faecalis (3%). The predominant etiological factor of this UTI was E. coli (P < 0.0001). E. coli was significantly more frequent etiological factor of UTI in females (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the frequency between etiological factors of UTI for different age groups of patients (P = 0.173), or for different seasons (P > 0.05). All etiological factors are significantly more frequent during warmer periods of the year (P < 0.05). E. coli is a significantly more frequent etiological factor in complicated and non-complicated pyelonephrytis and cystourethritis (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference of frequency between etiological factors of prostatitis (P = 0.7163). By analyzing the susceptibility for antimicrobials, we found that E. coli has good susceptibility for Cephalosporins of the third generation, for Gentamycin, Nitrofurantoin, Norfloxacin, Ciprofloxacin and Pipemidin acid (susceptibility higher than 88.7%), Klebsiella spp. for Imipenem and Meropenem (susceptibility 100%), Proteus mirabilis for Imipenem (susceptibility 100%) and relatively for Amikacin (susceptibility 81.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa for Imipenem (susceptibility 100%) and for Meropenem (susceptibility 87.5%) and Enterococcus faecalis for Vancomycin (susceptibility 100%) and relatively for Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Doxicyclin and Nitrofurantoin (susceptibility 83.4%). CONCLUSION: Etiological characteristics of UTI are specific for different regions. Evaluation of these characteristics in our region is the basis for empirical antimicrobial therapy of UTI, which is necessary for a timely and successful treatment of UTI.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of NSAIDS on clinical isolates of urinary tract infection and diabetic foot infection.
AB  - Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are a group of chemically dissimilar agents that have primary effect of inhibition of prostaglandin's synthesis. Aspirin (Acetyl Salicylic Acid) is used as an analgesic, anti pyretic, anti-inflammatory agent and also have an anticoagulant effect. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is used as pain reliever. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Aspirin and Tylenol against clinical isolates of urinary tract infection (UTI) and diabetic foot infections. A total of 100 clinical isolates were analyzed. Out of these 50 were urine samples from diabetic patients with UTI and 50 pus samples from diabetic foot infection. Bacteriological study was done by inoculating urine samples on Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte deficient (CLED) media. Pus samples were inoculated on Blood agar and MacConkey's agar. Identification was done by colony characteristics, gram staining and standard biochemical tests and Quick Test Strip (QTS-20) DESTO Laboratories, Karachi. Antibacterial effect of Aspirin and Tylenol were tested against 100 clinical isolates by Replica plate method, Agar well diffusion method and tube dilution method. Concentrations of Aspirin and Tylenol (10 microg, 50 microg, 100 microg, 500 microg, 1000 microg) were made in Muller Hinton media. Bacteria isolated from urine samples were Escherichia coli 30%, Staphylococcus aureus 20%, Enterococcus faecalis 10%, S. saprophyticus 10%, Proteus spp. 6%, Pseudomonas spp. 6%, S. pyogenes 6%, S. agalactiae 6%, S. epidermidis 4%, and Klebsiella spp. 2%. Bacteria isolated from pus samples were S. aureus 30%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18%, S. epidermidis 14%, Klebsiella pneumonia 12%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, E. coli 10%, P. vulgaris 4%. Aspirin was effective at 100-500 microg concentration against all isolates. Tylenol has marked effect on pathogens at 100 microg concentration. Aspirin and Tylenol along with analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory properties also have marked anti bacterial effect on isolates from UTI and Diabetic foot infections and inhibits the growth of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and both can be used synergistically with antibiotics for effective treatment.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of four Ficus carica latex fractions against resistant human pathogens (antimicrobial activity of Ficus carica latex).
AB  - Methanolic, hexanoic, chloroformic and ethyl acetate extracts of Ficus carica latex were investigated for their in vitro antimicrobial proprieties against five bacteria species and seven strains of fungi. The green fruit latex was collected from Chott Mariam Souse, Middle East coast of Tunisia. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated and based respectively on the inhibition zone using the disc-diffusion assay, minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) for bacterial testing and the method by calculating inhibition percentage (I%) for fungi-inhibiting activities. The methanolic extract had no effect against bacteria except for Proteus mirabilis while the ethyl acetate extract had inhibition effect on the multiplication of five bacteria species (Enterococcus fecalis, Citobacter freundei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Echerchia coli and Proteus mirabilis). For the opportunist pathogenic yeasts, ethyl acetate and chlorophormic fractions showed a very strong inhibition (100%); methanolic fraction had a total inhibition against Candida albicans (100%) at a concentration of 500 microg/ml and a negative effect against Cryptococcus neoformans. Microsporum canis was strongly inhibited with methanolic extract (75%) and totally with ethyl acetate extract at a concentration of 750 microg/ml. Hexanoic extract showed medium results.
TI  - [Antimicrobial treatment of nosocomial intra-abdominal infections--new treatment  options with tygecycline].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial, intra-abdominal infections are extremely serious conditions, considering possibilities for their early diagnosis, as well as for their effective therapy. Multiresistant bacteria (Enterobacteriacae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases - ESBL Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE], and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) are frequently isolated as pathogens of these infections. Tygecycline is among the novel wide- spectrum antibiotics affecting multiresistant bacteria, which are being introduced in clinical practice. AIM: The aim of this study is to assess actual sensitivity of tygecycline to the commonest pathogens of intra-abdominal infections, generated in hospitalized surgical patients. Based on the sensitivity tests, tygecycline was indicated for targeted antibiotic therapy in intraabdominal infections. METHODS: Sensitivity to tygecycline, aminopenicillins, fluorochinoloni and gentamycine was established for the following bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonie, Enterobacter cloacea, Proteus mirabilis. Sensitivity to oxacillin, clincamycine and tygecycline was tested in Staphylococcus aureus, and to fluorochinolini, gentamycine and tygecycline in Enterococcus faecalis, and to fluorochinoloni, gentamycine, ceftazidime and gentamycine in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on the sensitivity results, tygecycline was administered in two patients with postsurgical intra-abdominal infections caused by ESBL Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonie. The initital dose of tygecycline was 100 mg i.v., followed by tygecycline 50 mg i.v. every 12 hours for 7 days. RESULTS: The isolated bacteria showed 98-100% sensitivity to tygecycline, except Psudomonas aeruginosa, where 100% resistance was demonstrated. Targeted antimicrobial medication with tygecycline proved effective in postoperative nosocomial intra-abdominal infections, the both concerned patients recovered. CONCLUSION: The choice of antimicrobial medication in nosocomial intra-abdominal infections requires through evaluation considering various factors including prior antibiotic therapy, co-morbidities and the current status of sensitivity with respect to potential multiresistant pathogens. Tygecycline shows significant in vitro efficacy against resistant gram-positive and key gram-negative facultative bacteria, which are a common cause of intra-abdominal infections in surgery patients. Clinical experience has shown that tygecycline is safe and effective in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates from the Chinese Meropenem Surveillance Study (CMSS), 2003-2008.
AB  - The Chinese Meropenem Surveillance Study (CMSS) programme was initiated in 2003 with the aim of monitoring the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli in China. From 2003 to 2008, a total of 3892 isolates were collected from 10 teaching hospitals. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 11 antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. During the study period, a marked decrease in the susceptibility of Acinetobacter spp. to meropenem and imipenem was noticed, from 94.6% to 60.7% and from 92.5% to 62.1%, respectively. However, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa the susceptibility was relatively stable, with susceptibility rates of 86.2% to 76.0% for meropenem and 74.8% to 70.5% for imipenem. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited the highest activities against enterobacterial organisms, with ranges of MIC(90) values (MIC for 90% of the organisms) from 0.064mg/L to 0.25mg/L and 0.25 to 4mg/L, respectively. Except for Acinetobacter spp., the next most active agent against the majority of isolates was amikacin, with susceptibility ranging from 78.8% to 93.3%, followed by piperacillin/tazobactam (73.7% to 98.2%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (63.9% to 99.1%), cefepime (67.0% to 95.4%) and ceftazidime (54.5% to 93.3%). The percentage of isolates positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus mirabilis ranged from 50.9% to 66.7%, 25.4% to 42.4% and 8.9% to 24.2%, respectively. These CMSS results have demonstrated increasing resistance of Acinetobacter spp. to carbapenems, resulting from the spread of highly resistant clones. Continued surveillance studies, including CMSS, as well as potent measures for controlling the spread of resistant clones are required.
TI  - Frequency of resistance and susceptible bacteria isolated from houseflies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we determine the vector competence of Musca domestica  with reference to the transmission of susceptible and resistance bacterial strains in hospitals and slaughter house in Sanandaj City, west Iran. METHODS: Totally 908 houseflies were collected to isolate bacteria from their external body based on standard procedures.Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar based on recommendations of CLSI (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards). RESULTS: From collected houseflies, 366 bacteria species were isolated. The most common isolated bacterium at hospitals was Klebsiella pneumoniae 43.3% (n= 90) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 37% (n= 77), while that of slaughterhouse was Proteus mirabilis. 29.1% (n= 46) followed by Citrobacter freundii 28.4% (n= 45). Among all the isolates from hospitals, cephalexin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and tetracycline, resistance rates were above 32.5% and gentamicin expressed the highest susceptibility among all the isolates from hospitals. It is worth to note that K. pneumoniae showed 61% and 44.5% resistance to cephalexin and chloramphenicol respectively. Similarly, all isolates from slaughterhouse were more than 28% and 30% resistant to cephalexin and chloramphenicol respectively. Surprisingly, among all the isolates, Citrobacter freundii were highly resistant to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: Houseflies collected from hospitals and slaughterhouse may be involved in the spread of drug resistant bacteria and may increase the potential of human exposure to drug resistant bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - The influence of omentectomy on bacterial clearance: an experimental study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The influence of an omentectomy on peritoneal defense mechanisms and  its clinical consequences have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of omentectomy on bacterial growth in blood and tissue specimen cultures in rats with experimental peritonitis. METHODS: Fifty Wistar-Albino rats were included in the present study. Animals were assigned into five groups as follow: Group 1 (n = 10), omentectomy alone; Group 2 (n = 10), omentectomy + bacterial peritonitis; Group 3 (n = 10), bacterial peritonitis alone; Group 4 (n = 10), laparotomy alone; and Group 5 (n = 10), sham group. Culture positivity rate and bacterial growth (colony forming units [CFU]/gram tissue) were assessed in mesenteric lymphoid tissue and venous blood of all animals. RESULTS: Bacterial growth in lymphoid tissue was significantly higher in Groups 2 and 3 than others (both, p < 0.05). CFU of Escherichia coli in lymphoid tissue was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Groups 1 and 3 (both, p < 0.05/4). Blood culture positivity was significantly higher in Group 2 than the others (both, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The omentum has an important role in the host peritoneal defense system. Peritoneal infection may pursue a more severe course with increased bacterial entrance into the blood in the absence of the omentum.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine and Tris-EDTA.
AB  - Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine 0.15% and Tris-EDTA (Otodine) were determined by broth microdilution for 150 isolates representing the most common pathogens associated with canine otitis. The microorganisms were classified into three groups according to their levels of susceptibility. The most susceptible group included Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Malassezia pachydermatis, Streptococcus canis and Corynebacterium auriscanis, which were generally killed by 1 : 64 dilution of the antiseptic product (MBC = 23/0.8 microg/mL of chlorhexidine/Tris-EDTA). The most resistant organism was Proteus mirabilis, which survived up to 1 : 8 dilution of the product (MBC = 375/12 microg/mL). Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus displayed intermediate MBCs ranging between 188/6 and 47/1.5 microg/mL. Interestingly, S. pseudintermedius was more susceptible than S. aureus, and no significant difference was observed between meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates within each species, indicating that antiseptic use is unlikely to co-select for meticillin resistance. Although the concentrations required for killing (MBCs) varied considerably with microorganism type, the combination of chlorhexidine 0.15% and Tris-EDTA was active against all the pathogens most commonly involved in canine otitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the stem bark of Saraca indica (Caesalpiniaceae).
AB  - Chloroform, methanol, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark of Saraca indica were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungi: Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus. Methanolic and aqueous extract exhibited antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 0.5-2% and 1-3% respectively. Methanolic extract exhibited the strongest activity against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - [Intracranial suppurations of otorhinolaryngological origin in children in Senegal].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracranial suppurations (ICSs) are poorly assessed in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study from 1st January 1996 to 31st December 2004 in children admitted to the pediatric department of the Hopital Principal de Dakar, Senegal, for a sinogenic or otitic ICS. All cases were diagnosed by CT scan. RESULTS: Sixteen children (12 boys and 4 girls), mean age of 11.2 years (range, 7-15 years), were admitted with the primary diagnosis of ICS. The mean time from the beginning of fever or neurological disorders to admission was 12 days (range, 1-60 days) and 6 days (range, 1-22 days), respectively. At admission, fever was noted in 14 patients and neurological signs in all patients. Otolaryngologic infections were sinusitis (n=14) or otitis (n=2). ICSs were subdural empyema (n=8), single (n=6) or multiple (n=1) cerebral abscesses, or association of subdural empyema and cerebral abscess (n=1). Bacteriological cultures were seldom positive because of frequent previous antibiotic therapies and showed Staphylococcus aureus (n=2), nongroupable Streptococcus (n=1), or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis (n=1). Antibiotics were given initially intravenously for 30 days, then orally for 30 days. Additionally, some patients received corticosteroids (n=4) or phenobarbitone (n=9). Aspiration drainage of the ICS was undertaken in 13 patients. All the children were cured, 4 of whom had neurological sequelae at follow-up. DISCUSSION: This pediatric series provides important data on the characteristics of ICS in sub-Saharan Africa. Therapeutic measures adapted to this context are proposed. CONCLUSION: Access to CT scan was fundamental in guiding medical and surgical management and ensuring a mostly favorable outcome despite long delays in treatment initiation.
TI  - Chronic suppurative otitis media in cleft palate: microorganism etiology and susceptibilities.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the microbial etiology of suppurative chronic otitis media (SCOM) in patients with complete cleft lip and palate and isolated cleft palate and to determine the sensitivity of isolated microorganisms to antibiotics by drug diffusion from impregnated discs in agar and the minimum inhibitory concentration of each drug to these microorganisms by drug dilution in agar. DESIGN/PATIENTS: Effusion samples of SCOM obtained from 40 patients with cleft lip and palate registered at the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies, University of Sao Paulo, at Bauru, Brazil, were bacteriologically analyzed by cultures. The isolated bacteria were submitted to an in vitro susceptibility test to clinically used drugs. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained in 100% of studied cases. Among the 57 strains observed, the most frequent were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (14%), and Proteus mirabilis (12%). The frequency of Gram-negative bacilli (enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative bacilli) was 67%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa presented the highest sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, and enterobacteriaceae exhibited the highest sensitivity to gentamicin. The strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis presented the highest sensitivity to imipenem and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with cleft lip and palate presenting with SCOM exhibited 100% positive cultures, with the highest frequency of Pseudomonas and enterobacteriaceae. With regard to the action of antibiotics, imipenem was effective against the four species of isolated microorganisms, followed by ciprofloxacin, which was effective against 75% of isolated species.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of some flavonoids.
AB  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of six plant-derived flavonoids representing two different structural groups were evaluated against standard strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and their drug-resistant isolates, as well as fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei) using the microdilution broth method. Herpes simplex virus Type-1 and Parainfluenza-3 virus were employed for antiviral assessment of the flavonoids using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. Ampicillin, gentamycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, acyclovir, and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. All tested compounds (32-128 microg/ml) showed strong antimicrobial and antifungal activities against isolated strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumanni, S. aureus, and C. krusei. Rutin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 5,7,3'-trihydroxy-flavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.2-0.05 microg/ml) were active against PI-3, while 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-[2''-O-(5'''-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-beta-D-apiofuranosyl] -beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.16-0.2 microg/ml) inhibited potently HSV-1.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of methanol extract of Ruta chalapensis (L), Quercus infectoria (Oliver) and Canthium parviflorum (Lam).
AB  - The present study aimed at evaluating the antibacterial activity of methanol extract of Ruta chalapensis, L., (Rutaceae), Quercus infectoria Oliver., (Fagaceae) and Canthium parviflorum Lam., (Rubiaceae) against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella oxytocoa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The experiment was carried out using disc diffusion method. The results revealed that the methanol extract of aerial parts of Ruta chalepensis (L) presented the highest zone of inhibition against tested pathogens. Other plants showed significant zone of inhibition.
TI  - Justification for the use of Ocimum gratissimum L in herbal medicine and its interaction with disc antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ethanolic extract of the leaves of Ocimium gratisimum L. (Lamiaceae), used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments such as urinary tract, wound, skin and gastrointestinal infections, was evaluated for its antibacterial properties against four clinical bacteria isolates namely: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the antifungal properties using a clinical isolate of Candida albicans. A typed bacterium of Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and another typed fungal strain of Candida albicans (ATCC 90028) were also included. The study also intended to verify if the concomitant administration of conventional antibiotics with Ocimium gratisimum which is normally taken as food (spice) will negatively affect its activity. METHODS: The agar diffusion method was used to test the in vitro activity of the plant extract. The interaction of the plant extract with some disc antibiotics namely: ciprofloxacin, septrin, streptomycin, ampicillin, nystatin and ketoconazole was tested using the agar overlay inoculum susceptibility disc method. Phytochemical analysis of the extract was performed following established methods. RESULTS: The extract showed good but varying in vitro activities against all the isolates tested. While ampicillin showed synergistic interaction with the plant extract against clinical isolates of E. coli and P. mirabilis, septrin was synergistic against the clinical isolate of E. coli only. Similarly, the activity of the extract against C. albicans isolate was synergistic with ketoconazole and nystatin. CONCLUSION: The study has validated the folkloric use of O. gratissimum in traditional medicinal practice and goes further to show that the use of this plant material as food spice may not really threaten the efficacy of some conventional antibiotics that may have been taken concomitantly with it as is the popular belief in the practice of herbal medicine in local/rural communities of many countries in the world.
TI  - Bacteriology of external ocular infections in Aba, South Eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. METHOD: The common isolates were studied in 298 bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. Isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. Each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: In decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), Staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae 26 (7.7 per cent), Streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), Escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), Neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), Streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), Moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), Proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and Neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). Bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). Bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). The age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. This was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. Bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). Conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. Blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. Diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. The bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. CONCLUSION: The study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - [Isolation and study of perspective probiotic strain of spore-forming bacteria from Bacillus genus].
AB  - AIM: To study physiologic, biochemical as well as antagonistic characteristics of isolated strain of Bacillus pumilus in comparison with known spore-forming bacteria from B. subtilis species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four strains of Bacillus spp. were used in the study: B. subtilis 3H, B. subtilis 534, B. subtilis 1719, B. pumilus isolated from the environment. The following strains from the collection of Tarasevich State Institute of Standardization and Control for Immunobiologicals were used for determining of antagonistic activity: Staphylococcus xylosus 25, Proteus mirabilis 24a, S. aureus "Nikiforov", S. aureus "Filippov", P. vulgaris 177, Shigella flexneri 337, Escherichia coil O111:H55, S. sonnei 170, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 9022, Candida albicans 690; clinical test-strains of yeast fungi: C. albicans (3 strains), C. haemuloni, C. tropicalis, Rhodotorula spp., Debaryomyces hansenii. RESULTS: Identification of isolated strain on combination of morphologic, tinctorial, cultural and biochemical characteristics showed that studied strain belonged to B. pumilus species. It did not have hemolytic and lecitinase activities, was resistant to several groups of antibiotics and had index of adhesion 1.76 +/- 2.5. In experiments in vivo the strain was non-toxic, non-toxigenic and avirulent. In preparations of isolated DNA, plasmids were not found. B. pumilus had high antagonistic effect against opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria as well as yeast fungi. Comparative assessment of tested strains from Bacillus genus showed that the isolated strain was not inferior than other representatives of spore-forming bacteria on spectrum and intensity of aforementioned characteristics. CONCLUSION: Low-adhesive, safe, plasmid-less strain of B. pumilus, which have intensive antagonistic properties, could be considered as a candidate for the development of new probiotic drugs for medical or veterinary use.
TI  - Use of quorum sensing antagonists to deter the formation of crystalline Proteus mirabilis biofilms.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis biofilms are a major cause of urinary catheter blockage. Antibiotic-impregnated catheters used to prevent catheter blockage have achieved limited success. Research has examined the efficacy of quorum sensing inhibitors against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, but there are few reports of the effects of these compounds against crystalline P. mirabilis biofilms. This study examined the effect of two quorum sensing antagonists, p-nitrophenyl glycerol (PNPG) and tannic acid, against crystalline P. mirabilis biofilms. Tannic acid and PNPG were observed to inhibit the quorum sensing system and the formation of P. mirabilis biofilms grown in artificial urine. The success of these compounds provides a possible means of preventing urinary catheter encrustation.
TI  - Crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  - The problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. These organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the pH of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. In this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary pH above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. Morganella morganii and Staphylococcus aureus elevated the pH of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the pH of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. The most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. This strategy raises the nucleation pH (pH(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. Increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a pH(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. It is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.
TI  - Are sinus-track cultures reliable for identifying the causative agent in chronic  osteomyelitis?
AB  - PURPOSE: The infection of bone that contains bone marrow called osteomyelitis, and is caused by different microorganisms. In this study, we aimed to determine the diagnostic value and accuracy of cultures of material from a sinus track compared with those of cultures of bone specimens that have been controversial. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Prospective study was conducted at Hospital University of Dicle, a 1,090-bed university-based hospital located in Diyarbakir, Turkey. Between May 2005 and September 2006, sinus-track cultures were compared with those of bone cultures from 43 patients with chronic osteomyelitis. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 30.6 +/- 3.6 years, and 29 (67%) male and 14 (33%) female. Organisms isolated from bone cultures were Staphylococcus 69% (29/42), Escherichia coli 9.5% (4/42), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 9.5% (4/42), Proteus mirabilis 7% (3/42), respectively. Cultures of sinus track and bone specimens gave identical results in 38% of patients. CONCLUSION: The value of bone culture in the therapy of osteomyelitis must be emphasized; it is the only reliable means of determining the responsible agent, up on which the antibiotic therapy is based. The correlation between sinus track and bone cultures was 38%, i.e., failure in the treatment for 6 patients out of 10.
TI  - Design and quality control of a pharmaceutical formulation containing natural products with antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant properties.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to determine the antibacterial and antifungal  activity as well as mutagenicity of Sechium edule fluid extract and to obtain a pharmaceutical formulation with them. The extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. isolated from clinical samples from two hospitals of Tucuman, Argentina. Non-toxicity and mutagenicity on both Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA 100 strains until 100 microg/plate were observed. A hydrogel with carbopol acrylic acid polymer containing S. edule fluid extract as antibacterial, antimycotic and antioxidant agent was obtained. Microbiological, physical and functional stability of pharmaceutical formulation conserved at room temperature for 1 year were determined. Addition of antioxidant preservatives to store the pharmaceutical formulation was not necessary. The semisolid system showed antimicrobial activity against all gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi assayed. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 20 to 800 microg/mL. Its activity was compared with a pharmaceutical formulation containing commercial antibiotic and antifungal. A pseudoplastic behavior and positive thixotropy were observed. Our current finding shows an antimicrobial activity of hydrogel containing S. edule extract on a large range of gram negative and gram positive multi-resistant bacteria and fungi. This topical formulation may be used as antimycotic and as antibacterial in cutaneous infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected plant species from "the Argentine Puna" against sensitive and multi-resistant bacteria.
AB  - AIM: The plant species reported here are traditionally used in the "Puna" or "Altiplano" of Argentina for ailments related to bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against a panel of sensitive and multi-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of tinctures and aqueous extracts (Baccharis boliviensis, Chiliotrichiopsis keidelii, Chuquiraga atacamensis, Fabiana bryoides, Fabiana densa, Fabiana punensis, Frankenia triandra, Parastrephia lucida, Parastrephia lepidophylla, Parastrephia phyliciformis, Tetraglochin cristatum) was determined using the agar macrodilution and broth microdilution methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS). The antibiotic resistant clinical strains were isolated from nosocomial infection in human lesions of skin and soft parts. RESULTS: The ethanolic extracts of 11 plant species inhibited the growth of one or more of the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethanol extracts (tinctures) of aerial parts of Baccharis, Fabiana and Parastrephia showed the highest levels of antibacterial activity on methicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin resistant Staphylococcus with MIC values from 20 to 150 microg/ml. Baccharis boliviensis and Fabiana bryoides were more active than the other plant species on Enterococcus faecalis with different phenotype. The most interesting activity on multi-resistant gram-negative strains was obtained from Chuquiraga atacamensis. Parastrephia species showed activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The ethanolic extracts exhibited stronger activity and broader spectrum of action than aqueous extracts. The extracts were bactericidal in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antibacterial activity in Puna plant extracts against multi-resistant bacteria give support to their traditional use for treating conditions associated with microorganisms in humans and animals and consequently seems promising for the treatment of multi-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - In vitro biological activity screening of Lycopodium complanatum L. ssp. chamaecyparissus (A. Br.) Doll.
AB  - This article reports the results of selected biological activities, including anticholinesterase, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties, of the petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol extracts as well as the alkaloid fraction of Lycopodium complanatum L. ssp. chamaecyparissus (A. Br.) Doll (LCC, Lycopodiaceae) growing in Turkey. Anticholinesterase effect of the extracts was tested against both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) at concentrations of 0.2 and 1 mg mL(-1) using microplate-reader assay based on Ellman method. Antioxidant activity of the LCC extracts was evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging method at 0.2 mg mL(-1) using microplate-reader assay. Both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of LCC exracts using Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney and Vero cell lines. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were screened against the bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis as well as the fungi: Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis. Only the petroleum ether extract of LCC possessed remarkable activity against both AChE and BChE at 1 mg mL(-1) (76.5 and 69.6%, respectively), whereas LCC extracts showed low free radical-scavenging activity. All of the extracts were found to be more effective against the ATCC strains than isolated ones, particularly S. aureus, while the extracts had moderate antifungal activity. On the other hand, we found that only the petroleum ether extract was active against HSV. In addition, we also analysed the content of the alkaloid fraction of the plant by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and identified lycopodine as the major alkaloid (60.8%).
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa Las quorum sensing autoinducer suppresses growth and biofilm production in Legionella species.
AB  - Bacteria commonly communicate with each other by a cell-to-cell signalling mechanism known as quorum sensing (QS). Recent studies have shown that the Las QS autoinducer N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C(12)-HSL) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa performs a variety of functions not only in intraspecies communication, but also in interspecies and interkingdom interactions. In this study, we report the effects of Pseudomonas 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL on the growth and suppression of virulence factors in other bacterial species that frequently co-exist with Ps. aeruginosa in nature. It was found that 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL, but not its analogues, suppressed the growth of Legionella pneumophila in a dose-dependent manner. However, 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL did not exhibit a growth-suppressive effect on Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Alcaligenes faecalis and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. A concentration of 50 microM 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL completely inhibited the growth of L. pneumophila. Additionally, a significant suppression of biofilm formation was demonstrated in L. pneumophila exposed to 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL. Our results suggest that the Pseudomonas QS autoinducer 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL exerts both bacteriostatic and virulence factor-suppressive activities on L. pneumophila alone.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Surveillance of intrahospital infections at the clinic for gynaecology and obstetrics.
AB  - Intrahospital infections (IHI) and antibiotics resistance are the problems which  exist in virtually all hospitals in the world. The main aim of the present research is establishing of epidemiological surveillance over occurrence of IHI at the Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the University Clinical Center Tuzla and thus identifies: types of bacteria which cause IHI, types of infection according to anatomical localization and research resistance organisms causing of IHI on antimicrobial drugs. A study was implemented on all patients admitted to Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics during the period of one year and who subsequently developed infection. Determination of intrahospital infections was done according to criteria defined by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention from the United States. The results of our work have shown that both urinary tract infections and surgical site infections are the most frequent. As IHI causers the most found are gram-negative organisms (73,7%), such as Escherichia coli (29,8%), right after that Klebsiella pneumoniae (24,6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and Proteus mirabilis (5,3%) (p<0,05). Gram-positive organisms as causers of IHI are registered in 26,3% cases. Out of that Streptococcus species are isolated in 10,5% cases, Staphylococcus aureus (8,8%) and coagulasa negative staphylococci (7%) (p>0,05). High percent resistance of bacteria was evident to beta-lactams, aminoglycosids and cephalosporin's of third generation. Gram-positive organisms were 100% sensitive to vancomycin, while gram-negative organisms manifested the high percent of sensibility to imipenem and cefepime.
TI  - Catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  - Urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the Institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, Centre for paraplegia of the Clinical Centre of the University of Sarajevo, were included. The patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: Group A (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; Group B (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; Group C (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. From a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. More than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. The overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. Infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. The vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by Gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. Providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by Proteus mirabilis (16,3%), Escherichia coli (11,8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), Morganella morgani (5,4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), Providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were Gram-positive with Enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among Acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), Providencia rettgeri (86,7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85,4%), Providencia stuarti (84,3%) and Morganella morgani (81,0%). Lower rates of resistance were found in Group C, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. Eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. Significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. The analysis of Group C showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two Groups of patients. The objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. In addition, possible correlations between UTI and the type of bladder management were examined.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of crude extract of Aloe barbadensis to clinically isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Aloe barbadensis was tested on clinically isolated  bacterial pathogens i.e. Enterococcus bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae causing infection in human being. Ethanolic and aqueous extracts were used for the antibacterial effect, which was measured by the appearance of zone of inhibition. Relatively higher MIC concentrations were obtained for gram negative bacteria E. coli and K. pneumoniae, with ethanol extract; however, no inhibitory effect was noted for aqueous extract. Ethanolic extract possesses great inhibitory activity for gram positive bacteria, E. bovis followed by S. aureus. Among gram negative bacteria, highest inhibitory effect was observed with P. aeruginosa, followed by M. morganii, P. mirabilis, and P. vulgaris, which was significant (p < 0.01) than E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Antimicrobial activity tests of crude extract of A. barbadensis were carried out to validate the use of traditional medicinal herbal and results of this study tend to give credence to the common use of A. barbadensis gel and leaf.
TI  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of fruit and leaf crude extracts of Momordica charantia: a Tanzania medicinal plant.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Momordica charantia extracts on reference strains and microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. METHOD: Petroleum ether and methanolic crude extracts of fruits and leaves of the plant were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the disk diffusion method on four reference microorganisms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus; and four clinical strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhi and Cryptococcus neoformans. RESULT: Antimicrobial activity was observed against all the tested microorganisms with exception to P. mirabilis and C. neoformans. Methanolic crude extracts exhibited relatively broader antimicrobial spectrum of activity than petroleum ether extracts with the as lower concentration as 0.075mg/microl. Methanolic fruit crude extract displayed the broadest antimicrobial spectrum by inhibiting majority (75%) of the tested microorganisms. Neither was there synergistic nor addition effect upon mixing leaf and fruit extracts of equal concentrations derived from the same solvent. CONCLUSION: Extracts of M.charantia demonstrated antimicrobial activity on tested microorganisms except on Proteus mirabilis and Cryptococcus neoformans. Fruit extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity than leaf extract. Further studies are recommended that will involve various parts of the plant, select different fractions of extracts and purify the active antimicrobial components.
TI  - 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), we used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis. PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples from patients with suspected UTI (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Acinobacter, Pr. mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Streptococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003 and 2006. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. All urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. Based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of E. coli, 92% (101/110) of K. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of P. aeruginosa and eight of 10 Pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with NMR (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). The remaining samples were sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The NMR method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the common uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis by NMR spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance analysis of bacteria in different wound infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the distribution and drug resistance of bacteria in different wound infections and provide evidence for wound infection control in subtropical regions. METHODS: This study involved 265 patients from 4 different departments of our hospital who experienced wound infections between July, 2007 and July, 2008. The bacterial strain distribution in the wounds and drug resistance of the bacteria were analyzed. RESULTS: Acinetobacter baumanii (39% of the total strain identified) was the most frequent bacterial strain causing infection of the burn wounds, followed by Proteus mirabilis (20%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). E. coli infection was prevalent in the departments of general surgery (37%) and urinary surgery (64%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas pneumonia infections were detected at the rate of 30% and 43% in the urinary surgery department, respectively. Different bacterial strains were found at similar rates around 10% in the wounds of patients undergoing traumatic surgery. CONCLUSION: Despite that the commonly seen pathogenic bacteria in burn patients including Staphylococcus aureus have been effectively controlled by early application of antibiotics, the opportunistic pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Proteus mirabilis often survive these antibiotics, and some strains evolve to be drug-resistant and even multi-drug-resistant. E. coli infection is prevalent in general surgery and urinary surgery departments, where Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can also be found frequently. All kinds of bacteria infection are present in trauma surgery department, each found at the rate around 10%.
TI  - Isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aerial parts of Thymus kotschyanus Boiss. and Hohen. (Lamiaceae) and flower buds of Dianthus caryophyllus L. (Caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: Two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. The isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thymol MIC values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and B. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a MIC value of 15.6 microg/ml. Eugenol achieved stronger MIC values against most tested pathogens and the best MIC value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and K. pneumoniae whereas, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and E. coli were inhibited with a MIC value of 31.2 microg/ml. Combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against P. mirabilis and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of two antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.
TI  - Changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study period. METHODS: Microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (10.9%), Enterococcus sp. (9.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), Acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), Proteus mirabilis (2%) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). Susceptibility of S. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. Not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. Increases in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). Results for methicillin-resistant CNS (MRCNS) show an even greater increase. P. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). Susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. S. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. Acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. Imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and P. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. CONCLUSION: In-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. Our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. STUDY OBJECT AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035, and fungus Candida albicans ATCC 60193. Microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)--the highest dilution of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. RESULTS: Concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (P>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (P>0.05). Spore-forming Bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and Bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Sensitivity of fungus Candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as Bacillus subtilis. Encapsulated bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria (P<0.05), gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (P<0.05), spore-forming Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus bacteria (P<0.05), and fungus Candida albicans (P<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and Candida fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. They could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
TI  - A blaVEB-1 variant, blaVEB-6, associated with repeated elements in a complex genetic structure.
AB  - bla(VEB-6) was found on the Proteus mirabilis chromosome in a context similar to  those of bla(VEB-1a) and bla(VEB-1b), in a truncated gene cassette flanked by 135-bp elements and duplications of the 3'-conserved segment of class 1 integrons. A linked aacA4-aadB-dfrA1-orfC cassette array includes components of Tn1331, illustrating the complex mosaicism of multiresistance regions.
TI  - Discovery of novel 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives as anti-gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  - A number of 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives were synthesized and examined for growth inhibition of several kinds of bacteria. 2',3',4'-Trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone itself exhibited no antibacterial activity, but some of its derivatives showed various antibacterial activities depending on functional groups introduced on the 2-phenyl ring. Eighteen out of 24 compounds synthesized in this study appeared to possess antibacterial activities against at least two Gram-positive strains of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2',3',4'-trihydroxyacetophenone being the most active with LC(50) of 5.8 muM and 5.6 muM respectively. However, none of the synthesized compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on Gram-negative strains, such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica, suggesting that anti-Gram-positive specificity of the antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Large scale multiplex PCR improves pathogen detection by DNA microarrays.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medium density DNA microchips that carry a collection of probes for a broad spectrum of pathogens, have the potential to be powerful tools for simultaneous species identification, detection of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance determinants. However, their widespread use in microbiological diagnostics is limited by the problem of low pathogen numbers in clinical specimens revealing relatively low amounts of pathogen DNA. RESULTS: To increase the detection power of a fluorescence-based prototype-microarray designed to identify pathogenic microorganisms involved in sepsis, we propose a large scale multiplex PCR (LSplex PCR) for amplification of several dozens of gene-segments of 9 pathogenic species. This protocol employs a large set of primer pairs, potentially able to amplify 800 different gene segments that correspond to the capture probes spotted on the microarray. The LSplex protocol is shown to selectively amplify only the gene segments corresponding to the specific pathogen present in the analyte. Application of LSplex increases the microarray detection of target templates by a factor of 100 to 1000. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a proof of principle for the improvement of detection of pathogen DNA by microarray hybridization by using LSplex PCR.
TI  - Comparison of solid-phase cytometry and the plate count method for the evaluation of the survival of bacteria in pharmaceutical oils.
AB  - AIM: To compare the survival of four bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in pharmaceutical oils, including jojoba oil/tea tree oil, carbol oil, jojoba oil and sesame oil. METHODS AND RESULTS: Oils were spiked with the test bacteria in a concentration of 10(4) CFU ml(-1). Bacteria were extracted from oils with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. Aliquots of the pooled water layers were analysed by solid-phase cytometry and plate counting. Plate counts dropped to zero for all test strains exposed for 24 h to three of the four oils. In contrast, significant numbers of viable cells were still detected by SPC, except in the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture and partly in sesame oil. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of bacteria for 24 h to the two oils containing an antimicrobial led to a loss of their culturability but not necessarily of their viability. The antibacterial activity of the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture supersedes that of carbol oil. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These in vitro data suggest that the jojoba oil/tea tree oil mixture more than carbol oil inhibits bacterial proliferation when used for intermittent self-catherization.
TI  - Microbial burden of some herbal antimalarials marketed at Elele, Rivers State.
AB  - Herbal antimalarials still remain an alternative to our traditional communities who can not afford orthodox antimalarials. This study was aimed at investigating the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological methods. Of the six preparations analyzed, "schnapps", palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water base preparations recorded higher microbial load. The mean microbial load was 159.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and 217.4 x 10(2)cfu/ml in water and alcohol base preparations respectively. The microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps base preparations were predominantly contaminated with Bacillus sp (Aerobic spore bearers) and Mucor spp. The palm wine preparation harboured Bacillus sp, yeasts and Mucor spp while the water base preparations had several isolates such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli 0157H7, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus feacalis, Serratia marcensces, Staph. aureus, Bacillus spp and Mucor spp. Conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as Ecoli O157H7, Ps aeruginosa, Stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of pomegranate rind extracts: enhancement by addition of metal salts and vitamin C.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Punica granatum L. or pomegranates, have been reported to have antimicrobial activity against a range of Gram positive and negative bacteria. Pomegranate formulations containing ferrous salts have enhanced although short-term, antibacteriophage activities which are rapidly diminished owing to instability of the ferrous combination. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activities of combinations of pomegranate rind extracts (PRE) with a range of metals salts with the added stabiliser vitamin C. METHODS: PRE solutions, prepared by blending rind sections with distilled water prior to sterilisation by autoclaving or filtration, were screened with a disc diffusion assay using penicillin G as a control. Suspension assays were used to determine the antimicrobial activities of PRE alone and in combination with salts of the following metals; Fe (II), Cu (II), Mn (II) or Zn (II), and vitamin C, against a panel of microbes following exposure for 30 mins. The test organisms included Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The screening assay demonstrated that PRE exhibited activity against the Gram positive organisms at 24 h with no observable effect on any of the Gram negative bacteria. However, after 12 h, zones of inhibition were only observed for Ps. aeruginosa. In contrast, using the suspension assay, addition of Cu (II) salts to PRE solutions extended the activities resulting in no detectable growth being observed for the PRE/Cu (II) combination against E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Minimal antimicrobial activity was observed following incubation with Fe (II), Mn (II) or Zn (II) salts alone or in combination with PRE against any of the organisms in the test panel. The addition of vitamin C markedly enhanced the activities of both PRE/Fe (II) and PRE/Cu (II) combinations against S. aureus. CONCLUSION: This is the first report demonstrating the enhanced efficacy of PRE/metal salt combinations in the presence of the stabilising agent vitamin C, to which all isolates were sensitive with the exception of B. subtilis. This study has validated the exploration of PRE along with additives such as metal salts and vitamin C as novel antimicrobial combinations.
TI  - A fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  - It is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. These structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. When added exogenously to P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nM, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. This molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast Candida albicans. Active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
TI  - [Fluoroquinolones and Gram-negative bacteria: antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of resistance].
AB  - Fluoroquinolones acts by interacting with type II topoisomerases (DNA gyrase and  topoisomerases IV). Related to this mechanism of action, bacteria have developed resistance mechanisms consisting in some target mutations (GyrA/GyrB for DNA gyrase and ParC/ParE for topoisomerase IV) or in a reduced access to the target itself, by either decreased permeability or augmented expression of efflux pumps, such as AcrAB and MexAB. Along with these classical mechanisms of chromosomal resistance, the presence of fluoroquinolones resistant proteins (Qnr) has been recently evidenced, codified by transmissible genes by means of plasmids, especially in Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas Proteus mirabilis and non fermenter Gram-negative, like Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are not involved in such a kind of resistance. Qnr proteins determine a slight increase in MIC values, which often remains below the susceptibility breakpoint. More relevant is their impact on MPC values. Additionally, new specific resistance mechanisms have been described. AAC(6')-Ib-cr represents the first enzyme able to inactivate, by acetylation, antimicrobials of two different classes, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. However, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, but not levofloxacin, are susceptible to this enzyme action. Finally, the presence of another resistance mechanism has been reported, an efflux-pump plasmid-mediated, codified by the QepA gene, which acts by a selective mechanism. Only hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, i.e. norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, but not all the other ones, i.e. levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, etc, are affected by this mechanism. In the light of these new information, it is clear that, in terms of bacterial resistance, it is not any more possible to assimilate one fluoroquinolones to another, since different molecules can be diversely active, due to the specific resistance mechanism.
TI  - Chitosan acetate bandage as a topical antimicrobial dressing for infected burns.
AB  - An engineered chitosan acetate bandage preparation (HemCon) is used as a hemostatic dressing, and its chemical structure suggests that it should also be antimicrobial. We previously showed that when a chitosan acetate bandage was applied to full-thickness excisional wounds in mice that had been infected with pathogenic bioluminescent bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus), it was able to rapidly kill the bacteria and save the mice from developing fatal infections. Wound healing was also stimulated. In the present study, we asked whether a chitosan acetate bandage could act as a topical antimicrobial dressing when it was applied to third-degree burns in mice contaminated with two of these bacterial species (P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis). Preliminary experiments established the length of burn time and the number of bacteria needed to produce fatal infections in untreated mice and established that the chitosan acetate bandage could adhere to the infected burn for up to 21 days. In the case of P. aeruginosa infections, the survival rate of mice treated with the chitosan acetate bandage was 73.3% (whereas the survival rate of mice treated with a nanocrystalline silver dressing was 27.3% [P = 0.0055] and that of untreated mice was 13.3% [P < 0.0002]). For P. mirabilis infections, the comparable survival rates were 66.7%, 62.5%, and 23.1% respectively. Quantitative bioluminescent signals showed that the chitosan acetate bandage effectively controlled the growth of bacteria in the burn and prevented the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. These data suggest that chitosan acetate bandage is efficacious in preventing fatal burn infections.
TI  - Uropathogens and host characteristics.
AB  - Uropathogens other than Escherichia coli occur with greater frequency in patients with risk factors for urinary tract infection (UTI). However, little is known about associations between uropathogen species and host characteristics. Three hundred nineteen urine specimens containing a balanced distribution of uropathogen species were selected from inpatients and outpatients at a university hospital clinical microbiology laboratory. Information on host characteristics was retrospectively collected by chart review. Differences in the frequencies of host characteristics in UTI groups, as defined by the causative uropathogen, were compared by chi-square/Fisher analysis. Multivariate classification and regression tree analysis were used to identify host characteristic subsets that distinguish among uropathogen groups. In this exploratory study, several uropathogen species were found to be strongly linked to host characteristics relevant to UTI. Patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa UTIs were more likely to have undergone urinary tract procedures (43% versus 15% overall), to have a neurogenic bladder (29% versus 12% overall), to have received recent antibiotic therapy (52% versus 24% overall), and to be male (76% versus 28% overall). Patients with Proteus mirabilis UTIs were more likely to have a foreign body in the lower urinary tract (48% versus 30% overall). The classification tree identified males over the age of 27 years who had undergone a prior urinary tract procedure as belonging to a host characteristic profile associated with P. aeruginosa UTI: 38% of patients with P. aeruginosa UTIs fit this profile. These data may be useful for planning future targeted prophylaxis studies.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fruits of Iranian Torilis leptophylla against some  clinical pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity of the methanolic extract of Torilis leptophylla was tested on eleven bacteria (Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis, Brucella melitensis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Bordetella bronshiseptica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Tested extract was effective against all bacteria but not B. subtilis. Consequently, the ethanolic extract had antibacterial activity on some pathogens thus confirming their use in folk medicine.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the formation of crystalline biofilms by mixed communities of urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - The crystalline bacterial biofilms that encrust Foley catheters compromise the care of many elderly and disabled patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether the biocide triclosan can prevent encrustation by the mixed flora of uropathogens that commonly infect patients undergoing long-term catheterization. Models of the catheterized bladder were inoculated with communities of organisms isolated from patients who were experiencing catheter blockage. The catheter retention balloons were inflated with water or triclosan (3 g triclosan l(-1) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate) and urine was supplied to the models for up to 7 days. The effect of triclosan was recorded on the viable cell populations, the pH of the residual urine and the times that catheters took to block. The extent of encrustation of the catheters was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. In models inoculated with communities containing Proteus mirabilis, triclosan prevented the rise in urinary pH that drives crystalline biofilm formation and catheter blockage. The biocide had no effect on populations of Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were eliminated from the residual urine and the catheters drained freely for the 7-day experimental period. In models inoculated with a mixed community containing Providencia rettgeri, catheters inflated with triclosan continued to block rapidly. Although K. pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris were eliminated from the residual urine, there was no effect on the viability of Providencia rettgeri. The results indicate that the triclosan strategy should be limited to the treatment of patients who are infected with Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of fish mucus from Channa punctatus and Cirrhinus mrigala.
AB  - Extracts and preparations made from the animal origin were used extensively in folk and modern medicine for treating many human diseases. In the present study efforts have been made to find the antimicrobial effect of the mucus of two bottom dwelling fresh water fishes namely, Channa punctatus and Cirrhinus mrigala. Fish mucus were tested against ten pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio cholera. The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition in mm. The mucus collected from Cirrhinus mrigala shows a strong inhibiting activity than the mucus of Channa punctatus.
TI  - Synthesis of some novel imidazole-based dicationic carbazolophanes as potential antibacterials.
AB  - Synthesis of fluorescent imidazole-based dicationic carbazolophanes incorporating various spacer units is described. Interestingly, the cyclophanes 2a and 5a incorporating a pyridine moiety exhibited superior antibacterial activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria in the tested concentrations as compared to the other cyclophanes as well as the test control, benzalkonium chloride (BAC), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and tetracycline.
TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Activity of d Metal Complexes of some 2-Substituted-1H-Benzimidazoles.
AB  - The metal complexes of nine 2-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles (I-IX) with Ni(II), Pd(II), Cu(II), Ag(I), Zn(II) salts were synthesized. The compounds were characterized by melting point, analytical data, IR spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by the disk diffusion method in Mueller-Hinton Agar on Staphylococcus aureusATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Cu(II)and Ag(I)complexes of II, III and IV showed considerable activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, S. typhi, Sh. flexneri and C. albicans microorganisms, the ligands themselves having no effect.
TI  - Some observations on the migration of Proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over foley catheters.
AB  - The ability of uropathogens to migrate along external surfaces of silicone Foley  catheters was examined. Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most motile organisms. P. aeruginosa migrated over both triclosan-impregnated and nitrofurazone-impregnated catheters, but these antibacterials inhibited the migration of P. mirabilis.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and electrochemistry of 4'-functionalized 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine ruthenium(II) complexes and their biological activity.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of Ru(II) terpyridine complexes derived from 4'-functionalized 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine ligands by a multi step procedure have been described. The complexes are redox-active, showing both metal-centred (oxidation) and ligand-centred (reduction) processes. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the synthesized ruthenium(II) complexes [Ru(attpy)2](PF6)2 (attpy = 4'-(4-acryloyloxymethylphenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine); [Ru(mttpy)2](PF6)2 (mttpy = 4'-(4-methacryloyloxymethylphenyl)-2,2':6',2''- terpyridine); [Ru(mttpy)(MeOPhttpy)](PF6)2 (MeOPhttpy = 4'-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine); and [Ru(mttpy)(ttpy)](PF6)2 (ttpy = 4'-(4-methylphenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine) were tested against four human pathogens (Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and five plant pathogens (Curvularia lunata, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium udum, Macrophomina phaseolina and Rhizoctonia solani) by the well diffusion method and MIC values of the complexes are reported. A biological study of the complexes indicated that the complexes [Ru(mttpy)2](PF6)2 and [Ru(mttpy)(MeOPhttpy)](PF6)2 exhibit very good activity against most of the test pathogens and their activity is better than those of some of the commercially available antibiotics like tetracycline and the fungicide carbendazim.
TI  - Kinetic study approach of remazol black-B use for the development of two-stage anoxic-oxic reactor for decolorization/biodegradation of azo dyes by activated bacterial consortium.
AB  - The laboratory-isolated strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhodobacter sphaeroides,  Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus circulance, NAD 1 and NAD 6 were observed to be predominant in the bacterial consortium responsible for effective decolorization of the azo dyes. The kinetic characteristics of azo dye decolorization by bacterial consortium were determined quantitatively using reactive vinyl sulfonated diazo dye, remazol black-B (RB-B) as a model substrate. Effects of substrate (RB-B) concentration as well as different substrates (azo dyes), environmental parameters (temperature and pH), glucose and other electron donor/co-substrate on the rate of decolorization were investigated to reveal the key factor that determines the performance of dye decolorization. The activation energy (E(a)) and frequency factor (K(0)) based on the Arrhenius equation was calculated as 11.67 kcal mol(-1) and 1.57 x 10(7)mg lg MLSS(-1)h(-1), respectively. The Double-reciprocal or Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to evaluate V(max), 15.97 h(-1) and K(m), 85.66 mg l(-1). The two-stage anoxic-oxic reactor system has proved to be successful in achieving significant decolorization and degradation of azo dyes by specific developed bacterial consortium with a removal of 84% color and 80% COD for real textile effluents vis-a-vis >or=90% color and COD removal for synthetic dye solution.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic performance of tigecycline versus common intravenous antibiotics  for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In clinical trials tigecycline was similar to vancomycin/aztreonam for complicated skin and skin structure infections, but data comparing it with other widely used antibiotics are lacking. We predicted the pharmacodynamic cumulative fraction of response (CFR) of tigecycline against bacteria implicated in complicated skin and skin structure infections and compared it with the CFRs for piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and imipenem/cilastatin. METHODS: A 5,000-patient Monte Carlo simulation using a two-compartment intravenous infusion model was used to simulate steady-state concentrations for common dosages of these antibiotics. Population pharmacokinetics data from infected patients were employed. The CFR was calculated against Staphylococcus aureus (42% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]), streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from worldwide surveillance (TEST and SENTRY) and weighted by prevalence of involvement in complicated skin and skin structure infections. RESULTS: Excluding MRSA, the weighted CFR was greatest for imipenem/cilastatin and piperacillin/tazobactam regimens (93.9%-95.9%). With 42% MRSA added to the model, only tigecycline monotherapy achieved a high CFR (88.2%). The addition of vancomycin raised the CFR to 91.0%, 89.5%, 88.3%, 82.9%, and 78% for imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q6h, imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q8h, piperacillin/tazobactam, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone regimens, respectively. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline monotherapy had a likelihood of achieving its requisite pharmacodynamic exposure similar to that of combinations of piperacillin/tazobactam or imipenem/cilastatin plus vancomycin for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in Taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  - A horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (RCWs) in Taiwan. Some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB), were identified. Pulsotypes of ESBL-producing P. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The prevalences of MRSA, ESBL-producing E. coli (K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) P. aeruginosa, MDR-PA, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and MDR-AB were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0% and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. Among the 44 respiratory isolates of P. mirabilis with an ESBL phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. Among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). High prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in RCWs.
TI  - [Etiology of urinary tract infections and antimicrobial susceptibility of urinary pathogens].
AB  - With the objective of knowing the common etiological agents in urinary infection  and comparing its antimicrobial susceptibility in nosocomial and community-acquired urinary infections, we analyse all the urine bacteriological exams from the Servico de Patologia Clinica do Centro Hospitalar do Nordeste, EPE - Unidade Hospitalar de Braganca, during a two years period (April 2004 to March 2006). During this period, 4018 urine bacteriological exams were made. The cultural exam was positive in 572 samples (144 from nosocomial infections and 428 from community-acquired urinary infections). The Escherichia coli was the more isolated strain (68,4 %), followed by Klebsiella spp (7,9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6,1%) and Proteus mirabilis (5,2%). Concerning to antimicrobial susceptibility, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp showed a high resistance to the antimicrobials Amoxicillin, Piperacillin, Cephalothin, Ceftazidim and Quinolones. For Enterobacteriaceae Imipenem, Amikacin and Netilmicin were the antimicrobials with more level of susceptibility. Imipenem and Amikacin were the more efficient antimicrobials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Concerning to the susceptibility for the same etiological agent, in nosocomial and community-acquired urinary infections, we founded statistical significant differences in the antimicrobials Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and Collistin for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in the group of antimicrobials from Quinolones for the Proteus mirabilis. In the other identified agents there were no statistical significant differences for antimicrobials. This study it allows making use of data necessary for the knowledge of etiologic urinary infection agents in Braganca and provides the information about the antimicrobials resistance, which were necessary to initiate an adequate empirical treatment and to elaborate treatment guides.
TI  - Identification of an inhibitor of the MurC enzyme, which catalyzes an essential step in the peptidoglycan precursor synthesis pathway.
AB  - The pathway for synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide is essential in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This pathway has been exploited in the recent past to identify potential new antibiotics as inhibitors of one or more of the Mur enzymes. In the present study, a high-throughput screen was employed to identify potential inhibitors of the Escherichia coli MurC (UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid:L-alanine ligase), the first of four paralogous amino acid-adding enzymes. Inhibition of ATP consumed during the MurC reaction, using an adaptation of a kinase assay format, identified a number of potential inhibitory chemotypes. After nonspecific inhibition testing and chemical attractiveness were assessed, C-1 emerged as a compound for further characterization. The inhibition of MurC by this compound was confirmed in both a kinetic-coupled enzyme assay and a direct nuclear magnetic resonance product detection assay. C-1 was found to be a low micromolar inhibitor of the E. coli MurC reaction, with preferential inhibition by one of two enantiomeric forms. Experiments indicated that it was a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to the MurC enzyme. Further work with MurC enzymes from several bacterial sources revealed that while the compound was equally effective at inhibiting MurC from genera (Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) closely related to E. coli, MurC enzymes from more distant Gram-negative species such as Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baylyi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not inhibited.
TI  - Viper metalloproteinase (Agkistrodon halys pallas) with antimicrobial activity against multi-drug resistant human pathogens.
AB  - Metalloproteinases are abundant enzymes in crotalidae and viperidae snake venoms. Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) comprise a family of zinc-dependent enzymes, which display many different biological activities. A 23.1 kDa protein was isolated from Agkistrodon halys (pallas, Chinese viper) snake venom. The toxin is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 23146.61 and an N-terminal sequence (MIQVLLVTICLAVFPYQGSSIILES) relatively similar to that of other metalloprotein-like proteases isolated from the snake venoms of the Viperidae family. The antibacterial effect of Agkistrodon halys metalloproteinase (AHM) on Burkholderia pseudomallei (strains TES and KHW), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacterium) was studied at a concentration 120 microM. Interestingly, we found that the metalloproteinase exhibited antibacterial properties and was more active against S. aureus, P. vulgaris, P. mirabilis and multi-drug resistant B. pseudomallei (strain KHW) bacteria. AHM variants with high bacteriostatic activity (MIC 1.875-60 microM) also tended to be less cytotoxic against U-937 human monocytic cells up to 1 mM concentrations. These results suggest that this metalloprotein exerts its antimicrobial effect by altering membrane packing and inhibiting mechanosensitive targets.
TI  - Performance of chromID ESBL, a chromogenic medium for detection of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - The chromogenic agar medium chromID ESBL (bioMerieux) was compared with BLSE agar medium (AES) for selective isolation and presumptive identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae from clinical samples. A total of 765 samples (468 rectal swabs, 255 urine samples and 42 pulmonary aspirations) obtained from 547 patients was processed. All bacterial strains isolated on either medium were further characterized using biochemical tests, and ESBL producers were confirmed by synergy testing. Genetic characterization of ESBL genes was determined by PCR. A total of 33 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains [Escherichia coli (n=16), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=8), Enterobacter spp. (n=3), Citrobacter spp. (n=5) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1)] was recovered. The sensitivity after 24 h incubation was 88 % for chromID ESBL and 85 % for BLSE agar. At 48 h, the sensitivity of chromID ESBL increased to 94 % and was higher than that obtained with BLSE agar. The positive predictive value at 24 h for chromID ESBL was 38.7 % [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 28.3 -50.2 %)], which was significantly higher than that for BLSE agar [15.4 %, 95 % CI 10.1 -21.5 %]. On both media, false-positive results were mostly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to Enterobacteriaceae overproducing chromosomal cephalosporinase (Enterobacter spp.) or a chromosomal penicillinase (Klebsiella oxytoca). This study showed that chromID ESBL, a ready-to-use chromogenic selective medium, is sensitive and specific for rapid, presumptive identification of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Its chromogenic properties and its selectivity are particularly useful in specimens containing resident associated flora.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity between Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum  essential oils and methanol extracts.
AB  - Essential oils (EOs) and methanol extracts obtained from aerial parts of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum seeds were evaluated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against nine Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The essential oils and methanol extracts revealed promising antibacterial activities against most pathogens using broth microdilution method. Maximum activity of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum essential oils and methanol extracts (MIC 15.6 and 62.5mug/ml) were observed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris. Combinations of essential oils and methanol extracts showed an additive action against most tested pathogens especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Evaluation of different laboratory tests for the detection of metallo-beta-lactamase production in Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (91), Escherichia coli (49), Enterobacter spp. (27), Proteus mirabilis (17), Citrobacter freundii (2), Providencia stuartii (3) and Serratia spp. (5), with various MICs of imipenem, were examined for production of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) with different phenotypic laboratory tests that have been previously published to detect MBLs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. METHODS: A total of 194 (95 MBL-positive and 99 MBL-negative) clinical isolates with imipenem MICs < or = 0.25 to > 256 mg/L were examined. All isolates were evaluated by the double-disc synergy test (DDST), the combination disc test (CDT), the MBL Etest and the modified Hodge test. The presence of bla(VIM) and bla(IMP) genes was evaluated by in situ hybridization with specific probes and was certified by PCR. RESULTS: In 30 bla(VIM)-positive isolates that exhibited MICs of imipenem < or = 4 mg/L, MBL Etest could not be evaluated. CDT with ceftazidime and 1900 or 750 microg of EDTA, and DDST after applying an imipenem disc 10 mm apart from a disc containing approximately 1900 microg of EDTA, showed the highest sensitivity (97.9% to 100%) and specificity (87.9% to 96%) rates among the analysed procedures. CDT with imipenem and 1900 microg of EDTA exhibited a sensitivity of 94.7% and showed very good specificity (98%). CONCLUSIONS: The CDT with imipenem/imipenem+0.5 M EDTA or ceftazidime/ceftazidime+0.2 M EDTA and the DDST with imipenem 10 mm apart from EDTA are the most effective methods for the detection of MBLs in Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, against recent gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of European origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 S. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 526 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 Escherichia coli, 854 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 Proteus mirabilis, 406 Enterobacter cloacae, 387 Citrobacter spp., 291 Serratia marcescens, 621 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 Acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. RESULTS: Ceftobiprole activity against MRSA (MIC90 2 mg/L) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant CoNS (MIC90 2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible CoNS (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/L; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/L; -resistant, 0.5 mg/L) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. Ceftobiprole activity against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/L; non-susceptible, >32 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/L, non-susceptible, >32 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90: >32 mg/L for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. As with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or non-ESBL mediated]. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against MRSA and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. Given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Effect of Octenisept antiseptic on bioburden of neoplastic ulcers in patients with advanced cancer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of octenidine dihydrochloride (Octenisept, Schulke & Mayr) on the clinical condition and bacterial flora in neoplastic ulcers. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with advanced cancer and neoplastic ulcers were included in the study. Octenisept-moistened gauze dressings were applied to the ulcers three times daily. The clinical and bacteriological status of the wounds were assessed at baseline and after three weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-three bacterial strains were cultured at baseline. After three weeks of treatment, the tests were repeated on 16 patients. Clinical observations confirmed an improvement in the clinical condition of the ulcers, characterised by a reduction in necrosis, exudate levels, erythema and oedema. According to the bacteriological assessment, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated from the wounds. Enterococcus faecalis persisted in two patients, Escherichia coli in one patient and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in another patient. CONCLUSION: Octenispet was an effective antimicrobial: Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated in all ulcers. After three weeks of treatment, none of the ulcers developed an infection and there was an improvement in their clinical condition.
TI  - Etiology of foot intertrigo in the District of Afyonkarahisar, Turkey: a bacteriologic and mycologic study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foot intertrigo, occurring in the interdigital space, is mostly caused initially by dermatophytes and yeasts and less frequently by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. With time, a "complex" may develop in the setting of moisture and maceration that contains multiple fungal and bacterial organisms. METHODS: We examined and sampled 84 patients with toe web intertrigo for bacteriologic and mycologic studies. RESULTS: In the culture media, the prominent isolated pathogens as single agents were coagulase-negative staphylococci in 17.9% of patients, which is assessed as contamination from skin flora; Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 16.7%; dermatophytes, Corynebacterium minutissimum, and Staphylococcus aureus each in 11.9%; beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 2.4%; and Proteus mirabilis in 1.2%. However, we recovered double pathogens from patients with foot intertrigo as mixed infection in 19 patients (22.6%). The most common predisposing factors were exposure to spa pools and ablutions. CONCLUSIONS: Several pathogens and factors might play a role in toe web infections. Therefore, clinical and microbiologic studies are suggested to assist in the selection of appropriate treatment and the prevention of important complications of toe web infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Ocimum gratissimum L. From different  populations of Kenya.
AB  - Hydro-distilled volatile oils from the leaves of Ocimum gratissimum L. (Lamiaceae) of 13 populations of different silvicultural zones were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against gram positive (Staphylococcus aereus, Bacillus spp.) and gram negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Samonella typhi, Klebisiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria and a pathogenic fungus, Candida albicans. All the essential oils are active to the tested microbiles with different strength. The highest antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosae and Proteus mirabilis) was observed from the eastern Kenya (Meru) oil. Meru oil was the best and its effectiveness was consistent on nearly all the microbes tested. The oil from the plant growing in the coastal region of Kenya (Mombasa) showed the best effect only on gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Both oils (Meru and Mombasa) were dominated by monoterpenes accounting for 92.48% and 81.37% respectively. The monoterpene fraction was characterized by a high percentage of eugenol (68.8%) for Meru oil and 74.10% for Mombasa oil. The other major monoterpene was methyl eugenol (13.21%). Camphor (0.95%) was observed only in the Meru oil. (Cis)-Ocimene, (trans)-ocimene and beta-pinene were present in both Meru and Mombasa oils. The sesquiterpenes present in fairly good amounts in both oils were germacrene D and (trans)-caryophyllene. The minor sesquiterpenes were alpha-farnesene (0.85%) and beta-bisabolene (0.74%) which were present in the Meru oil only.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial intrahospital infections in newborns].
AB  - Nosocomial infections are important problem for the modern medicine. Especially sensitive category, susceptible to nosocomial infections, are the infants. The aim of the research was to establish an active monitoring over the breaking out of the nosocomial infections in the Neonatology Department of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic of the University Clinical Center Tuzla (UKC) and to determine the kind of bacteria that causes the nosocomial infections as well as the type of infection according to anatomical localization. The research encompassed 8000 of newborn infants at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in the years 2005 and 2006. The determining of the nosocomial infections was done by using the standard CDC criteria. The results show that in two researching years the leading nosocomial infections were bacteriemia, followed by other infections, respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The mostly identified carrier of the nosocomial infections in 2005 were gram-positive bacteria (65,5%): coagulase-negative staphylococci was isolated in 54,6%, Staphylococcus aureus in 5,5% and Streptococcus species in 5,5% of cases (p<0,001). The isolated gram-negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2005 were Klebisiella pneumoniae (21,8%), Escherichia coli (5,5%), Pseudomanas aeruginosa (3,6%) and Morganella morganii (3,6%) (p<0,05). In 2006 the mostly identified and isolated carriers of nosocomial infections were gram positive bacteria (64,2%): coagulase-negative Staphylococci (43,3%), Streptococcus species (13,4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7,5%) (p<0,001). Gram negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2006 were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19,4%), Escherichia coli (10,5%), Acinetobacter species (3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,5%) and Proteus mirabilis (1,5%) (p<0,05). The bacteriemia was mostly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Infections of the urinary tract were caused by gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Other infections were caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Infections of the respiratory tract were caused by Streptococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most frequent carriers of the nosocomial infections at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in 2005 and 2006 was gram-positive bacteria-coagulase-negative Staphylococci.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Characterization of Antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  - Five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various Antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. Twenty-two Antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis. None of the isolates inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus Candida albicans. Active Antarctic isolates, identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the Actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-Proteobacteria (6 strains). Inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.Results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of Antarctic marine bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.
TI  - In vitro activities of doripenem and six comparator drugs against 423 aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates from infected diabetic foot wounds.
AB  - Against 182 anaerobe and 241 aerobe strains obtained from diabetic foot infections, doripenem was the most active carbapenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis, and ertapenem was more active against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were < or =0.125 microg/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and all streptococci and 0.25/1 for Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic post-operative wounds in a regional referral hospital in Uganda.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wound infections have been a problem in the field of surgery for a long time. Advances in control of infections have not completely eradicated this problem because of development of drug resistance. Antimicrobial resistance can increase complications and costs associated with procedures and treatment. OBJECTIVE: A study was carried out on drug sensitivity patterns of bacterial isolates from septic postoperative wounds in Jinja hospital, Uganda. This study was designed to determine the distribution of bacterial pathogens isolated from septic post-operative wounds and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. METHOD: Specimens of pus swabs were collected aseptically and analysed in the laboratory. Colony characteristics and Grams technique were used to differentiate the organisms. Biochemical tests were done to confirm the species of the organisms. Sensitivity testing was done on the isolates using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Pathogenic bacteria were recovered from 58.5% of the specimens. The isolates were: S.aureus (45.1%), Coliforms (16.9%), Proteus mirabilis (11.3%), P.aeruginosa (9.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.0%) and Enterobacter spp (2.82%). Most of the organisms were sensitive to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. There was resistance to ampicillin, amoxycillin and chloramphenicol. Staphylococcus aureus was generally sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%), ciprofloxacin (68.7%) and methicillin (75%), but resistant to erythromycin (56.2%) and ampicillin (97%). Most of the gram-negative bacteria isolated (Coliforms, P.aeruginosa, E.coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin and Ceftazidime but resistant to Ampicillin, Amoxycillin and Chloramphenicol. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains formed 25% of this species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was sensitive to gentamicin (87.5%) and ceftazidime (85.7%) but showed resistance to ciprofloxacin (57.2%). Some organisms e.g. S.aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis exhibited multi-drug resistance to the antibiotics tested. CONCLUSION: Since a high proportion of samples had positive cultures, infection control is recommended as a strategy to minimise spread of resistant organisms. It is recommended that gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime be used in preference to ampicillin and amoxycillin for treatment of septic wounds. There is need to develop national surveillance of antibiotic- resistant organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Species interactions in mixed-community crystalline biofilms on urinary catheters.
AB  - Previous experimental investigations of the crystalline biofilms that colonize and block urinary catheters have focussed on their formation by pure cultures of Proteus mirabilis. In the urine of patients undergoing long-term catheterization, P. mirabilis is commonly found in mixed communities with other urinary tract pathogens. Little is known about the effect that the other species have on the rate at which P. mirabilis encrusts catheters. In the present study, a set of data on the nature of the bacterial communities on 106 catheter biofilms has been analysed and it was found that while species such as Providencia stuartii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were commonly associated with P. mirabilis, when Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii or Enterobacter cloacae were present, P. mirabilis was rarely or never found. The hypothesis that the absence of P. mirabilis from some biofilm communities could be due to its active exclusion by other species has also been examined. Experiments in laboratory models showed that co-infection of P. mirabilis with M. morganii, K. pneumoniae or E. coli had no effect on the ability of P. mirabilis to encrust and block catheters. Co-infection with Ent. cloacae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, significantly increased the time that catheters took to block (P <0.05). The growth of Ent. cloacae, M. morganii, K. pneumoniae or E. coli in the model for 72 h prior to superinfection with P. mirabilis significantly delayed catheter blockage. In the case of Ent. cloacae, for example, the mean time to blockage was extended from 28.7 h to 60.7 h (P < or =0.01). In all cases, however, P. mirabilis was able to generate alkaline urine, colonize the biofilms, induce crystal formation and block the catheters. The results suggest that although there is a degree of antagonism between P. mirabilis and some of the other urinary tract organisms, the effects are temporary and whatever the pre-existing urinary microbiota, infection with P. mirabilis is thus likely to lead to catheter encrustation and blockage.
TI  - Use of in vitro susceptibility and pathogen prevalence data to model the expected clinical success rates of tigecycline and other commonly used antimicrobials for empirical treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - The overall expected coverage for tigecycline and selected antimicrobial regimens based upon prevailing susceptibility rates was evaluated for the empirical therapy of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs). Consecutive, non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected from 2000-2005 from patients with documented cSSSI in 57 medical centres located in the USA (38 centres), France (6 centres), Germany (7 centres), Italy (3 centres) and Spain (3 centres) were used to evaluate the frequency of pathogen occurrence and susceptibility rates of select parenteral antimicrobials (SENTRY Program). By applying pathogen-specific susceptibility rates to the frequency of pathogen occurrence in each country, the overall expected coverage for each treatment regimen was measured. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (33.3-49.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3-17.2%), Escherichia coli (6.6-13.9%) and enterococci (4.1-8.8%). Tigecycline was highly active against the most common pathogens, except for P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The highest overall expected empirical coverage was obtained with combination therapy regimens, including vancomycin plus either imipenem (94.4-99.3%) or piperacillin/tazobactam (92.5-98.2%). Among the monotherapy regimens evaluated, tigecycline provided the highest overall expected coverage in the USA (90.6%), France (89.9%) and Italy (83.3%), whilst piperacillin/tazobactam showed the highest expected coverage in Germany (93.1%) and imipenem in Spain (87.7%). Our results suggest that tigecycline represents a viable additional option for the empirical treatment of cSSSI in these countries.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (Actichelated propolis).
AB  - AIMS: This study compared in vitro activities of Actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater potency of Actichelated propolis (MIC range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (MIC range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). Concentrations of Actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. Preincubation of Strep. pyogenes and H. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of Actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x MIC) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Effect of natural preservatives on the growth of histamine producing bacteria.
AB  - Present study deals with the hampering of the growth of histamine producing bacteria (HPB), by using NaCl and spices which are easily available and cheaper cost wise. For this experiment, four strains of HPB viz. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were tested against 1 to 10% concentrations of NaCl and 1 to 5% concentrations of natural preservatives (turmeric, ginger and garlic) in a basal medium. HPB showed different growth rates at different concentrations of NaCl and natural preservatives. V. parahaemolyticus, B. cereus and Ps. aeruginosa showed no growth at 10% concentration. When the HPB growth was tested with garlic, turmeric and ginger extracts, growth of all the bacteria was inhibited by garlic and turmeric extracts at 5% concentration. In ginger, V. parahaemolyticus, B. cereus and P. mirabilis were totally inhibited at 5% concentration. But Ps. aeruginosa showed very less growth at this concentration.
TI  - Breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have also affected the microbial profile of breast abscesses. OBJECTIVE: To update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: County hospital emergency department. PATIENTS: Forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range, 20-63 years) with breast abscesses. METHODS: All cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. RESULTS: Of 46 specimens only 28 showed bacterial yield (61%). Of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. The most common organism was S aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with MRSA in 7 (58%). The remaining organisms included coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). All MRSA was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. Only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. Two anaerobic cultures were positive for Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. Many breast abscesses have community-acquired MRSA, with more than 50% of all S aureus and 19% of all cultures being MRSA. This finding parallels the local and national increases in MRSA reported in other soft-tissue infections. With increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli causing infections in intensive care unit patients in the United States between 1993 and 2004.
AB  - During the 12-year period from 1993 to 2004, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of 74,394 gram-negative bacillus isolates recovered from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in United States hospitals were determined by participating hospitals and collected in a central location. MICs for 12 different agents were determined using a standardized broth microdilution method. The 11 organisms most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%), Escherichia coli (18.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (9.1%), Acinetobacter spp. (6.2%), Serratia marcescens (5.5%), Enterobacter aerogenes (4.4%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.3%), Proteus mirabilis (4.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (2.7%), and Citrobacter freundii (2.0%). Specimen sources included the lower respiratory tract (52.1%), urine (17.3%), and blood (14.2%). Rates of resistance to many of the antibiotics tested remained stable during the 12-year study period. Carbapenems were the most active drugs tested against most of the bacterial species. E. coli and P. mirabilis remained susceptible to most of the drugs tested. Mean rates of resistance to 9 of the 12 drugs tested increased with Acinetobacter spp. Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin increased over the study period for most species. Ceftazidime was the only agent to which a number of species (Acinetobacter spp., C. freundii, E. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. marcescens) became more susceptible. The prevalence of multidrug resistance, defined as resistance to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin, one aminoglycoside, and ciprofloxacin, increased substantially among ICU isolates of Acinetobacter spp., P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae.
TI  - [Selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. METHODS: Fifty-six SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. All the animals were incurred with 30% III degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20 mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. The animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. At the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. The number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. RESULTS: Antibiotics significantly increased the number of cocci (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. In selective culture of gut bacilli, E.Coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis appeared. After the rats received antibiotics treatment, E. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus and other bacilli. CONCLUSION: Broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. Then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.
TI  - [Ecthyma gangrenosum in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ecthymagangrenosum is a rare disease of the skin that causes the localized necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous fat tissue, leading to the multiple ulcerations surrounded by local hyperaemia. The ulcerations are usually localized in groins, and perianal area. In the majority of cases ecthyma is caused by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis. The disease usually appears in immunocompromized, most frequently hematological patients. CASE REPORT: We presented a 78-year-old woman who had been treated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma for the last 18 years. She had recently been given cytotoxics which led to neutropenia. The patient suddenly developed high fever, chill and diarrhea, followed by ecthyma gangrenosum cutaneous lesions in groins, axillas, right side of the neck and umbilicus. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, that were sensitive to several antibiotics were isolated. The treatment included rehydratation, antibiotics, surgical debridement and regular dressing with antiseptics. The healing of all lesions was achieved after sixteen weeks of the treatment. CONCLUSION: If haemorrhagic-necrotic lesions of the skin are developed in immunocompromised, usually haematologic patients, an Ecthyma gangrenosum has to be considered immediately, material for identification of a cause has to be taken, followed by immediate administration of antibiotics effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Surgical debridement and other therapeutic modalities are to be considered in some patients.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance pattern in uropathogens.
AB  - Uropathogenic strains from inpatient and outpatient departments were studied from April 1997 to March 1999 for their susceptibility profiles. The various isolates were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumanii and Enterococcus faecalis. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern of these isolates revealed that for outpatients, first generation cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, norfloxacin/ciprofloxacin were effective for treatment of urinary tract infection but for inpatients, parenteral therapy with newer aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins need to be advocated as the organisms for nosocomial UTI exhibit a high degree of drug resistance. Trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole combination was not found to be effective for the treatment of urinary tract infections as all the uropathogens from inpatients and outpatients showed high degree of resistance to co-trimoxazole. Culture and sensitivity of the isolates from urine samples should be done as a routine before advocating the therapy.

TI  - Investigation of essential oil extracts from four native Jamaican species of Bursera for antibacterial activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infection with organisms resistant to antibiotics have increased during the last few decades worldwide. Because of this increase, the authors decided to subject the essential oils from the stem, leaves and fruits of the four native Jamaica species of Bursera to microbial studies. METHODS: Steam distillate extracts from different parts of four native Jamaican spp of Bursera simaruba (Red Birch), Bursera lunanii (Black Birch), Bursera hollickii and Bursera aromatica (Siboney) were tested for their antibacterial activity against six common pathogens: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylocococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A (BHSA) using a disk diffusion assay. RESULTS: The investigation revealed that extracts from two of the four plants tested were active against all the pathogens. These were extracts from the fruits and stems of B. simaruba and those from the fruit of B. lunanii. CONCLUSION: This study gives credence to the ongoing search for locally available plants whose extracts possess significant antimicrobial activity. This may be useful in the development of naturally derived pharmaceuticals.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacilli from Yaounde Central Hospital, Cameroon.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance among bacteria pathogens is a world-wide issue. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common pathogenic bacteria are essential to guide empirical and pathogen-specific therapy; unfortunately, these data are scarse in Cameroon. OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Gram-negative bacilli isolated in Yaounde Central Hospital Laboratory of Bacteriology. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 505), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) in Yaounde Central Hospital Laboratory of Bacteriology between March 1995 and April 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. RESULTS: High rates of resistance were found in most of the bacteria studied. Resistance to all isolates was mostly observed for amoxicillin (87%), piperacillin (74%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (73%). Susceptibilities to third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) and monobactame (aztreonam) were = 91% for Escherichia coli, = 71% for Klebsiella spp., = 98% for Proteus mirabilis, = 50% for Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefotaxime (2%) and aztreonam (33%), and highly susceptible to ceftazidime (72%) whereas Acinetobacter baumannii was highly resistant to aztreonam (100%), to cefotaxime (96%) and cetazidime (62%). Imipenem (98%) was the most active antibiotic followed by the ofloxacine (88%). Susceptibility of all isolates to gentamicin was 67%. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that surveillance to antimicrobial resistance in Cameroon is necessary to monitor microbial trends, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and provide information for choosing empirical or direct therapy to physicians.
TI  - Synthesis and structure of silver complexes with nicotinate-type ligands having antibacterial activities against clinically isolated antibiotic resistant pathogens.
AB  - The synthesis and low-temperature X-ray crystal structures of five new silver complexes, [Ag(2)-mu-O,O'(2-aminonicotinium)(2)(NO(3))(2)](n) (7), [Ag(isonicotinamide)(2)-mu-O,O'(NO(3))](2) (8), [Ag(ethyl nicotinate)(2)](NO(3)) (9), [Ag(ethyl isonicotinate)(2)(NO(3))] (10), and [Ag(methyl isonicotinate)(2)(H(2)O)](NO(3)) (11), are presented and fully characterized by spectral and elemental analysis. The antimicrobial activities of these complexes were screened using 12 different clinical isolates belonging to four pathogenic bacteria, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, P. mirabilis, and Ps. Aeruginosa, all obtained from diabetic foot ulcers. These tested bacteria were resistant for at least 10 antibiotics commonly used for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Compounds 7 and 8 had considerable activity against Ps. Aeruginosa (MIC values 2-8 microg/mL), compound 9 against S. aureus (MIC 4-16 microg/mL) and S. pyogenes (MIC 2-4 microg/mL), and also 9 and 11 against P. mirabilis (MIC 1-16 microg/mL). All complexes were non-toxic for daphnia at concentrations above 512 microg/mL overnight.

AB  - Although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the CLSI currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of MBLs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (DDTs) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and Tris-EDTA (TE) to detect MBLs. Sixteen isolates (4 Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 Serratia marcescens isolate, 1 Aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 Aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 Chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing IMP-1, IMP-1-like, IMP-18, GIM-1, SPM-1, VIM-2, VIM-2-like, and chromosomal MBLs and 20 isolates (7 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 Escherichia coli isolates, 5 Enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 S. marcescens isolates, 1 Proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 A. baumannii isolates) producing non-MBL carbapenemases, AmpC beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. The DDT method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (TE, high-strength TE, MPA, and TE plus 20 microl of MPA [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEM), ertapenem (ERT), and ceftazidime (CAZ). DDTs with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 1:320 MPA detected all MBLs and yielded no false-positive results. Some, but not all, MBL producers were detected in IPM-based tests involving the single chelator TE or MPA alone or by ERT- or CAZ-based tests. IPM-based tests with MPA concentrations other than 1:320 and all MEM-based tests had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. DDT with IPM and a TE disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 MPA appears to be convenient for the detection of MBLs in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a series of thiosemicarbazones and their Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes.
AB  - Thirty-four thiosemicarbazones and S-alkyl thiosemicarbazones, and some of their  Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes were obtained and purified to investigate antimicrobial activity. MIC values of the compounds were determined by the disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida albicans. The thiosemicarbazones show antibacterial and antifungal effects in free ligand and metal-complex form. Picolinaldehyde-S-methyl- and -S-benzylthiosemicarbazones did not affect the tested microorganisms but their Zn(II) complexes showed selective activity. The antimicrobial activity is relatively high in Me2SO, but the antimicrobial potential is changed in a certain range with Me2SO, HCONMe2, EtOH and CHCl3.
TI  - In vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of H2 receptor antagonists.
AB  - Enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. There are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. On the other hand H2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. As the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. In present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a B.P. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and H2-receptor antagonists alone. The interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. These studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (pH 9) and buffers of pH 7.4 simulating blood pH at 37 degrees C. In order to support these interaction studies, the effect of H2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (MIC) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with H2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in MIC of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Canine cathelicidin (K9CATH): gene cloning, expression, and biochemical activity  of a novel pro-myeloid antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - Cathelicidins, a group of cationic peptides found in leukocytes and epithelial cells, play a central role in the early innate immune defense against infection. Although these host defense peptides have been reported in several mammalian species, including primates, no cathelicidins have been identified in carnivores. Here we report the cloning, tissue expression and biological activity of a novel canine cathelicidin (K9CATH). The full-length cDNA sequence of K9CATH encodes a predicted 172 amino acid pre-propeptide that is 60-70% similar to other mammalian cathelicidins. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the 38 aa mature K9CATH peptide was present in neutrophil granule contents. Synthetic K9CATH displayed broad antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus; MICs (minimal inhibitory concentrations) 0.5 and 50 microM, respectively), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis; MICs 1.25 microM, Salmonella serotype Enteritidis; MIC 0.5 microM, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MIC 0.06 microM), and yeast (Candida albicans; MIC 12.5-50 microM). K9CATH demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against Ureaplasma canigenitalium, and lower activity against Ureaplasma urealyticum (MIC 0.06 and 50 microM, respectively). Similar to its ovine congener SMAP-29, K9CATH possesses salt-independent antimicrobial activity and LPS binding capacity. K9CATH displayed minimal hemolytic activity against human, dog and chicken erythrocytes. The potency and broad antimicrobial activity of K9CATH suggest that this peptide may act as a fundamental contributor to the innate immune responses in this carnivore species.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial profiles of selected isoquinoline alkaloids from Fumaria and Corydalis species.
AB  - In the current study, 33 isoquinoline alkaloids belonging to protopine-, benzylisoquinoline-, benzophenanthridine-, spirobenzylisoquinoline-, phthalideisoquinoline-, aporphine-, protoberberine-, cularine-, and isoquinolone-types as well as 7 derivatives of them obtained from some Fumaria and Corydalis species growing in Turkey have been evaluated for their in vitro antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madine-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines and their maximum non-toxic concentrations (MNTC) and cytopathogenic effects (CPE) were determined using acyclovir and oseltamivir as the references. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the alkaloids were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans by the microdilution method and compared to ampicilline, ofloxacine, and ketocanazole as the references. The alkaloids did not present any notable antibacterial effect, while they had significant antifungal activity at 8 microg/ml concentration. On the other hand, the alkaloids were found to have selective inhibition against the PI-3 virus ranging between 0.5 and 64 microg/ml as minimum and maximum CPE inhibitory concentrations, whereas they were completely inactive towards HSV.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of flexible endoscope disinfection in two Brazilian hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: [corrected] Endoscopes are routinely used in hospitals and clinics of the world and they can be potential sources of cross-infection when the decontamination process is unsuitable AIM: The routines of flexible endoscope (bronchoscopes, esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes) disinfection procedures used in two Brazilian university hospitals were evaluated during a 3-year period METHODS: Aleatory samples from internal channels of endoscopes were collected after patient examination and after cleaning/disinfection procedures RESULTS: A contamination >3 log10 was achieved in samples recovered from endoscopes after patient examination. These samples yielded gram-negative bacilli (n = 142: 56%), gram-positive cocci (n = 43: 17%), yeast cells (n = 43: 17%), and gram-positive bacilli (n = 26: 10%). Approximately, 72 out of 149 samples (48.32%) collected after undergoing the cleaning and disinfection procedures disclosed gram-negative bacilli (n = 55: 61%), gram-positive cocci (n = 21: 23%), gram-positive bacilli (n = 8: 9%) and yeast cells (n = 6: 7%). Esophagogastroduodenoscopes and colonoscopes were the most frequently contaminated devices. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, Bacillus spp and Corynebacterium spp were predominantly identified CONCLUSION: Inappropriate cleaning and low times of disinfection were respectively the major factors associated with the presence of microorganisms in colonoscopes and esophagogastroduodenoscopes. By analyzing the identified germs, hospital disinfection was considered of either intermediate or poor level. After this investigation, both university centers improved their previous protocols for disinfection and conditions for reprocessing endoscopes.
TI  - A new antibacterial compound produced by an indigenous marine bacteria--fermentation, isolation, and biological activity.
AB  - The use of microorganisms for biological purpose has become an effective alternative to control pathogens. A marine bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from Eal fish of Baluchistan coast of Pakistan. This strain produced a bactericidal antibiotic against environmental and clinical isolates. In this study, we purified bactericidal antibiotic from the ethyl acetate extract of the cells of P. aeruginosa and analyzed its chemical structure. Based on spectrometric analysis, this compound 1 is proposed to be 1-methyl-1,4 dihydroquinoline and is active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio aliginolyticus, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter faecium but it is not active against G streptococci, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger. Minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive bacteria was between 50 and 75 microg mL(-1) and for Gram-negative bacteria 75-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - Potency and spectrum of garenoxacin tested against an international collection of skin and soft tissue infection pathogens: report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (1999-2004).
AB  - The spectrum and potency of garenoxacin, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, against a large international collection (11723 strains) of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) were evaluated for the years 1999 to 2004. Consecutive nonduplicate bacterial isolates were collected from patients with documented community-acquired or nosocomial SSTI in >70 medical centers participating in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program in North America (37.4%), Europe (26.7%), Latin America (16.7%), and the Asia-Pacific region (19.2%). All isolates were tested using the reference broth microdilution methods against garenoxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and representative comparator agents used for the empiric or directed therapy for SSTI. Ranking pathogens producing SSTI during these years included Staphylococcus aureus (42.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.1%), Escherichia coli (9.0%), Enterococcus spp. (7.3%), Klebsiella spp. (4.8%), Enterobacter spp. (4.7%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.5%), and Acinetobacter spp. (2.1%). Garenoxacin was the most potent agent tested against S. aureus and was at least 2-fold more active than gatifloxacin (MIC(50), 0.06 mg/L) and 8-fold more active than levofloxacin (MIC(50), 0.25 mg/L). Furthermore, garenoxacin was 2- to 8-fold more potent than the fluoroquinolones against beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, as well as up to 4-fold more active against enterococci. Garenoxacin was largely comparable with the comparator fluoroquinolones against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Acinetobacter spp., but it is less active than these agents against P. aeruginosa. In summary, garenoxacin was documented to be the most potent quinolone when tested against key Gram-positive pathogens (S. aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci) and was similar in activity to these agents against other species (Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp.). These in vitro data suggest that garenoxacin warrants further clinical studies in SSTI, especially against staphylococci and streptococcal pathogens.
TI  - An in vitro assessment of the antibacterial effect of garlic (Allium sativum) on  bacterial isolates from wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Garlic (Allium sativum) has come to be seen as an all rounded treatment for preventing wound infection, common cold, malaria, cough and lung tuberculosis, hypertension, sexually transmitted diseases, mental illness, kidney diseases, liver diseases, asthma, diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to assess the antibacterial effect of crude preparation of garlic on bacterial isolates from the wound infections. METHODS: An experimental study was conducted in Gondar University Teaching Hospital School of Medical Laboratory Technology, Microbiology Laboratory from June 2004 to April 2005 by agar dilution technique. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of garlic to control strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATTC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATTCC 25922, as well as to clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using agar dilution method The data was collected in triplicate. RESULTS: All the tested organisms were inhibited by 33.75 mg/ml of the crude preparation of garlic except control organism and clinical isolates of S. aureus, which were inhibited by 11.25 mg/ml of crude garlic. Garlic did not reveal bactericidal effect up to a concentration of 37.5 mg/ml against all the tested organisms. CONCLUSION: Crude preparation of garlic could be used as an effective antibacterial agent for the tested organisms. Nevertheless, clinical trial on the effect of garlic is essential before advocating large-scale therapy.
TI  - Phytochemisty and spermatogenic potentials of aqueous extract of Cissus populnea  (Guill. and Per) stem bark.
AB  - In vivo clinical trials involving the administration of crude extracts of Cissus  populnea to male subjects (normospermic, oligospermic, and azoopermic) in a 72-day study revealed that continuous exposure of the subjects to the extracts over this period did not significantly (p < or = 0.05) alter sperm count, morphology, motility, or volume. Antimicrobial screening of the extract against some selected microbial isolates secondarily implicated in male infertility revealed total inactivity against the microbial isolates screened, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella paratyphi, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Klebsiella sp. Phytochemistry revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, saponins, and steroids. The presence of these secondary metabolites was confirmed by thin layer chromatography. We conclude that oral administration of aqueous extracts of the stem bark of Cisssus populnea over a 72-day period to human subjects apparently had no fertility enhancement effects on sperm parameters monitored in this study.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Emblica officinalis and Coriandrum sativum against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
AB  - Present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of Emblica officinalis (amla) and Coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of Gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. Aqueous infusion and decoction of Emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (270), Klebsiella pneumoniae (51), K. ozaenae (3), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), Salmonella typhi (1), S. paratyphi A (2), S. paratyphi B (1) and Serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against Gram negative urinary pathogens.
TI  - Epidemiology and bacterial colonization of burn injuries in Blantyre.
AB  - Forty-nine patients from the Burns Unit at the QECH had swabs taken from various  sites in order to determine the bacterial profile and antibiotic susceptibilities in burn wounds colonized by bacteria. The mean age was 16 years (range 1-70 years); 27 (55 %) of the study population were female and 22 (45%) were male. Twenty-four (49%) patients were epileptic. Open fire (41%) was the most common cause of burn injuries among epileptics while hot water burns (29%) were commonest among non-epileptics. Burn injury and percentage total burn surface area (% TBSA) injuries decreased with age, and the upper and lower limbs, trunk, head and neck were the most commonly affected sites. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate (23%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (22.7%), Streptococci spp (15.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%) and 3.4% for Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Klebsiella spp. There was a significant trend of bacterial growth with increasing % TBSA (p<0.001). Bacterial growth was significantly more common in more recent burns of less than 20 days compared to burns of longer duration (OR 4.1 [95% CI 1.58-10.99]). Broad-spectrum antibiotics are required as first-line therapy for burns-related sepsis but there is need for surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility to help determine appropriate therapy.
TI  - Effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and EDTA combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (OT), protamine sulfate (PS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro activity of OT, PS and EDTA alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. All the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. However, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. Furthermore, 79-95% reduction in Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. CONCLUSION: The subinhibitory concentrations of OT, PS and EDTA in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds such as OT, PS and EDTA may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of snake, scorpion and bee venoms: a comparison with purified venom phospholipase A2 enzymes.
AB  - AIMS: Venoms of snakes, scorpions, bees and purified venom phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) enzymes were examined to evaluate the antibacterial activity of purified venom enzymes as compared with that of the crude venoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-four crude venoms, nine purified PLA(2)s and two L-amino acid oxidases (LAAO) were studied for antibacterial activity by disc-diffusion assay (100 microg ml(-1)). Several snake venoms (Daboia russelli russelli, Crotalus adamanteus, Naja sumatrana, Pseudechis guttata, Agkistrodon halys, Acanthophis praelongus and Daboia russelli siamensis) showed activity against two to four different pathogenic bacteria. Daboia russelli russelli and Pseudechis australis venoms exhibited the most potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, while the rest showed only a moderate activity against one or more bacteria. The order of susceptibility of the bacteria against viperidae venoms was -S. aureus > Proteus mirabilis > Proteus vulgaris > Enterobacter aerogenes > Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against S. aureus was studied by dilution method (160-1.25 microg ml(-1)). A stronger effect was noted with the viperidae venoms (20 microg ml(-11)) as compared with elapidae venoms (40 microg ml(-1)). The MIC were comparable with those of the standard drugs (chloramphenicol, streptomycin and penicillin). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that viperidae (D. russelli russelli) and elapidae (P. australis) venoms have significant antibacterial effects against gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria, which may be the result of the primary antibacterial components of laao, and in particular, the PLA(2) enzymes. The results would be useful for further purification and characterization of antibacterial agents from snake venoms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The activity of LAAO and PLA(2) enzymes may be associated with the antibacterial activity of snake venoms.
TI  - Evaluating antibiotics for use in medicine using a poloxamer biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wound infections, due to biofilms, are a constant problem because of  their recalcitrant nature towards antibiotics. Appropriate antibiotic selection for the treatment of these biofilm infections is important. The traditional in vitro disc diffusion method for antibiotic selection uses bacterial cultures grown on agar plates. However, the form of bacterial growth on agar is not representative of how bacteria grow in wounds and other tissue sites as here bacteria grow naturally in a biofilm. The aim of this research was to test a more appropriate method for testing antimicrobial efficacy on biofilms and compare with the standard methods used for antibiotic sensitivity testing. METHODS: Outer Membrane Protein analysis was performed on E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Acinetobacter juni when grown on Mueller Hinton agar ('quasi-biofilm state') and 30% Poloxamer hydrogel ('true- biofilm state). Susceptibility to antibiotics on 28 clinical isolates was determined using the modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method, on agar and 30% Poloxamer. RESULTS: Similar outer membrane proteins [OMPs] were identified in bacteria grown in a biofilm state and on a 30% poloxamer hydrogel, which were very different to the OMPs identified in bacteria grown on Mueller-Hinton agar and broth. There was a significant difference between the means of the clearance zones around the antibiotic discs on standard agar and poloxamer gels [P < 0.05]. The zones of clearance were generally smaller for poloxamer-grown bacteria than those grown on standard agar. Diffusion distances of various antibiotics through agar and 30% poloxamer showed no significant difference [P > 0.05]. CONCLUSION: The findings of this experiment suggest that poloxamer gel could be used as an appropriate medium on which to conduct biofilm antibiotic susceptibility tests as it enables bacteria to be grown in a state representative of the infected surface from which the culture was taken.
TI  - Calcium sulphate delivery system with tobramycin for the treatment of chronic calcaneal osteomyelitis.
AB  - The case of a 24-year-old woman with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis chronic calcaneal osteomyelitis is presented. Extensive debridement of the necrotic bone and application of tobramycin-loaded polymethylmethacrylate beads was performed and ciprofloxacin was given post-operatively. Three months later, laboratory tests, including complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, were normal. At this time, extensive surgical debridement and filling of the osseous defect with autologous iliac cancellous bone graft and tobramycin-impregnated calcium sulphate pellets and paste were performed. Oral ciprofloxacin was administered for 3 months after surgery. At the latest follow-up, 2 years later, the patient had full weight-bearing function; there was no recurrence of the infection, and complete incorporation of the autologous bone and calcium sulphate graft with the host bone was observed. This case demonstrates that two-stage surgical treatment with extensive debridement and tobramycin-impregnated calcium sulphate was effective in treating chronic calcaneal osteomyelitis.
TI  - [Bacteriological evaluation in chronic otitis media].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In chronic otitis media bacterial infection is often a cause of exacerbation in the clinical course and failure in treatment. The aim of the study was to investigate the incidence and profile of the aerobic bacterial flora in chronic otitis media and to determine the drug susceptibility of selected isolated bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The samples of 274 consecutive middle ear discharges taken from 228 patients with chronic otitis media were analysed (which constitutes 41.3% all bacteriological examinations made during 3 years). The smears were obtained using sterile cotton swabs, then incubated and identified. Drug susceptibility was determined by disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: Monocultures were observed in 77% and mixed infections in 17.5% of smears, no growth was found in 5.5%. The 308 pathogen isolates were recovered, among them--273 bacterial (88.6%) and 35--fungal (11.4%). Twenty five species of bacterial microorganisms were found, among them the most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus--42.9% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa---19.8%. Rarely were recovered Acinetobacter spp.--4.1%, Proteus mirabilis--37%, Proteus vulgaris--3.3% and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus--1.5% of bacterial isolates. Among fungal pathogens (n=35) Aspergillus spp. was isolated in 37.1%, and Candida albicans--22.9% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Aerobic pathogens ---aphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were most frequently found microorganisms in chronic otitis media. (2) Mixed infections comprised only a 17.5% of all cultured cases of chronic otitis media. (3) Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible in vitro to imipenem (100%), piperacillin-tazobactam (100%), ceftazidime (98%) and amikacin (89.7%), less susceptible to ciprofloxacin (77.6%) and much less susceptible to pefloxacin (33.6%) and cefotaxim (33.3%).
TI  - [Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation in bronchiectatic patients and clinical reflections].
AB  - Bronchiectasis is characterized with irreversible dilatation according to destruction of epithelium, elastic and muscular layer. Most important cause of bronchiectasis is chronic bacterial infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation is frequently seen in bronchiectatic patients. We aimed to find out P. aeruginosa colonisation frequency and clinical, radiological and spirometric reflections due to colonisation. We analysed 83 cases retrospectively. Mean age was 58.2 and 54.2% of them were female. Bronchiectasis were localised 19.3% in left lung, 19.3% right and 61.4% bilaterally. 29 (35.8%) normal, 28 (34.6%) obstructive, 7 (8.6%) restrictive, 17 (21%) mixed type disorders are detected in spirometric measures. Sputum culture performed in 50 cases. No microorganism colonisation determined in 30 (60%) cases, P. aeruginosa colonisation 16 (32%), Haemophilus influenzae 2 (4%), 1 (2%) Streptococcus pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis 1 (2%) cases. P. aeruginosa colonisation determined more frequent in males (p<0.05). No significant correlation detected between colonisation and age or smoking habits (p>0.05). In cases with colonisation; clubbing and hemoptysis were significantly frequent (p<0.05). Only peribronchial thickening was significantly correlated with colonisation in radiological findings (p<0.05). In blood gase analysis PaO2, oxygen saturation were lower and PaCO2 higher in cases colonised with P. aeruginosa but it was not statisticaly significant (p>0.05). Hospitalization rate was higher in P. aeruginosa colonised cases (p>0.05). It is an important problem about mortality because of higher hemoptysis and hospitalisation requirement rate in P. aeruginosa colonised cases.
TI  - Comparison of three techniques for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify an appropriate sampling technique(s) to accurately detect the bacteria causing urinary tract infections in dogs with urolithiasis. METHODS: Twenty-one dogs with urolithiasis were included in the study. Three types of samples were taken from each dog. Urine was collected by cystocentesis, and a urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith were retrieved during cystotomy. The samples were then cultured on blood agar and MacConkey's agar to identify the bacteria associated with urinary tract infections. RESULTS: Bacterial urinary tract infection was found in 16 cases (76.19 per cent). The most prevalent bacteria found to cause urinary tract infection were Escherichia coli (n=7), followed by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus species (n=4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=2) and Proteus mirabilis (n=1). In the case of a positive urine culture, the same bacteria were also cultured from the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy alone or from both the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith. However, in the case of a negative urine culture, bacteria were found to be present in the urinary bladder mucosal biopsy or urolith cultures in 23.81 per cent of dogs. The uroliths that gave positive culture results were either infection-induced uroliths composed of struvite and calcium carbonate phosphate, ammonium acid urate only or metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, or calcium phosphate only. All the uroliths that gave negative culture results were metabolic uroliths composed of calcium oxalate and/or calcium phosphate, and uric acid and calcium phosphate. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: When the culture from the urine obtained by cystocentesis is negative, cultures of urinary bladder mucosal biopsy and urolith are recommended in dogs with urolithiasis in order to accurately assess the microbiological status of the urinary tract.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activities of Anthocephalus cadamba.
AB  - Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.) Miq. Syn A. chinensis (Lamk) A. Rich (Rubiaceae) is ethnomedicinally widely used in the form of paste by tribe in western Ghats for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobial potential of A. cadamba against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing. The alchoholic and aqueous extract of this plant showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and four fungi Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum--dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus nidulans--systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that A. cadamba extract has potent wound healing capacity as shown from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that A. cadamba extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity.
TI  - Comparison of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic indices of efficacy for 5 fluoroquinolones toward pathogens of dogs and cats.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones are often used interchangeably in dogs and cats. HYPOTHESIS: Predicted therapeutic efficacy differs among fluoroquinolones. ANIMALS: Bacterial pathogens isolated from dogs and cats. METHODS: Using microtube-dilution procedures, percent resistance and 2 pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic indices (maximum concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration [Cmax/MIC] [target 0.10] and area under curve/minimum inhibitory concentration [AUC/MIC] [target 0.125]) were compared prospectively at low and high doses (mg/kg) for ciprofloxacin (5 and 20), difloxacin (5 and 10), enrofloxacin (including enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin) (5 and 20), marbofloxacin (2.5 and 5), and orbifloxacin (2.5 and 7.5). Indices were calculated for organisms represented by < or = 15 isolates. RESULTS: Percent resistance for all Gram-negative (n = 180; 20+/-3%; 39+/-5% for Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive isolates (n = 66; 18+/-3%) did not differ among drugs or organisms. The pattern of Cmax/MIC was generally enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin > or = enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin > or = marbofloxacin > or = orbifloxacin > or = difloxacin; and for AUIC/ MIC, enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin > or = marbofloxacin > or = ciprofloxacin > or = enrofloxacin > difloxacin > orbifloxacin. Among susceptible Gram-negative isolates studied (n = 117), targeted Cmax/MIC or AUC/MIC were achieved in 88% of E. coli, 53% of Proteus mirabilis, and 35% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and for susceptible Gram-positive isolates studied (n = 49), 53% of Streptotoccus spp. and Staphylococcus intermedius and 27% of Staphylococcus spp. At the high dose, the proportion of isolates for which a target was reached was: ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin+ciprofloaxin, and marbofloxacin (77%), enrofloxacin (73%), orbifloxacin (51%), and difloxacin (40%); and at the low dose, enrofloxacin+ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin (43%), ciprofloxacin (40%), marbofloxacin (39%), orbifloxacin (29%), and difloxacin (28%). CONCLUSIONS: E. coli resistance to fluoroquinolones approximated 40%. For susceptible isolates, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin more consistently reached indices associated with predicted efficacy, but only at the high dose.
TI  - Increased resistance to first-line agents among bacterial pathogens isolated from urinary tract infections in Latin America: time for local guidelines?
AB  - Emerging resistance phenotypes and antimicrobial resistance rates among pathogens recovered from community-acquired urinary tract infections (CA-UTI) is an increasing problem in specific regions, limiting therapeutic options. As part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, a total of 611 isolates were collected in 2003 from patients with CA-UTI presenting at Latin American medical centers. Each strain was tested in a central laboratory using Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methods with appropriate controls. Escherichia coli was the leading pathogen (66%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (7%), Proteus mirabilis (6.4%), Enterococcus spp. (5.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.6%). Surprisingly high resistance rates were recorded for E. coli against first-line orally administered agents for CA-UTI, such as ampicillin (53.6%), TMP/SMX (40.4%), ciprofloxacin (21.6%), and gatifloxacin (17.1%). Decreased susceptibility rates to TMP/SMX and ciprofloxacin were also documented for Klebsiella spp. (79.1 and 81.4%, respectively), and P. mirabilis (71.8 and 84.6%, respectively). For Enterococcus spp., susceptibility rates to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin were 88.2, 85.3, 55.9, and 97.1%, respectively. High-level resistance to gentamicin was detected in 24% of Enterococcus spp. Bacteria isolated from patients with CA-UTI in Latin America showed limited susceptibility to orally administered antimicrobials, especially for TMP/SMX and fluoroquinolones. Our results highlight the need for developing specific CA-UTI guidelines in geographic regions where elevated resistance to new and old compounds may influence prescribing decisions.
TI  - In-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. Triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. The bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli C1214, Proteus mirabilis 296, Enterococcus faecalis 1131, Klebsiella pneumoniae 280, Staphylococcus aureus Newman, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. Generic stents were utilized as controls. RESULTS: Triclosan inhibited the growth of E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and P. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. Lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated E. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein X and p-fimbriae. Triclosan stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. This drug-eluting stent provides both mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
AB  - In the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus Candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. On the other hand, both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. According to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against S. aureus and E. faecalis with MIC values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by E. coli (2 microg/ml), K. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), A. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and B. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited C. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. However, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards PI-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (CPE).
TI  - Otogenic intracranial complications. a 7-year retrospective review.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to review our experience on intracranial complications secondary to otitis media (OM), and to compare the results to those occurring 10-15 years ago. We also reviewed the timing of both otologic and neurosurgical treatments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients with intracranial complications secondary to OM over a 7-year period were identified. A retrospective chart review was undertaken at Beaumont University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Clinical presentation, radiological findings, microbiology, surgical management, and antibiotic use were studied. We compare our findings to those of other international investigators. RESULTS: Twelve cases were identified. Five had brain abscesses, 4 had lateral sinus thrombosis, and 3 had petrous apicitis. Eight of these cases were secondary to chronic OM and 4 were secondary to acute OM. Malodorous otorrhea, otalgia, headache, fever, and vertigo were the primary symptoms. Anaerobic bacteria were the most commonly isolated organisms followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with cholesteatoma underwent modified radical or radical mastoidectomy, and those who did not have cholesteatoma underwent cortical mastoidectomy. Two brain abscesses were drained before mastoid surgery; 2 were drained after mastoid surgery and 1 at the same time as otologic surgery. All patients received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeted at individual culture and sensitivity results. The mortality rate was zero. CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation and the frequency of occurrence of intracranial complications are similar to those occurring 10 years ago. The choice of antibiotics should include adequate anaerobic cover. We recommend that otologic surgery be performed at the same time as intracranial surgery for patients with mature brain abscesses.
TI  - Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy combined with conventional endodontic treatment to eliminate root canal biofilm infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT), standard endodontic treatment and the combined treatment to eliminate bacterial biofilms present in infected root canals. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten single-rooted freshly extracted human teeth were inoculated with stable bioluminescent Gram-negative bacteria, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to form 3-day biofilms in prepared root canals. Bioluminescence imaging was used to serially quantify bacterial burdens. PDT employed a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) as the photosensitizer (PS) and 660-nm diode laser light delivered into the root canal via a 200-micro fiber, and this was compared and combined with standard endodontic treatment using mechanical debridement and antiseptic irrigation. RESULTS: Endodontic therapy alone reduced bacterial bioluminescence by 90% while PDT alone reduced bioluminescence by 95%. The combination reduced bioluminescence by >98%, and importantly the bacterial regrowth observed 24 hours after treatment was much less for the combination (P<0.0005) than for either single treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Bioluminescence imaging is an efficient way to monitor endodontic therapy. Antimicrobial PDT may have a role to play in optimized endodontic therapy.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro antibacterial studies on cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes with cloxacillin.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of cloxacillin (clox) complexes with divalent  metal ions [Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II)] is described. The nature of bonding of the chelated cloxacillin and the structures of the metal complexes have been elucidated on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data. In all the complexes, the cloxacillin acts as a uninegatively charged bidentate ligand with coordination involving the carboxylate-O and endocyclic-N of the beta-lactam ring. The new compounds have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (a), Klebsiella pneumonae (b), Proteus mirabilis (c), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (d), Salmonella typhi (e), Shigella dysentriae (f), Bacillus cereus (g), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (h), Staphylococcus aureus (j) and Streptococcus pyogenes (k) bacterial strains. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. All compounds, respectively, showed a promising activity (90%) against five bacterial species at 10 microg/ml concentration and a significant activity (52%) against the same test bacteria at 25 microg/ml concentration.
TI  - [Characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  - War wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. Wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. War wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. This environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. War wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. The infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. Time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. Apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection. These are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. The determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. The etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family Enterobacteriacea (Escherichia coil, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus - A. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods Clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods Bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; Peptostreptococcus spp and Peptococcus spp. The latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. Early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. The choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. It is used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. The characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. The use of antibiotics is not a substitution for surgical treatment. The expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. If the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. The keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.
TI  - Increased serum IgA and IgM against LPS of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of CFS and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  - There is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. The present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of IgA and IgM to LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. Hafnia alvei; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas putida, Citrobacter koseri, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in CFS patients, patients with partial CFS and normal controls. We found that the prevalences and median values for serum IgA against the LPS of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with CFS than in normal volunteers and patients with partial CFS. Serum IgA levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the FibroFatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. The results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of CFS and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the LPS of gram-negative enterobacteria. It is suggested that all patients with CFS should be checked by means of the IgA panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.
TI  - Assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program on 3 continents.
AB  - Selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. Many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. The purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3 continents using data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. A total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. With a protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. Broth microdilution methods and current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria were used. The 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in North America (27.4%) and Europe (19.0%), but Escherichia coli was most common in Latin America (19.3%). All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from North America and Latin America were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. However, 2 S. pneumoniae strains from Italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/mL). Ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci were clonal. Numerous strains of Klebsiella spp. (22.5%), E. coli (4.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from Latin America and 1 from Europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 P. aeruginosa isolates from Turkey were resistant to polymyxin B (> or =4 microg/mL), and 8.7% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from Latin America were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. Therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age group.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.
TI  - Fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar--a differential medium for enteric bacteria.
AB  - Fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (FEBLA), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (LF) from non-lactose fermenters (NLF) in comparison with MacConkeys agar. Performance of FEBLA was at par with the latter. On FEBLA medium, the contrast between LF and NLF colonies was pronounced and Klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on MacConkeys agar (Hi Media). Unlike MacConkeys agar, a 24 h culture of K. pneumoniae cells on FEBLA were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. Escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. No change in cell morphology was evident with regard to Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter koseri and Acinetobacter baumannii. Performance of the medium was controlled using E. coli and S. flexneri. FEBLA is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2004). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2004 and July 2005. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. Of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. The strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (ABK), vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC) and VCM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (CZOP) and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or = 4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, CZOP, meropenem (MEPM), and carumonam (CRMN) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. Against Serratia marcescens, imipenem (IPM) and gentamicin (GM) had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. MEPM prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/mL. Next, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), CZOP, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/mL except IPM and MEPM having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activities of CZOP and CAZ were considered to be relatively good on MIC50 comparison (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - New trends in prosthesis infection in cardiovascular surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult cardiovascular surgery entails, in many cases, the use of some  kind of prosthesis. Among the potential complications, prosthetic device infection is one of the most devastating in incidence, as well as in prognosis and damage to surrounding tissues. RESULTS: The most common bacterial agents in vascular and cardiac prosthetic device infections are Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis among gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa among gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: The alternative modalities of treatment for prosthetic device infection encompass partial or total explantation of the prosthesis and its replacement with an infection-resistant graft (e.g., homologous tissue, autologous tissue, or synthetic prosthesis bonded with antibiotics).
TI  - [Clinical effect of continuous infusion of meropenem on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly].
AB  - We studied the clinical effect of continuous infusion over 24 hours of meropenem  (MEPM) on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly (over 65). The subjects were 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, n = 9; severe, n= 4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, n = 13) whose performance status was 3 or 4. MEPM 1.0g/day was infused continuously for 7-14 days, and its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and side effects were examined prospectively. It was effective in 23 of the 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, 8/9; severe, 3/4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, 12/13; efficacy rate: 88.5%). Bactericidal effects were obtained in 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphlococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis, but not in 2 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain of Serratia marcescens. Mild abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 2 patients: elevation of GPT, gamma-GTP, BUN and elevation of ALP. Based on the above, continuous infusion of MEPM on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly obtained excellent clinical effects. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of MEPM.
TI  - In vitro activities of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against bacterial pathogens isolated from Intensive Care Units in Taiwan: SMART 2004 programme data.
AB  - We investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against Gram-negative bacterial isolates from Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in Taiwan. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from ICUs of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. Sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam concentration of 4 mg/L and 8 mg/L or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. Piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/L concentration of sulbactam had better activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/L (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/L for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/L for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). For Acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/L sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. Adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant P. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and A. baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/L concentration of sulbactam) isolates. Results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam are dependent on the method used. Piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.
TI  - Gram-negative bacteria from patients seeking medical advice in Stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe.
AB  - Microbiological cultures from 229 patients seeking medical advice in Stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe of December 2004 were analysed at the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Gram-negative bacilli were the most common findings from wound cultures. Common human pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. More rare species of Gram-negative bacilli, e.g. Myroides odoratus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Bergeyella zoohelcum were also isolated. Resistance towards ordinary antibiotics was more extensive compared to our Swedish reference material for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Acinetobacter spp., but not for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, probably reflecting that the resistant isolates were nosocomially acquired in Asia.
TI  - Effectiveness of flouroquinolone therapy for gram-negative infections within the  intensive care unit setting.
AB  
TI  - Using interrupted time series analysis to assess associations of fluoroquinolone  formulary changes with susceptibility of gram-negative pathogens and isolation rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The use of fluoroquinolones has been linked to increasing bacterial resistance and infection and/or colonization with already resistant pathogens both as a risk factor and based on volume of use. Changes in individual fluoroquinolones used in an institution may also be related to these clinical problems. Interrupted time series analysis, which allows for assessment of the associations of an outcome attributable to a specific event in time, was used to study the effect of changes in our hospital's fluoroquinolone formulary on fluoroquinolone susceptibility rates in select gram-negative pathogens and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolation rate. Susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin were considered for the period of 1993 through 2004, while the MRSA isolation rate was assessed from 1995 through 2004. Levofloxacin was added to the formulary in 1999, and gatifloxacin was substituted for levofloxacin in 2001. Statistically significant changes in the already declining rates of susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P, 0.042) and Escherichia coli (P, 0.004) to ciprofloxacin and in the already rising MRSA isolation rate (P, 0.001) were associated with the addition of levofloxacin to the formulary. Substitution of gatifloxacin for levofloxacin on the formulary was associated with reversals in the downward trend in E. coli susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and the upward trend in MRSA isolation rate. No associations were detected on susceptibility of Klebsiella pneumoniae or Proteus mirabilis to ciprofloxacin. These findings suggest that potential changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and isolation of MRSA may vary by both drug and organism.
TI  - Antibacterial and antioxidant activities in Sideritis italica (Miller) Greuter et Burdet essential oils.
AB  - Sideritis italica (Miller) Greuter et Burdet is a widespread Lamiacea in the Mediterranean region used in traditional medicine. Essential oils were antibacterial against nine ATCC and as many clinically isolated Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Antibacterial activity was also found against Helicobacter pylori: a dose-dependant inhibition was shown between 5 and 25 microg/ml. The antibacterial activity of the oils was expressed as MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) and MBCs (minimum bactericidal concentrations). At a concentration between 3.9 and 250 microg/ml the oils showed a significant antibacterial effect against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In particular the ATCC strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC=3.9 microg/ml and 7.8 for flowerheads and leaves, respectively), Proteus mirabilis (MIC=15.6 and 7.8 microg/ml), Salmonella typhi (MIC=7.8 microg/ml) and Proteus vulgaris (MIC=15.6 microg/ml) were the most inhibited. Only Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed MBC at a concentration between 62.6 and 125 microg/ml. The antioxidant activity of the essential oils was evaluated by two cell free colorimetric methods: ABTS and DMPD; leaf oil is more active (4.29 +/- 0.02 trolox equivalents and 4.53 +/- 0.67 ascorbic acid equivalents by ABTS and DMPD, respectively). Finally the antioxidant activity of the essential oils was also evaluated by their effects on human whole blood leukocytes (WB) and on isolated polymorphonucleate (PMN) chemiluminescence. Comparing the effects of the oils from leaves and flowerheads on both PMN and WB chemiluminescence emission, we found no significant differences. Essential oils showed a dose-dependent and linear inhibitory activity on isolated PMN as well as on WB CL emission when PMA-stimulated. On the contrary, the inhibitory activity on resting cells was nonlinear. Our data represent an answer to the continual demand for new antibiotics and antioxidants for the continuous emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains and the growing interest in the substitution of synthetic antioxidants with natural ones. Furthermore, our finding of antibacterial and antioxidant activities in the essential oils from Sideritis italica flowerheads and leaves validated the use of the plant for medical purposes.

AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with ZnCl2, CdCl2 and HgCl2 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. HgII complexes have a considerably higher antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms. Some HgII complexes show higher antifungal activity than clotrimazole toward C. albicans. Zn2(L3)Cl4, Zn2(L4)Cl4, and Cd(L3)Cl2 were moderately effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis; Cd(L4)Cl2 exhibited a weak activity only against S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2-ethanediols, 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2,3,4-butanetetraols and their FeIII, CuII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with FeCl3, CuCl2, and AgNO3 were synthesized; antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some AgI complexes show higher activity toward S. epidermidis than AgNO3 and cefuroxime. Cu(L3)Cl2 and Fe(L3)Cl3 show an antifungal effect on C. albicans but L3 itself has no activity.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of BacT/ALERT 3D and BACTEC systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare BacT/ALERT (BTA) and BACTEC 9240 (BAC), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented BTA and BAC standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. The time to growth detection (TD) was recorded for each bottle that became positive. A quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess TD of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. RESULTS: A total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both BTA and BAC bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by BTA bottles and 13 (56.5%) by BAC. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the BTA system. The average TDs were 19.0 and 24.6 h for BTA and BAC, respectively. Analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa but slightly different for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The anaerobic bottle ofthe BTA did not support the growth of H. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) CFU/ml whereas the BAC did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml. TD for S. pneumoniae in the BTA was about half of that in the BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The BTA system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the BAC system to detect the same organism.
TI  - The anti-microbial activity of electrolysed oxidizing water against microorganisms relevant in veterinary medicine.
AB  - Standards of the German Association of Veterinary Medicine (DVG) for the evaluation of chemical disinfectants were used to assess the anti-microbial efficacy of electrolysed oxidizing water (EOW). Enterococcus faecium, Mycobacterium avium subspecies avium, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans were exposed to anode EOW (pH, 3.0+/-0.1; oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), +1100+/-50 mV; free chlorine, 400+/-20 mg/l Cl2) and combined EOW (7:3 anode:cathode, v/v; pH, 8.3+/-0.1; ORP, 930-950 mV; free chlorine, 271+/-20 mg/l Cl2). In water of standardized hardness (WSH), all bacterial strains were completely inactivated by a 30 min exposure to maximum 10.0% anode EOW (approximately 40.0 mg/l Cl2) or 50.0% combined EOW (approximately 135.5 mg/l Cl2). The sensitivity ranking order for anode EOW to the bacterial test strains was P. mirabilis>S. aureus>M. avium ssp. avium>E. faecium>P. aeruginosa. P. mirabilis and S. aureus decreased to undetectable levels after 5 min of exposure to 7.5% anode EOW (approximately 30.0 mg/l Cl2). Candida albicans was completely inactivated by a 5-min exposure to 5.0% anode EOW. Both, anode and combined EOW exhibited no anti-microbial activities in standardized nutrient broth or after addition of 20.0% bovine serum to the WSH. Further research is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of EOW as a disinfectant under operating conditions in animal production facilities.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial and anticonvulsant activities of some new 3-[2- (5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl/4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl) imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-ones and investigation of their structure-activity relationships.
AB  - In the present study, 20 new compounds having 3-[2-(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)  imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-one (I-XII) and 3-[2-(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino-4-thiazoldinon-5-ylidenel-5-substitute d/nonsubstituted IH-indole-2-one (XIII-XX) systems were synthesized. The structures were confirmed by spectral methods (UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 13C-DEPT (135), electron impact mass spectrometry) and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Microsporum gypseum (NCPF-580), Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum and some of them were found to be active. Especially, compound I was more active than cefuroxime sodium (CAS 56238-63-2) which was used as a standard, and the activity of compound XII was close to that of cefuroxime sodium against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. Primary screening for antituberculous activity was conducted at 6.25 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in BACTEC 12B medium using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The anticonvulsant activities of selected prototoype compounds (I, IV-VI, VIII, XI, XIII, XVI-XVIII) administered at doses of 50-200 mg/kg (i.p.) were evaluated using the pentetrazol test (PTZ) in mice.
TI  - Use of chitosan bandage to prevent fatal infections developing from highly contaminated wounds in mice.
AB  - HemCon bandage is an engineered chitosan acetate preparation used as a hemostatic control dressing, and its chemical structure suggests that it should also be antimicrobial. We tested its ability to rapidly kill bacteria in vitro and in mouse models of infected wounds. We used the Gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis and the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus that had all been stably transduced with the entire bacterial lux operon to allow in vivo bioluminescence imaging. An excisional wound in Balb/c mice was inoculated with 50-250 million cells followed after 30 min by application of HemCon bandage, alginate sponge bandage, silver sulfadiazine cream or no treatment. HemCon was more adhesive to the wound and conformed well to the injury compared to alginate. Animal survival was followed over 15 days with observations of bioluminescence emission and animal activity daily. Chitosan acetate treated mice infected with P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis all survived while those receiving no treatment, alginate and silver sulfadiazine demonstrated 25-100% mortality. Chitosan acetate was much more effective than other treatments in rapidly reducing bioluminescence in the wound consistent with its rapid bactericidal activity in vitro as well as its light-scattering properties. S. aureus formed only non-lethal localized infections after temporary immunosuppression of the mice but HemCon was again more effective in reducing bioluminescence. The data suggest that chitosan acetate rapidly kills bacteria in the wound before systemic invasion can take place, and is superior to alginate bandage and silver sulfadiazine that may both encourage bacterial growth in the short term.
TI  - Determination of usnic acid in some Rhizoplaca species from Middle Anatolia and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Three species of lichens, Rhizoplaca chrysoleuca (Sm.) Zopf, Rhizoplaca melanopthalma (DC.) Leuckert & Poelt and Rhizoplaca peltata Ramonds Leuckert, were collected from middle Anatolia, Erciyes Mountain (Kayseri) in Turkey. Their usnic acid amounts were determined by HPLC in acetone extracts. In addition, antimicrobial activities of these extracts were determined against Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Enterococcus faecalis (RSKK 508), Proteus mirabilis (Pasteur Ens. 235), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was shown that, as the usnic acid amount increased, the antimicrobial activities increased too. The usnic acid contents of Rhizoplaca species varied between 0.19-4.0% dry weight.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Bacteriological urinalysis in patients after renal transplantation.
AB  - The study consisted of microbiological urinalysis performed in 269 patients after renal transplantation who remained under medical care at the Outpatient Service of the Transplantation Institute in Warsaw. The patients enrolled into the study had undergone renal transplantation 6 to 72 months before urine samples were collected. 304 urinalysis were performed. In the group of 269 patients, 42 individuals had bacteria in their urine what was confirmed in 47 urine cultures. Cases of bacteriuria were divided into 5 groups: 5 cases of symptomatic urinary tract infection (5 individuals--2% of all studied patients), 27 cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria in 22 individuals (8% of all studied patients), 5 cases of insignificant bacteriuria in 5 patients (2%), 10 cases of involuntary urine contamination in 10 cases (4%). Eventually, urinary tract infection (UTI) was established in 27 patients (5 cases of symptomatic UTI and 22 cases of asymptomatic UTI) what makes out for 10% of all studied patients. In cases where urinalysis showed significant bacteriuria, following pathogens were detected in urine cultures: Escherichia coli: 22 strains, Enterococcus faecalis--4 strains, Enterobacter cloacae--2 strains and 1 strains of Ralstonia picketii, Streptococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Over 90% of Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, as well as to amikacin and aztreonam which are the drugs usually administered intravenously in hospitalized patients. The only drug of similar efficacy, which could be administered orally in outpatients was fosfomycin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - Global assessment of the antimicrobial activity of polymyxin B against 54 731 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli: report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance programme (2001-2004).
AB  - In total, 54 731 Gram-negative bacilli isolated worldwide between 2001 and 2004 from diverse sites of infection were tested for susceptibility to polymyxin B by the broth reference microdilution method, with interpretation of results according to CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. Polymyxin B showed excellent potency and spectrum against 8705 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2621 Acinetobacter spp. isolates (MIC50, < or = 1 mg/L and MIC90, 2 mg/L for both pathogens). Polymyxin B resistance rates were slightly higher for carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (2.7%) and Acinetobacter spp. (2.8%), or multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa (3.3%) and Acinetobacter spp. (3.2%), when compared with the entire group (1.3% for P. aeruginosa and 2.1% for Acinetobacter spp.). Among P. aeruginosa, polymyxin B resistance rates varied from 2.9% in the Asia-Pacific region to only 1.1% in Europe, Latin America and North America, while polymyxin B resistance rates ranged from 2.7% in Europe to 1.7% in North America and Latin America among Acinetobacter spp. Polymyxin B also demonstrated excellent activity (MIC90, < or = 1 mg/L; > 98% susceptible) against Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., but activity was more variable against Enterobacter spp. (MIC50, < or = 1 mg/L; 83.3% susceptible) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC50, < or = 1 mg/L; 72.4% susceptible), and was very limited (MIC50, > 8 mg/L) against Burkholderia cepacia (11.8% susceptible), Serratia spp. (5.4% susceptible), indole-positive Proteus spp. (1.3% susceptible) and Proteus mirabilis (0.7% susceptible).
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Biodegradation and decolourization of anaerobically treated distillery spent wash by a novel bacterial consortium.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate microorganisms capable of decolourizing and  degrading anaerobically treated distillery spent wash. A bacterial consortium DMC comprising of three bacterial cultures was selected on the basis of rapid effluent decolourization and degradation, which exhibited 67 +/- 2% decolourization within 24 h and 51 +/- 2% chemical oxygen demand reduction within 72 h when incubated at 37 degrees C under static condition in effluent supplemented with 0.5% glucose, 0.1% KH(2)PO(4), 0.05% KCl and 0.05% MgSO(4) x 7H(2)O. Addition of organic or inorganic nitrogen sources did not support decolourization. The cultures were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Stenotrophomonas maltophila and Proteus mirabilis by the 16S rDNA analysis.
TI  - Mechanical transmission of pathogenic organisms: the role of cockroaches.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Cockroaches (Diploptera punctata) are basically tropical insects and will do their best to find a home that is both warm and moist. Their involvement in the transmission of tropical diseases is poorly investigated in Africa. METHODS: A study on the bacterial, fungal and parasitic profile of cockroaches trapped in and around houses in Ekpoma was carried out using standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: Of a total of 234 cockroaches trapped from different sites (toilets, parlours, kitchens and bedrooms) in houses with pit latrines and water system, the bacterial, fungal and parasitic isolates were identical irrespective of the site, these included: E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serretia marcescens, S. aureus, S. feacalis, S. epidermidis, Aeromonas sp, Candida sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus sp, Mucor sp, cysts of E. hystolitica, oocysts of C. parvum, C. cayetenensis and Isospora belli, cysts of Balantidium coli, ova of Ascaris lumbricoides, Anchylostoma deodunalae, Enterobius vermicularis, ova Trichuris trichura, larva of Strongyloides stercoralis. Cockroaches trapped in the toilets of houses with pit latrines had a mean bacterial and parasites count of 12.3 x 10(10) org/ml and 98 parasites/ml respectively, while those trapped in the houses with water system had a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 89.5 x 10(7) org/ml and 31 parasites/ml respectively. A bacterial count of 78.9 x 10(7) org/ml was recorded from cockroaches trapped from the kitchens of houses with pit latrines. On the other hand a mean bacterial and parasitic count of 23.7 x 10(6) org/ml and 19 parasites/ml were recorded from kitchens of houses with water system. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Cockroaches represent an important reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of cockroaches will substantially minimise the spread of infectious diseases in our environment.
TI  - Use of electrochemical DNA biosensors for rapid molecular identification of uropathogens in clinical urine specimens.
AB  - We describe the first species-specific detection of bacterial pathogens in human  clinical fluid samples using a microfabricated electrochemical sensor array. Each of the 16 sensors in the array consisted of three single-layer gold electrodes-working, reference, and auxiliary. Each of the working electrodes contained one representative from a library of capture probes, each specific for a clinically relevant bacterial urinary pathogen. The library included probes for Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterocococcus spp., and the Klebsiella-Enterobacter group. A bacterial 16S rRNA target derived from single-step bacterial lysis was hybridized both to the biotin-modified capture probe on the sensor surface and to a second, fluorescein-modified detector probe. Detection of the target-probe hybrids was achieved through binding of a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody to the detector probe. Amperometric measurement of the catalyzed HRP reaction was obtained at a fixed potential of -200 mV between the working and reference electrodes. Species-specific detection of as few as 2,600 uropathogenic bacteria in culture, inoculated urine, and clinical urine samples was achieved within 45 min from the beginning of sample processing. In a feasibility study of this amperometric detection system using blinded clinical urine specimens, the sensor array had 100% sensitivity for direct detection of gram-negative bacteria without nucleic acid purification or amplification. Identification was demonstrated for 98% of gram-negative bacteria for which species-specific probes were available. When combined with a microfluidics-based sample preparation module, the integrated system could serve as a point-of-care device for rapid diagnosis of urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Rare bacteria species found in wounds of tsunami patients. Predominance of gram-negative rods, increased antibiotic resistance].
AB  - Microbiological cultures from 229 patients seeking medical advise in Stockholm after the tsunami catastrophe December 2004 were analysed at the Clinical microbiology laboratory, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Gram-negative rods were the most common findings from wound cultures. Common human pathogens as Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Klebsiella spp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. However, more rare species of gram-negative rods were also isolated, e.g. Myroides odoratus, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Bergeyella zoohelcum. Resistance towards ordinary antibiotics was higher compared to our Swedish reference material for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Acinetobacter spp, but not for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Possibly, this reflects that the resistant isolates were nosocomially acquired in Asia.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated organisms in Taiwan.
AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other comparators against 861 bacterial isolates recovered from patients treated in three major teaching hospitals in 2003. MICs to antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. High rates of oxacillin resistance (58%) in Staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), and vancomycin resistance (21%) and quinupristin-dalfopristin non-susceptibility (39%) in Enterococcus faecium (34 isolates) were found. Carbapenems had excellent in vitro activities (>or=98% susceptibility) against the 419 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, with the MIC(50) and MIC(90) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem being 0.25 and 4 mg/L, 0.03 and 0.12 mg/L, and 0.03 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. For, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (74 isolates) and Burkholderia cepacia (21 isolates), meropenem (MIC(90), 0.25, 2, and 4 mg/L, respectively) had better in vitro activities than imipenem (MIC(90), 8, 4, and 32 mg/L, respectively) and ertapenem (MIC(90), 0.5, >32, and 32 mg/L, respectively). Isepamicin had a similar activity with amikacin against all Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B. cepacia, and Acinetobacter baumannii, except for C. freundii isolates in which isepamicin had an eight-fold activity better than amikacin. Tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against all isolates tested (MIC(90), <or=1 mg/L) including 14 pandrugresistant A. baumannii isolates (MICs, 1-4 mg/L), except for Proteus mirabilis (59 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), Bacteroides fragilis (60 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC(90), 16 mg/L), and B. cepacia (21 isolates; MIC(90), 16 mg/L). Tigecycline, carbapenems, and isepamicin exhibited better or comparable in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of commonly encountered bacteria than other comparator antimicrobials and may represent therapeutic options for infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Assessment of antibacterial activity of some topical otological solutions.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Otological solutions have long been used in the treatment of the bacterial and fungal infections of the ear. We investigated antibacterial activity of some otic solutions against the most common bacteria isolated from discharging ears. STUDY DESIGN: Three solutions were used (Castellani's, Burrow's, and 2% salicyl alcohol) for 20 fresh isolates of each of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter spp.. The activity of each solution was determined by the size of the zone of inhibition of bacterial growth. RESULTS: The Castellani's solution showed significantly larger average inhibition zones than the other solutions did (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The Castellani's solution may be considered a good option against bacterial or mixed infections (bacterial and fungal) of the ear.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. METHODS: Models of the catheterized bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. HPLC was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. RESULTS: When catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/L) the formation of catheter biofilm by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis was prevented. The numbers of Enterococcus faecalis and Providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. Only P. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. Concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/L of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by P. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. It had little effect on urease-producing P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens or M. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of the successive or staggered use of eardrops.
AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media is still a significant health problem. Several topical agents such as antibacterials, steroids and acid media eardrops are widely used alone or in combination to control active otorrhea and obtain a dry ear. Patients frequently ask if there is any benefit or loss in the effect of these due to their use in a successive or staggered manner. This question led us to design this in vitro study to investigate the effect of the acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate on the antimicrobial effects of some ototopical antibiotics during their successive or staggered usage. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli were used for testing the antimicrobial activities of the selected antibiotic drops. Six microliters of acetic acid solution and dexamethasone sodium phosphate were used alone or together with 6 microl each of ciprofloxacin HCl, tobramycin and ofloxacin solution. Drops were placed on Whatman no. 1 paper disks with a diameter of 6 mm, and the disks were placed onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates on which bacteria had been swabbed over the entire surface. After overnight incubation of the plates at 35 degrees C, the diameters of the inhibition zones were recorded. There was no antibacterial effect in response to either acid solution or dexamethasone used alone. The inhibition zones of the antibiotics did not change with either steroid or acid media solution added onto the antibiotic disks alone or together. Acid solution or steroids should be preferred to use in combination with antibacterial otic drugs in in-vivo settings; no negative or positive effects were seen in in-vitro conditions. Therefore, prescribed eardrops can be used in a successive or staggered manner without any influence on the treatment results.
TI  - Microbiology of dacryocystitis among adults population in southern Australia.
AB  - Retrospective study on microbiology of dacryocystitis cases in adults was carried out at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (RVEEH). Sixty-four consecutive cases seen between March 2000 and June 2003 were included. Seventy-nine organisms were isolated from the sixty-six samples (1.2/specimen). Aerobic or facultative bacteria were recovered in 76 (96.2), fungi from two specimens (2.5%). And anaerobic bacteria from only one specimen (1.3%). Staphylococcus aureus (27), was most common followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6), Proteus mirabilis (4), Hemophilus parainfluenza (4) and H. influenza (4). Fifty-four samples showed single organism while 12 samples showed multiple organisms. Overall, Gram-positive organisms were predominating (54.4%) over Gram negative (41.8%) organisms. The current bacteriology of lacrimal duct obstruction in the population served by the RVEEH should be taken into account while selecting first line antimicrobial treatment for dacryocystitis and in prophylaxis in lacrimal drainage surgery.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Granulomatous inflammation of salt glands in ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) associated with intralesional Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The "nasal glands" occur in many bird species and are powerful sodium ion-excretory organs. In ducks, they are located in supraorbital bony recesses. Granulomatous inflammation of these glands occurs with an incidence of approximately 1% in ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos), and is not associated with specific clinical symptoms. We investigated nine glands of eight animals with granulomas by gross pathology and histopathology, and compared results of bacteriology with 20 non-lesioned nasal glands. Adenitis was characterized by multifocal to coalescent heterophilic granulomas with central necrotic heterophils, and multinucleate giant cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells. Within the centres of the granulomas, there were clusters of Gram-negative bacteria that were identified as halo-tolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Aeromonas hydrophila. Normal glands contained exclusively various halo-tolerant Gram-positive bacteria, mostly Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus sp. The distribution of lesions and lack of clinical symptoms were suggestive of a localized ascending infection via the secretory ductules.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of leg ulcer bacterial flora in patients hospitalized at Dermatology Department, Poznan University Hospital.
AB  - Effective treatment of frequently infected, poorly healing wounds such as leg ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency poses a major clinical problem. Antibiotic resistance in dermatology patients, especially those with non-healing leg ulcers, is a widespread phenomenon. Various antibiotics, mainly broad-spectrum agents, are frequently and sometimes inappropriately prescribed, which often leads to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. The aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of bacterial isolates cultured from leg ulcers. Wound swabs were obtained from patients admitted to Dermatology Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period. Bacteriologic diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. The analysis yielded 173 positive results, predominated by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics, taking into consideration the presence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between the years 1998 and 2002, with detailed account of clinical characteristics and history of leg ulcers disease. The study pointed to an increasing tendency of antibiotic resistance in the study group of patients.
TI  - Bacterial flora of leg ulcers in patients admitted to Department of Dermatology,  Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period.
AB  - Venous leg ulcers are an important cause of morbidity in a significant percentage of the world population. The percentage of leg ulceration, either active or healed, in the European population is about 1%-2%. The aim of this study was to analyze the rate of colonization and qualitative composition of the bacterial flora isolated from leg ulcers in patients admitted to Dermatology Department, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, during the 1998-2002 period, with special reference to the infection risk factors. Bacteriological diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. In 173 positive results, the predominant culture composition included Staphylococcus aureus (56.57%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (37.14%), Enterococcus faecalis (22.29%), Proteus mirabilis (13.71%) and Escherichia coli (12.57%). There was a significant increase in the incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, along with a decrease in the incidence of Staphylococcus aureus isolation during the study period. The rate of yeast-like fungi strains, mainly Candida albicans, recorded in culture composition showed a systematic increase. Changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of bacterial flora, presence of multiple isolates, and concomitant diseases that may influence the characteristics of leg ulcer disease were closely monitored.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata Cav. ethanolic extracts.
AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate antibacterial activity of Zuccagnia punctata ethanolic extract against 47 strains of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and to identify bioactive compounds. Inhibition of bacterial growth was investigated using agar diffusion, agar macrodilution, broth microdilution and bioautographic methods. Zuccagnia punctata extract was active against all assayed bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 25 to 200 microg/mL. Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were identical or two-fold higher than the corresponding MIC values. Contact bioautography, indicated that Zuccagnia punctata extracts possess one major antibacterial component against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and at least three components against. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Activity-guided fractionation of 1he ethanol extract on a silica gel column yielded a compound (2',4'-dihydroxychalcone), which exhibited strong antibacterial activity with MIC values between 0.10 and 1.00 microg/mL for Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. These values are lower than imipenem (0.25-16 microg/mL). Zuccagnia punctata might provide promising therapeutic agents against infections with multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  - The reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. New derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such as, O-glycidylketoxime (4) and O-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. Alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted N-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. The syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. All of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-O-[2-hydroxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against S. aureus ATCC 6538. The compounds 2, 5b, 6b, 6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. Similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-O-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. None of the other compounds exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Potency and spectrum of tigecycline tested against an international collection of bacterial pathogens associated with skin and soft tissue infections (2000-2004).
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of tigecycline, a novel glycylcycline, was evaluated against 5289 bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients with skin and soft tissue infections during 2000-2004. Strains were submitted from >70 medical centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe, and were tested centrally using reference broth microdilution methods. The top 10 ranking pathogens (95% of total) recovered included Staphylococcus aureus (55.2%), Enterococcus spp. (9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%), Escherichia coli (5.6%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (5.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (4.9%), Enterobacter spp. (2.8%), Klebsiella spp. (2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (1.7%), and indole-positive Proteae (1.2%). All staphylococci (S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci), enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and E. coli were inhibited by < or =2 microg/mL of tigecycline; in addition, 97% of Klebsiella spp., 95% of Enterobacter spp., and 97% of Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited at this concentration. Only P. aeruginosa and all Proteae (MIC90, 16 microg/mL) displayed elevated MIC values to tigecycline. The broad spectrum of activity exhibited by this glycylcycline included tetracycline-resistant organism subsets, as well as oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enteric bacilli strains. Tigecycline represents a new choice among broad-spectrum parenteral agents for the common Gram-positive and -negative pathogens producing serious infections of skin and soft tissues.
TI  - Effects of lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria on the level of thiols in blood platelets.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, LPS) activates blood platelets and stimulates generation of free radicals in these cells. The mechanism of platelet activation induced by LPS is not known. The aim of the present study was to examine how glutathione (GSH) and other thiol-containing compounds are involved in the oxidative stress in blood platelets caused by LPS. The HPLC technique has been used on the analysis of non-protein thiols from human blood platelets treated with lipopolysaccharides of different gram-negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Our results show that LPSs caused an increase (about 10%) of the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) and other nonprotein thiols such as cysteine (CSH) and cysteinylglycine (CGSH), whereas the total pool of these compounds was almost unchanged. LPS may react directly with thiols, since after incubation of LPSs with glutathione alone (in reduced form) we observed a distinct decrease of the level of platelet GSH.
TI  - Fatal herpes simplex virus infection in Darier disease under corticotherapy.
AB  - A 67-year-old man is presented with longstanding and severe Darier disease treated by topical antiseptics and potent corticosteroids, in combination with oral glucocorticoids and etretinate. After cardiac bypass surgery in 1997, the patient experienced herpes simplex virus (HSV type-1) infection of the skin that was treated by intravenous aciclovir. In 2003, he presented a widespread atypical exacerbation of his Darier disease, involving the face, trunk, buttocks, intertriginous areas and arms. Initial clinical signs and bacteriological findings suggested a bacterial involvement by multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Despite antibiotherapy, the clinical presentation progressively worsened. A skin biopsy was performed and immunohistochemical examination identified a type-2 HSV infection. Although intravenous aciclovir was administered, the widespread cutaneous HSV infection was followed by systemic dissemination. A severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed, leading to a fatal issue. At autopsy, a severe interstitial type-2 HSV pneumonitis with extensive necrotic areas was found, in association with gastro-intestinal involvement. This case represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of Darier disease presenting a fatal type-2 HSV infection. It underlines the importance of rapidly recognizing HSV infection in Darier disease and stresses the risk of lethal outcome. The different risk factors for HSV infection in this patient are reviewed.
TI  - Antibacterial and antioxidant activities of ethanol extract from Paullinia cupana Mart.
AB  - The antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the ethanol extract from Paullinia  cupana var. sorbilis Mart. (Sapindaceae) seeds, commonly called guarana, was assessed towards selected bacteria as well as in different antioxidant models. The extract, at a concentration between 16 and 128 microg/ml, showed a significant antibacterial effect expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC=16 microg/ml), Proteus mirabilis (MIC=32 microg/ml), Proteus vulgaris (MIC=32 microg/ml) and Escherichia coli (MIC=32 microg/ml) were the most inhibited. The antioxidant activity was determined by the malonyldialdehyde (MDA) test, measuring the MDA concentration in 3T3-L1 cells after induced cellular damage using ferric ammonium citrate (FAC). The reduction of lipid peroxidation was 62.5% using a guarana extract with a concentration of 2 microg/ml. This effect was dose/dependent. The ethanol extract from Paullinia cupana seeds was analysed by spectrophotometry to determine the concentration of catechol substances after treatment of the extract with p-aminophenol. The total phenolics content in the ethanol extract was also determined spectrophotometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The concentration of catechol equivalent was 6.06+/-0.13 mg/g (mean+/-S.D.), while the total phenolic content was 8.43+/-0.21 mg/g (mean+/-S.D.). The correlation index between antioxidant activity and catechol content was 0.96.
TI  - Aetiology of catheter-associated bacteriuria in Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
AB  - A prospective study to determine the causative agents of catheter-related bacteriuria was carried out on 99 patients with median age of 55 years, on admission in the Oncology, Paediatric Surgery and Obstetric and Gynaecology wards of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. There was significant bacteriuria in seventy-one (72%) of the 99 urine samples. All catheter urine samples were contaminated by day 5 Gram-negative bacilli were predominant (89.3%) of which Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.2%) was the most common, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes accounted for 15.5% each, closely followed by Proteus mirabilis (14.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%). The Gram positive isolates Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2.4%) made up only 10.7% of isolates. Most of the isolates from catheterised patients were resistant to the common antibiotics such as ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin and ceftriaxone with high susceptibility to ofloxacin and ceftazidime though the isolates of Enterococcus faecalis was also resistant to ofloxacin. However, isolates of S. saprophyticus were still susceptible to the penicillins and tetracycline.
TI  - Clinical management and outcome of childhood lung abscess: a 16-year experience.
AB  - In order to evaluate the clinical manifestations, management and outcome of childhood lung abscess, a retrospective chart review of 27 pediatric patients with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) code of 503.1 (lung abscess) from August 1987 to August 2003 was conducted. Among the 27 patients (14 males and 13 females), 30% (8/27) were primary lung abscess and 70% (19/27) had underlying chronic diseases (secondary lung abscess). The predisposing factors of the primary group (n = 8) included 6 cases of respiratory tract infection, 1 with choking during swimming, and 1 with laceration wound. The underlying diseases in the secondary group (n = 19) included 10 cases of hematologic disorder (52%), 3 of congenital heart disease, 2 of central nervous system anomalies, and 1 each of hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, chronic lung disease, liver cirrhosis with fistula formation, and Swyer-James syndrome. Eleven patients (41%) underwent diagnostic tapping, including echo-guided aspiration (10 cases) and computed tomography-guided percutaneous needle aspiration (1 case). Positive yield rate from aspiration of lung abscess was 63.6% (7/11). Surgical intervention was performed in 8 (42%) of the secondary group and in 1 patient from the primary group. The pathogens were identified in 11 patients (41%): 5 with oral flora, 2 with Staphylococcus aureus plus other pathogens, 1 with S. aureus alone, 1 with Pseudomonas aeruginosa plus Proteus mirabilis, 1 with P. aeruginosa alone, and 1 with Aspergillus. The average duration of parenteral antibiotic use was 40 days. Five cases (18.5%) died due to poor control of the underlying diseases, and 4 of the patients (15%) had sequelae (2 with bronchiectasis and 2 with lung fibrosis). Seventy percent of lung abscess occurred in children with underlying medical conditions. Early percutaneous aspiration has an important role in identification of pathogens. Oral anaerobes and S. aureus are the core pathogens in primary lung abscess and gram-negative pathogens should also be considered in secondary lung abscess.
TI  - Peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of Haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  - Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. We used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive NTHi strain R2866 (also called Int1). Over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward R2866 in a dose-dependent manner. Five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (KQRTSIRATEGCLPS; clone hi3/17), while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. All of the bactericidal phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. Clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of clinical NTHi isolates and H. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica) bacteria. These data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.
TI  - Noninvasive biophotonic imaging for monitoring of catheter-associated urinary tract infections and therapy in mice.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections acquired by humans, particularly in catheterized patients. A major problem with catheterization is the formation of bacterial biofilms on catheter material and the risk of developing persistent UTIs that are difficult to monitor and eradicate. To better understand the course of UTIs and allow more accurate studies of in vivo antibiotic efficacy, we developed a catheter-based biofilm infection model with mice, using bioluminescently engineered bacteria. Two important urinary tract pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, were made bioluminescent by stable insertion of a complete lux operon. Segments of catheter material (precolonized or postimplant infected) with either pathogen were placed transurethrally in the lumen of the bladder by using a metal stylet without surgical manipulation. The bioluminescent strains were sufficiently bright to be readily monitored from the outside of infected animals, using a low-light optical imaging system, including the ability to trace the ascending pattern of light-emitting bacteria through ureters to the kidneys. Placement of the catheter in the bladder not only resulted in the development of strong cystitis that persisted significantly longer than in mice challenged with bacterial suspensions alone but also required prolonged antibiotic treatment to reduce the level of infection. Treatment of infected mice for 4 days with ciprofloxacin at 30 mg/kg of body weight twice a day cured cystitis and renal infection in noncatheterized mice. Similarly, ciprofloxacin reduced the bacterial burden to undetectable levels in catheterized mice but did not inhibit rebound of the infection upon cessation of antibiotic therapy. This methodology easily allows spatial information to be monitored sequentially throughout the entire disease process, including ascending UTI, treatment efficacy, and relapse, all without exogenous sampling, which is not possible with conventional methods.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived Schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal Schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysentriae) and four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureous and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed Schiffs' bases. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of 2-amino-5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles and their evaluation for antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Twenty Schiff bases of 2-amino-5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles have been synthesized with different aromatic aldehydes. The structures of the compounds were confirmed by nitrogen analysis, IR and 13C-NMR spectral data. The antibacterial properties of the compounds were investigated against Proteus mirabilis (MTCC-425), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC-424), Bacillus subtilis (MTCC-619) and Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC-96) using the broth dilution method. The most active compounds were 4c (64 microg/ml), 4f (68 microg/ml), 4m (64 microg/ml) and 4q (62 microg/ml). The antifungal screening of the compounds were carried out using Aspergillus niger (MTCC-1344) and Candida albicans (MTCC-227) using the broth dilution method. Active compounds were 4g (52 microg/ml), 4h (56 microg/ml), 4l (60 microg/ml), 4m (58 microg/ml).
TI  - Bacteriological study of diabetic foot infections.
AB  - AIMS: The polymicrobial nature of diabetic foot infection has been well documented in the literature. Patients with diabetic foot infection not exposed to antibiotics are not well studied before. The relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from community-acquired foot infections that are not exposed to antimicrobial agents for 30 days is studied. In addition, the bacterial comparative in vitro susceptibility to the commonly used antibacterial agents is assessed. METHODS: This is a prospective study in which the infected wounds of 86 consecutive diabetic patients seen in the diabetic foot clinic in Adan Teaching Hospital were cultured when visiting the clinic. The patients did not receive antimicrobial therapy 30 days prior to taking the cultures. The specimen was cultured using aerobic and anaerobic microbiological techniques. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial therapy. RESULT: Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate, being recovered from 38.4% of cases. Other organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5%) and Proteus mirabilis (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (10.5%), mainly Bacteroides fragilis. Imipenem, meropenem, and cefepime were the most effective agents against gram-negative organisms. Vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive organisms. CONCLUSION: S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. Anaerobic organisms are still a common cause for infection, although the prevalence is less. These wounds may require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial management.
TI  - An ethnobotanical survey of Bauchi State herbal plants and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A survey of medicinal plants used locally in the treatment of various diseases was carried out in Bauchi State-Nigeria. A total of 84 medicinal plants were listed. Preliminary antimicrobial activity of the aqueous extracts of the plants was investigated. The results indicated that out of 84 plants, 75 exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more of the test organisms at a concentration of 200 mg/ml. The extracts were found to show potentially interesting activity against Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Childhood parapneumonic pleural effusion in Enugu.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiological pattern and clinical features, management and outcome of childhood parapneumonic pleural effusion in Enugu. METHODS: The records of the children with diagnosis of pleural effusion admitted at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu between January 1995 and February 2001 were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty out of forty two patients reviewed were analysed. There were 20 males, and 20 females (ratio of 1: 1), with age range of 3 months to 156 months (13 years) and the mean age of 4.99 years. The presenting symptoms were fever in 40 patients (100% ), cough in 38 (97.40% ), dyspnea in 36 (90.00% ), breathlessness in 27 (67.5% ), while, the most common physical sign was pallor. Thirty six children had diagnostic thoracocentesis. Twenty four (55.81% ) yielded pus, out of which, 10 grew organisms on culture; Streptococcus Pneumonia in 3, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, coliforms in 2, Haemophilus influenzae in 1, Proteus mirabilis in 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1. Nine patients received ampicillin/cloxacillin combination alone; 31 received ampicillin/cloxacillin with other antibiotics, including anti- tuberculous drugs in four children. Thirty-five of the children had thoracotomy, and one later had thoracotomy and decortication. Thirty-seven (92.5% ) were discharged home on recovery. The average admission duration was 24 days. Mortality rate was 7.50%. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, there appears to be an evolving change in epidemiological pattern in comparison with the previous study from this center. There is need to improve on the diagnostic procedure and treatment modalities in order to establish definite criteria for antibiotic use and surgical intervention.
TI  - [Resistance of catheter-associated urinary tract infections to antibacterials].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are the most common nosocomial infections. The worldwide data show the increasing resistance to conventional antibiotics among urinary tract pathogens. AIM: To evaluate the adequacy of initial antimicrobial therapy in relation to the antimicrobial resistance of pathogens responsible for CAUTI in Clinical Center of Banja Luka. METHODS: A retrospective study on major causes of CAUTI, antibiotic resistance and treatment principles was conducted at four departments of the Clinical Center of Banja Luka from January 1st, 2000 to April 1st, 2003. RESULTS: The results showed that 265 patients had developed CAUTI. The seven most commonly isolated microorganisms were, in descending order: E. coil (31.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%), Proteus mirabilis (12.9%), Gr. Klebsiella-Enterobacter (12.3%), Enterococcus spp. (5.2%), Pseudomonas spp. (4.3%), Serratia spp. (4.0%). The most common pathogens were highly resistant to ampicillin (64-100%), gentamycin (63-100%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (68-100%), while some bacterias, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. showed rates of ciprofloxacin resistance as high as 42.8% and 72.7%, respectively. In 55.5% of the cases, the initial antibiotic therapy was inadequate, and was corrected latter on. There were no standard therapeutic protocols for this type of nosocomial infections. CONCLUSION: The results of this study emphasized an urgency of the prevention and introduction of clinical protocols for better management of CAUTI. Treatment principles should better correspond to the antibiotic sensitivity of uropathogens.
TI  - Malignant mimickers: chronic bacterial and fungal infections of the larynx.
AB  - Chronic infections of the larynx are notorious "copycats" of squamous cell carcinoma. Patients typically present with a historical picture and symptoms identical to those seen in a neoplastic setting: dyspnea, hoarseness, odynophagia, weight loss, and a history of tobacco and alcohol abuse. Historically, these patients were subject to an extensive resection for what was in reality a benign disease. A better understanding and awareness of these conditions has reinforced the need for a direct laryngoscopy, biopsy, and culture in the evaluation of long-lasting laryngeal lesions; this has led to more appropriate and focused treatment. The clinical mimicry of chronic laryngeal infections will be illustrated in two recent case reports, histoplasmosis and botryomycosis of the larynx, which will lead into a discussion on the differential diagnosis of bacterial and fungal laryngeal infections, their evaluation, and treatment options.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - Chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely clarified. Using N-chlorotaurine (NCT), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. It was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. METHODS: Pathogens were incubated in NCT, which was subsequently washed off. The oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. RESULTS: Superficial chlorination in the form of covalent N-Cl bonds to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. For S. aureus, 3 min incubation with NCT produced a cover of 3.3 x 10(-16) mol Cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. The kind of microorganism, coating time, pH, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. The relative cover strength on S. aureus by NCT, chloramine T, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or N,N-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. Chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees C (>8 h at 1 degrees C), even without a reduction of cfu. However, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal NH(2)Cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. CONCLUSIONS: The chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. Furthermore, it may be a decisive step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.
TI  - (1)H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced urinary  tract infection.
AB  - The utility of (1)H NMR spectroscopy is suggested and demonstrated for the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urinary tract infection (UTI). The specific property of P. aeruginosa of metabolizing nicotinic acid to 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-OHNA) is exploited. The quantity of 6-OHNA produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize nicotinic acid under similar conditions. The method provides a single-step documentation of P. aeruginosa qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The NMR method is demonstrated on urine samples from 30 patients with UTI caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of ibafloxacin in micro-organisms isolated from cats.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of ibafloxacin were investigated in micro-organisms isolated from cats. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ibafloxacin (racemate, R- and S-enantiomers) and its metabolites (7-hydroxy- and 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin) and time-kill kinetics were determined against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from dermal and respiratory and urinary tract infections in cats. Racemic ibafloxacin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria. Escherichia coli and Pasteurella, Klebsiella and Staphylococcus spp. are commonly isolated from feline infections and all are susceptible to ibafloxacin (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microg/mL), whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus spp. are considered intrinsic resistant. Microbiological activity resides primarily in the S-enantiomer of ibafloxacin whereas the R-enantiomer is less active. Killing curves using concentrations of racemic ibafloxacin and 8-hydroxy-ibafloxacin, which are representative of the in vivo situation observed in cats, showed at least 99.9% reduction in viable bacterial isolates from feline clinical samples over 24 h. Bacterial eradication was achieved in cats with Cmax/MIC and AUC/MIC values much lower than the target values previously established in man and laboratory animals. Additional studies in dogs and cats are necessary to define more clearly the surrogate markers of antibacterial activity (i.e. Cmax/MIC, AUC/MIC ratios), which are associated with a good clinical response.
TI  - Otomycoses of candidal origin in eastern Slovakia.
AB  - Mycological analysis of swabs and scraping samples from the external ear canals of 40 patients with clinically diagnosed otomycosis (10 neonates, 30 adults) revealed the presence of fungi as etiological agents. They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 21; 52.5 %), C. parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C. tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.
TI  - Longitudinal trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities across long-term-care facilities: emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance in the longterm-care facility (LTCF) setting is of increasing concern due to both the increased morbidity and mortality related to infections in this debilitated population and the potential for transfer of resistant organisms to other healthcare settings. Longitudinal trends in antibiotic resistance in LTCFs have not been well described. DESIGN: Correlational longitudinal survey study. SETTING: Four LTCFs in Pennsylvania. SUBJECTS: All clinical cultures of residents of the participating LTCFs (700 total beds) from 1998 through 2003. We assessed the annual prevalence of resistance to various antimicrobials of interest for the following organisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus species. RESULTS: A total of 4,954 clinical isolates were obtained during the study. A high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance was noted for many organism-drug combinations. This was especially true for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the Enterobacteriaceae (susceptibility range, 51.3% to 92.2%). In addition, the prevalence of resistance to various agents differed significantly across study sites. Finally, significant increasing trends in resistance were noted over time and were most pronounced for fluoroquinolone susceptibility among the Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance has increased significantly in LTCFs, although trends have varied substantially across different institutions. These trends have been particularly pronounced for fluoroquinolone resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae. These findings demonstrate that antimicrobial resistance is widespread and increasing in LTCFs, highlighting the need for future studies to more clearly elucidate the risk factors for, and potential interventions against, emerging resistance in these settings.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial activities of new nitrobutane derivatives.
AB  - It is known that some addition products of beta-nitrostyrenes exhibit potent antimicrobial activity. In order to investigate the effects of structural modifications on the biological properties, some new Michael type addition products of beta-ethyl-beta-nitrostyrenes were synthesized. In this study, eight new 1-[(2-aminophenyl)thio]-1-phenyl-2-nitrobutane (2) derivatives were synthesized by addition of 2-aminothiophenol to the double bond of beta-ethyl-beta-nitrostyrenes (1). The chemical structures were proved by IR and 1H-NMR data and by elemental analysis. Antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compound were investigated against Escherichia coil, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans by the microdilution method. In addition, the newly synthesized compounds were studied for antiviral activities. All of them were found to be almost 100 fold more active than the standard compound aciclovir (CAS 59277-89-3).
TI  - Rapid, species-specific detection of uropathogen 16S rDNA and rRNA at ambient temperature by dot-blot hybridization and an electrochemical sensor array.
AB  - Development of rapid molecular approaches for pathogen detection is key to improving treatment of infectious diseases. For this study, the kinetics and temperature-dependence of DNA probe hybridization to uropathogen species-specific sequences were examined. A set of oligonucleotide probes were designed based on variable regions of the 16S gene of the Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A universal bacterial probe and probes-specific for gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also included. The oligonucleotide probes discriminated among 16S genes derived from 11 different species of uropathogenic bacteria applied to nylon membranes in a dot-blot format. Significant binding of oligonucleotide probes to target DNA and removal of nonspecific binding by membrane washing could both be achieved rapidly, requiring as little as 10 min. An oligonucleotide probe from the same species-specific region of the E. coli 16S gene was used as a capture probe in a novel electrochemical 16-sensor array based on microfabrication technology. Sequence-specific hybridization of target uropathogen 16S rDNA was detected through horseradish peroxidase acting as an electrochemical transducer via a second, detector probe. The sensor array demonstrated rapid, species-specific hybridization in a time course consistent with the rapid kinetics of the dot-blot hybridization studies. As in the dot-blot hybridization studies, species-specific detection of bacterial nucleic acids using the sensor array approach was demonstrated both at 65 degrees C and at room temperature. These results demonstrate that molecular hybridization approaches can be adapted to rapid, room temperature conditions ideal for an electrochemical sensor array platform.
TI  - Intracranial complications of otitis media: 15 years of experience in 33 patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Complications in the central nervous system (CNS) from acute otitis media (AOM) and chronic otitis media (COM) are becoming fewer, although they still represent a challenge for early recognition, adequate treatment, and satisfactory results. This retrospective study analyzed clinical data and therapeutic options in 33 patients with intracranial involvement resulting from otitis media. Important clinical features of intracranial complications and the sequence of the most efficient therapeutic maneuvers are discussed. METHODS: Charts of six patients with AOM and 27 patients with COM associated with CNS complications were analyzed for clinical presentation, imaging, and therapeutic approach. RESULTS: Ages ranged from 6 months to 79 years, with no gender predilection. Persistent fever, headache, and purulent otorrhea were the main symptoms. Proteus mirabilis , Enterococcus , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common microorganisms in COM, and Pneumococcus and Haemophilus were the most common microorganisms in AOM. Nineteen patients (58%) presented with more than 1 CNS complication, resulting in a total of 56 complications, including 26 cases of otogenic brain abscess, 21 cases of meningitis, 5 cases of lateral sinus thromboses, two cases of subdural empyemas, 1 case of epidural empyema, and 1 case of meningocele. Surgical interventions included craniotomy and drainage of the abscess (n = 17), open mastoidectomy with abscess drained through the mastoid (n = 10), open mastoidectomy alone (n = 8), and closed mastoidectomy (n = 2). Twelve patients who underwent craniotomy had subsequent mastoidectomy for recurrent abscess. At the 6-month, 66% of patients presented without sequelae, 24% presented with sequelae, and 9% died. CONCLUSION: Early identification and prompt clinical and surgical intervention with mandatory drainage of the middle ear (primary disease), was essential for better outcome.
TI  - [Effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  - The effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; BACTEC 9240 system and BacT/ALERT 3D system. Total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and Candida parapsilosis which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. BACTEC 92F, 93F and BacT/ALERT FA, FN bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. All the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. All the bottles were subcultured. The effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in BACTEC 9240 system. The blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles inoculated with Escherichia coli. In Serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. In Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. On the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in BacT/ALERT 3 D system. The samples except part of Streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. These results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. Therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.
TI  - Endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy: Incidence, causative organisms, and  visual acuity outcomes.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence, causative organisms, and visual acuity outcomes associated with endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: The medical records were reviewed of all patients who developed acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis (within 6 weeks of surgery) after pars plana vitrectomy at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 2003. RESULTS: During the 20-year study interval, the overall incidence rate of postvitrectomy endophthalmitis was 0.039% (6/15,326). Cultured organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Proteus mirabilus (n = 1), and Staphylococcus epidermidis/Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1); one case was culture-negative. Visual acuity after treatment for endophthalmitis ranged from 2/200 to no light perception, with a final vision of light perception or no light perception in four of six (67%) eyes. CONCLUSION: The incidence of endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy is low but the visual acuity outcomes after treatment are generally poor.
TI  - The bacteriology of open fractures in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to determine the pattern of bacterial  isolates and antibiotic sensitivity profile in open fractures. Fifty-nine patients with open fractures of the lower limb long bones were studied. The majority of the cases were Gustilo and Anderson types II 21(35.6%), and IIIA 16(27.1%). METHOD: The patients were assessed by history taking, physical examination, and plain radiographs. Wound swabs were taken for bacteriological studies. Other necessary investigations were also done. During wound debridement open fractures were classified into Grades I, II and III using the Gustilo-Anderson method of classification. RESULTS: The infection rate was 45.8%. Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods were isolated. On the whole Staphylococcus aureus 13(25%), and Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) 14(26.9%), were the commonest organisms isolated. The commonest Gram-negative rods that were isolated from the wounds were Proteus mirabilis 9(17.3%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8(15.4%). Multiple organisms were commonly isolated from the wounds. While all the organisms isolated showed very good sensitivity to gentamicin, cloxacillin and ofloxacin, most of the organisms were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin and tetracycline. The sensitivity ranged from 62.5% to 100%. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CONS) showed sensitivity to the widest range of antibiotics which included penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, cloxacillin and ofloxacin. The sensitivity ranged from 35.7% to 100%. There was statistically significant difference between the open tibial and femoral fracture cases with respect to the interval between injury and debridement time (p = 0.008); the rate of wound infection (p = 0.021); and the occurrence of osteomyelitis (p = 0.023). The commonest complications observed were wound infection 27(45.8%), and delayed fracture union 26(44.1%), which were commoner in the open tibial fractures. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) were the commonest organisms associated with open fracture of the lower limbs in our centre and that delay in the initial wound debridement was a major predisposing factor to wound infection.
TI  - Traditional medicine in Sakarya province (Turkey) and antimicrobial activities of selected species.
AB  - Traditional medicine in North-West of Turkey (Sakarya province) were studied during a 2 months field study by interviewing local informants from several villages. Plant species used to treat infections were tested for antimicrobial activity. Information was collected for 46 plant species from 30 families and for 5 animal species. Twenty four of the plant species were cultivated. Most used families were Asteraceae, Cucurbitaceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae and the most used plants were Artemisia absinthium, Equisetum telmateia, Lavandula stoechas, Melissa officinalis, Tussilago farfara and Urtica dioica. A total of 139 medicinal uses were obtained. Plants are used mainly for infectious diseases (18%), for neurological and psychological disorders (13.7%), cardiovascular disorders (13%), skin disorders (12.2%) and respiratory disorders (10.1%). Extracts were tested in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231, using microbroth dilution technique according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). This research showed that Arum maculatum, Datura stramonium, Geranium asphodeloides and Equisetum telmateia petroleum ether extracts had MIC values of 39.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml and 39.1 microg/ml, respectively against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Datura stramonium petroleum ether extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli and Trachystemon orientalis ethanol extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial activity of Arum maculatum, Equisetum telmateia, Geranium asphodeloides, Plantago intermedia, Senecio vulgaris and Trachystemon orientalis has been reported here for the first time.
TI  - Otitis externa infection in Jordan. Clinical and microbiological features.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Aims of this study were to investigate the clinical findings and to identify causative microorganisms and their susceptibility to antibiotics in otitis externa infection. METHODS: The symptoms and signs, as well as the bacterial and fungal flora from the auditory canal of one hundred and eighty patients (100 males and 80 females), age range from 6 month to 19-years old suffering from acute otitis externa were studied from January 2001 to December 2002. One way ANOVA and Least Significant Difference (LSD) were carried out for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Pain was the most common symptom (97.2%) while, itching and difficulty in hearing were the least common (11.7 %). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa) was isolated from (41.7%) which showed the best susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (93.4%), aspergillus species from (19.4%), candida albicans from (10.6%), staphylococcus aureus from (16.1%) which showed the best susceptibility to amikacin and ciprofloxacin (96.5%), proteus mirabilis from (2.8%) which showed the best susceptibility (100%) to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ofloxacin, anaerobic bacteria from (2.2%); and no bacteria growth was observed in (7.2%). There was a significant variation relating signs, symptoms and sex in favor of males (P=0.03). Significant seasonal variation in otitis externa infection was observed (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogenic microorganism, which showed the best susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Pain was the most common symptom.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials in urinary isolates.
AB  - Escherichia coli accounted for about 80% of organisms in uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), followed by Staphylococcus spp. especially Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Proteus mirabilis. Against E. coli isolates from patients with uncomplicated UTI, faropenem was the most effective. Up to 1999, fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were not observed in patients with uncomplicated UTI, but in 2001 fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates emerged and accounted for about 8%. Various types of organisms were isolated in patients with complicated UTI. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the three most frequent organisms isolated. These three organisms accounted for 44.6%. Amongst oral agents, faropenem showed the lowest rate of resistance against E. coli followed by cephems. The rates of highly fluoroquinolone-resistant and cefpodoxime-resistant E. coli isolates increased rapidly from 1998 to 2001. Fluoroquinolone-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates accounted for about 40% in 2001. Against this species, amikacin was the most effective antimicrobials among all agents tested. About 17% of Pseudomonas were resistant to carbapenem. Eight milligram per litre of ampicillin inhibited all E. faecalis isolates; about 60% of Enterococcus faecium were resistant to ampicillin. The rates of levofloxacin-resistant isolates of E. faecalis and E. faecium were 38 and 97% respectively. UTIs caused by vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) are rare in Japan.
TI  - Poly(vinyl chloride)-coated sol-gels for studying the effects of nitric oxide release on bacterial adhesion.
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) releasing sol-gel materials coated with poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) films exhibit increased stability at ambient and physiological temperatures. The polymer overcoat, however, reduces the NO fluxes by 5-35% over the initial week of release. The variation in NO fluxes between unmodified and PVC-coated sol-gels is negligible after 7 days. The PVC polymeric layer provides controlled surface chemistry for systematic studies of the effects of NO release on bacterial adhesion. As an example, the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis at PVC-coated NO-releasing sol-gels is investigated. A direct NO dependence on the reduction of P. aeruginosa adhesion is observed for NO fluxes up to 20 pmol cm(-2) s(-1). Although decreased by 50% in the presence of NO release, P. mirabilis adhesion does not appear to correlate to the flux of NO release. PVC-coated NO-releasing sol-gels may prove useful for studying the effects of localized NO release on other biological and chemical systems.
TI  - PER-1 production in a urinary isolate of Providencia rettgeri.
AB  - A Providencia rettgeri strain resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and intermediate to aztreonam was isolated from the urine of a patient hospitalized in the urology clinic of SSK Educational Hospital in Ankara. Clavulanic acid restored the activity of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, suggesting that the strain was harboring an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Since the PER-1 enzyme is widespread in Turkey, and had been already detected in a related species such as Proteus mirabilis, the Providencia strain was suspected of harboring a PER-1 enzyme, which was indeed detected by PCR. This is the first description in a P. rettgeri isolate of a PER-1 enzyme which is widespread among Acinetobacter baumanni and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in Turkey.
TI  - [Bacterial infections in chronic otitis media--usefulness of molecular diagnostics based on PCR method].
AB  - Infections in chronic otitis media (COM) are common, and identification of their  pathogen is difficult, what is proven by high rate of negative results of bacteriological examinations. This fact may be explained by two factors: it is difficult to obtain a reliable material for culture and classic methods of bacteriological cultures may be of low sensitivity. Amplification of bacterial DNA in PCR is an examination, that leads to a higher effectiveness and sensitivity of bacteriological tests. The authors present material of 53 patients with COM, previously untreated, in which bacteriological examinations by classic and molecular PCR method were performed. The results of both methods were compared. In classic method the presence of pathogens was observed in 46 of 53 cases (86.8%). The most often isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (52.8% of the cases), Staphylococcus aureus (15.1%), Peptostreptococcus sp. and Fusobacterium sp. (11.3% of the cases each) and Proteus mirabilis (7.5%). In 7 cases (13.2%) bacteriological results were negative. Using molecular diagnostic of PCR, the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in 42 cases (79.2%). Isolated strains of P. aeruginosa were epidemiologically unrelated (93.7% of isolates), what was proven in PCR-finger-printing technique. The authors stated that predominant aerobes pathogens in COM are P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and the PCR technique for identification of bacterial DNA presence is very sensitive and allows to precipitate diagnostics of patients with COM. Combination of classical bacteriological tests with PCR technique may be very helpful in estimation bacteriological condition of patients with COM.
TI  - Frequency and diversity of Class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in hospitals of the Auvergne, France: a 2 year prospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) produced by Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one French region. METHODS: During 2001-2002, all the non-duplicate isolates of P. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime and of Enterobacteriaceae intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime and/or aminoglycosides with an AAC(6') I phenotype were collected in nine hospitals of the area. ESBL isoelectric points were determined, bla genes were amplified and sequenced and epidemic isolates were genotyped with ERIC2-PCR. RESULTS: ESBLs were observed in 297 Enterobacteriaceae (0.8%). The most frequent were TEM-3 like (n=152; 51.2%) and TEM-24 (n=115; 38.7%). Four new enzymes were observed, TEM-112 (pI 5.4), TEM-113 (pI 6.3), TEM-114 (pI 5.9) and TEM-126 (pI 5.4). Other TEMs were TEM-8, TEM-12, TEM-16, TEM-19, TEM-20, TEM-21, TEM-29 and TEM-71. The other ESBLs were SHV-4, SHV-5 and SHV-12, CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15. In 37 P. aeruginosa (0.7%) only one ESBL was observed, PER-1. Five epidemic strains were detected, Serratia marcescens TEM-3 and four observed in several hospitals, Enterobacter aerogenes TEM-24, Citrobacter koseri TEM-3, Proteus mirabilis TEM-3 and P. aeruginosa PER-1. CONCLUSION: ESBL frequency was lower than in 1998, and CTX-M-type frequency higher (2.1% of ESBLs in 2001, 4.9% in 2002). This long-term survey detected new sporadic enzymes (TEM-112, TEM-113, TEM-114 and TEM-126) and interhospital epidemic strains while avoiding any overestimation of ESBL frequency that may otherwise have occurred because of acute epidemics.
TI  - Resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  - This study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI). During a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. Fever higher than 38.5 degrees C was significantly more common in the bacteremic group than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. E. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic UTI than non-bacteremic UTI (73% vs 49%; p<0.01). Bacteria other than E. coli (i.e., K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Serratia marcescens, and Providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic UTI than bacteremic UTI (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). E. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). Isolates of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. The emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic UTI in Taiwan. Further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial resistance on the outcome in these conditions.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis and antibacterial activity of cobalt(II), copper(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) complexes of kefzol.
AB  - Kefzol (kzl), a beta-lactam antibiotic, possesses various donor sites for interaction with transition metal(II) ions [Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II)] to form complexes of the type [M(kzl)2]Cl2 and [M(kzl)Cl], with molar ratio of metal: ligand (M:L) of 1:2 and 1:1 respectively. These complexes were prepared and characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Their IR and NMR spectra suggest that kefzol potentially acts as a bidentate, tridentate as well as monoanionic tetradentate ligand. The complexes have been screened for antibacterial activity and results were compared with the activity of the uncomplexed antibiotic against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. The metal complexes were found to be more potent against one or more bacterial species than the uncomplexed kefzol.
TI  - Prosthesis culture 6 months after implantation and the effect of haematogenous seeding in a rat model.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of haematogenous seeding in late prosthesis infection. In all, 45 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups. A small piece of silicone prosthesis was implanted into the scrotum of all rats under sterile condition and antibiotic prophylaxis. In the first group, all silicones were removed after 6 months without any complication and were cultured for bacterial growth. In the second group, a disc, which was saturated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, was inoculated subcutaneously in the legs of the rats in the 6th month, revealing a nodule formation 4-5 days after the inoculation and treated with an appropriate antibiotic after the nodule formation. In the third group, the same disc was inoculated, but all rats were treated immediately from the inoculation time onwards. The silicones of the second and third group were also removed at the end of the 6th month and were cultured to observe the bacterial growth. There was no evidence of prosthesis infection in any of the three groups. In the first group, three cultures were positive and revealed approximately 10 000 colonies of S. epidermidis in two and Proteus mirabilis in the remaining. Three and four cultures were positive in the second and third group, respectively. Low colonies of four different organisms (Escherichia coli, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were identified in these cultures. There was no statistical significance of positive cultures in the three groups. Based on our results, there does not appear to be a true significance of haematogenous seeding on late prosthesis infection.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of essential oils on microorganisms isolated from urinary tract infection].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of essential oils extracted from medicinal plants (Ocimum gratissimum, L., Cybopogum citratus (DC) Stapf., and Salvia officinalis, L.) was assessed on bacterial strains derived from 100 urine samples. Samples were taken from subjects diagnosed with urinary tract infection living in the community. Microorganisms were plated on Muller Hinton agar. Plant extracts were applied using a Steers replicator and petri dishes were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Salvia officinalis, L. showed enhanced inhibitory activity compared to the other two herbs, with 100% efficiency against Klebsiella and Enterobacter species, 96% against Escherichia coli, 83% against Proteus mirabilis, and 75% against Morganella morganii.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Gram-negative bacilli isolates from inpatients and outpatients at Yaounde Central Hospital, Cameroon.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pathogenic bacteria from inpatients and outpatients at a university teaching hospital in Yaounde, Cameroon. METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 522), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) from inpatients and outpatients at Yaounde Central Hospital between March 1995 and April 1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). RESULTS: Of the 522 isolates recorded, 80.3% were Enterobacteriaceae. A high incidence of resistance to amoxicillin (85%), piperacillin (75%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (71%) was observed. The proportion of antimicrobial-resistant isolates from inpatients was significantly higher than that from outpatients (P < 0.05), except for piperacillin, tobramicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The combinations of antimicrobial and organism showed that the percentage of ceftazidime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter cloacae were 26.8% and 24% respectively. The rate of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from inpatients was not significantly higher than that in isolates from outpatients for all the antimicrobial/organism combinations, except for ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli, which was exclusively found in isolates from inpatients. Among Enterobacteriaceae, high and low level penicillinase (mostly in E. coli (13.6% and 11% respectively) and Klebsiella spp. (9% and 8% respectively) were the most important beta-lactam resistance phenotypes (31.2% and 23.6%, respectively). Wild type (exclusively observed in E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp.) and low level penicillinase were higher in outpatient than inpatient isolates (wild type--17.9% vs 10.8% and low level penicillinase--29.4% vs 20.5%, respectively; P < 0.05). However, extended spectrum beta-lactamase strains (Klebsiella spp. (3.5%), E. coli (2.6%), Citrobacter spp. (0.7%), Enterobacter spp. (0.4%) and P. mirabilis (0.2%)) were exclusively recovered from inpatients. Penicillinase and high level cephalosporinase resistance phenotypes were frequently observed in non-fermenter Gram-negative bacilli (46.6% and 29.1% respectively). However, there were no significant differences in penicillinase and cephalosporinase resistance between inpatient and outpatient isolates. CONCLUSION: As the incidence of antimicrobial resistance is substantially higher in isolates from inpatient than outpatient pathogens, more resources should be allocated within the hospital to encourage good antibiotic practices and good hospital hygiene.
TI  - [Bacterial pathogens, resistance patterns and treatment options in community acquired pediatric urinary tract infection].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens in pediatric UTI show large interregional variability and rates of bacterial resistances are changing due to different antibiotic treatment. We intended to evaluate data from northern Germany. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 100 children (53 female, 47 male, mean age 4.4 +/- 4.2 years) with community acquired UTI, who presented in the emergency department of our medical school from 2000 - 2002, urine cultures were performed. Inclusion criteria were: acute voiding symptoms, significant bacteriuria with growth of at least 10 (5) colony-forming units/ml urine, leukocyturia > 50/ micro l. Exclusion criteria were underlying renal diseases, anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, age < 2 months and recurrent UTI. RESULTS: Patients presented with a mean rectal temperature of 38.6 +/- 1.3 degrees C, mean CRP of 66 +/- 68 mg/dl, mean WBC 13 500 +/- 5 600/ micro l and mean urinary leukocytes of 425 +/- 363/ micro l. In urine cultures E. coli was found in 47 % of the cases, Enterococcus faecalis 23 %, Proteus mirabilis 8 %, Klebsiella oxytoca 4 %, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5 % and others 13 %. In 76 % one and in 24 % two different bacterial species (60 % Enterococcus faecalis) were cultured. Mean resistance rates were in all bacteria (in E. coli): Ampicillin 53 % (69 %), Ampicillin and Sulbactam 51 % (61 %), Cefalosporin 1 (st) generation (Cefaclor) 48 % (24 %), Cefalosporin 2 (nd) generation (Cefuroxim) 40 % (3 %), Cefalosporin 3 (rd) generation (Cefuroxim) 33 % (0 %), Tobramycin 30 % (2 %), Ciprofloxacine 0 %, Cotrimoxazole 40 % (42 %), Nitrofurantoin 12 % (0 %). CONCLUSION: The resistance rates to Ampicillin (+/- Sulbactam) did not increase as compared to previous analyses (1990 - 1995), however, resistance rates to Cotrimoxazole and 1 (st) generation Cefalosporines increased about 20 %. We conclude that the policies for treatment of UTI in children should be re-evaluated every 5 years according to local resistance rates.
TI  - Effect of moxifloxacin on bacterial pathogenicity factors in comparison with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Moxifloxacin is a recent fluoroquinolone with an antibacterial spectrum encompassing both aerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains, as well as anaerobic bacteria. In this study the activity of moxifloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and effects of subinhibitory concentrations on bacterial morphology and adhesion properties were compared with those of amoxicillin, clarithromycin and ceftriaxone. The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens was equal to or better than that of comparators. Subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin significantly affected bacterial morphology of S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, leading to formation of spherical forms and filaments. Moreover, bacterial adhesion to buccal cells and fibroblasts was reduced after treatment with 1/4 and 1/8 X MIC of moxifloxacin. In conclusion, subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin remarkably interfere with some bacterial pathogenic factors, thereby contributing to its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Synthesis of some new 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide derivatives and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - In this study, 14 new compounds having 6-methyl-N2-(alkylidene/cycloalkylidene)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide (3a-g), 3-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-4-thiazolidinone (4a-d) and 4-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]no nan/[4.5]decan-3-one (4e-g) structures were synthesized. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 1H-13C-COSY, mass spectra and elemental analysis. All compounds synthesized were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Only 4d and 4f demonstrated antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 19.5 microg/ml and 39 microg/ml, respectively).
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters (up to 36 h). Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (UBT) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. The mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. The mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. The UBTs, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an Escherichia coli ATCC reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following MICs (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, MHB): E. coli ATCC 25922 (0.008/0.008); E. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); Klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016); Proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); Enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); Staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and S. saprophyticus Ho94 (0.125/0.25). The median UBTs measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains including P. aeruginosa and between 1:8 and 1:>or=1024 for the five Gram-positive strains. The median UBTs for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the Gram-negative strains (incl P. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five Gram-positive strains. The UBTs up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (P<0.05 ) for both E. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all Gram-positive strains. For the UBTs at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the Proteus and Pseudomonas strains. The areas under the UBT-time-curve (AUBT) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (P ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for P. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (Gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually Gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated UTI performed previously [Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents (2004)].
TI  - [Bacterial colonization of chronic wounds. Studies on outpatients in a university dermatology clinic with special consideration of ORSA].
AB  - In this retrospective investigation, we documented the bacterial colonization of  79 patients with chronic wounds, who had been treated between January 2002 and May 2003 in an outpatient wound healing clinic of a university dermatology program. We isolated 106 facultative pathogenic bacterial strains of which 56 were Staphylococcus aureus, 19 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11 Escherichia coli, 4 Proteus mirabilis, 4 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 Serratia marcescens, 2 Streptococcus group G und 8 further species. 68 of these bacterial strains were gram-positive and 46 gram-negative. Moreover we identified one patient with Candida parapsilosis. Therefore, 70.8% of all patients showed Staphylococcus aureus in their chronic wounds. Determination of the specific resistances showed 17 patients to be colonized with oxacillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA) strain; this corresponds to 21.5% of all patients. Consequently, 30.4% of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were ORSA strains. All of the ORSA isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. Sensitivity to tetracycline was documented in 15, to amikacin in 13, to clindamycin in 7, to gentamicin and erythromycin in 6 of the ORSA-positive patients. In the case of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, 10 were sensitive and 3 were intermediate in sensitivity. Beside the obligate resistance to oxacillin, penicillin G, ampicillin, cefuroxime and imipenem, none of the ORSA was sensitive to ofloxacin. The results of our investigations demonstrate the actual spectrum of bacterial colonization in chronic wounds of patients in an university dermatologic wound clinic and underline the growing problem of ORSA.
TI  - The status of antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the Taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (TSAR) program, 2000.
AB  - In a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (Taiwan Surveillance of  Antimicrobial Resistance, TSAR), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers and regional hospitals throughout Taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (TSAR II). This report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) in the TSAR II collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (TSAR I) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. Resistance of the 5 Enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in Taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in E. coli, 68% in P. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in K. pneumonia to 66% in S. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in K. pneumoniae to 70% in P. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. Resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in Taiwan than most Western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant A. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli (12%). Differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in TSAR II; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout Taiwan.
TI  - Different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCg against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher MICs (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against Gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. And difference was observed between the binding abilities of EGCg with viable S. aureus and with E. coli. The bactericidal activity of EGCg for S. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide or dextran. It was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of EGCg. These results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different affinities of EGCg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to EGCg.
TI  - [Catheter-related urinary infections at the Clinical Center in Banja Luka].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are the most common nosocomial infections of the urinary tract, and among the most common nosocomial infections in general. The major problems of these infections include antibiotic resistance and enormous direct and indirect cost of treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study on major causes of infections and antibiotic resistance was conducted at four clinics of the Clinical Center of Banja Luka. An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to nursing staff dealing with urinary catheters in order to get an overview of their clinical performance. RESULTS: The results showed that in 89% of cases (out of 198 patients with developed catheter-associated urinary tract infection) infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria, in 7% by gram-positive bacteria and in 4% by candida. The most common bacteria were: Escherichia coli (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.1%), Proteus mirabilis (13.3%), and Enterobacter (10.5%). Majority of bacteria presented with extremely high resistance (72-100%) to ampicillin, gentamycin and cotrimoxazole, and in some cases a significant resistance to ciproflaxacine, nalidixic acid, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. The questionnaire showed that nursing staff did not follow guidelines for medical care of patients with urinary catheters. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that poor hygienic and epidemiological conditions, as well as irrational use of antibiotics contribute to uncontrolled development of urinary tract infections in catheterized patients.
TI  - Results from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Programme: report of the 2001 data from 15 United States medical centres.
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Programme is an international surveillance network of more than 100 medical centres where meropenem is the primary therapeutic carbapenem. Institutions have been monitored since 1997 (1999 in United States (US)) using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) reference susceptibility methods to monitor in vitro activity of meropenem and selected other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. In 2001, a total of 2874 strains were processed from the 15 US medical centres. Molecular methods were associated with MIC methods as needed for defining epidemic spread of resistant strains. The meropenem MIC(90) values were 0.03 mg/l for Citrobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp.; 0.06 mg/l for Proteus mirabilis and Serratia spp. and 0.12 mg/l for Enterobacter spp. This potency was 8-16-fold greater than that of imipenem and the meropenem spectrum of activity versus the Enterobacteriaceae was the broadest of all tested antimicrobial agents. Only piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC(9), 64 mg/l) and tobramycin (MIC(90), 4 mg/l) were active against more than 90.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the NCCLS susceptible breakpoint, and the carbapenems were the most active compounds against Acinetobacter spp. However, Acinetobacter spp. isolates were resistant to all of the antimicrobial agents tested and the molecular typing results suggested that they were epidemiologically related. Only ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime had significantly reduced activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (87.9-92.6% susceptible. These 2001 US MYSTIC Programme results demonstrated no significant decline in carbapenem activity or susceptibility rates compared with the previously monitored years (1999-2000). Most apparent were the decreasing susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime against staphylococci. Continued surveillance in these institutions appears warranted as sites of high potential emerging resistance risk.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. Changes in CZOP susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter Iwoffii, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas. CZOP preserved its antibacterial activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis (MIC90: 4 micrograms/mL) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against H. influenzae (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli was preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), and imipenem (IPM). The MIC90 of CZOP against K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/mL, respectively. The MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. aerogenes was preferable (MIC90: 1 microgram/mL). The antibacterial activities of CZOP against S. marcescens and S. liquefaciens were relatively potent (MIC90: 0.5 and 0.25 microgram/mL) and comparable to those of CPR, CFPM, and carumonam. CZOP preserved comparable antibacterial activity to CPR against C. freundii and C. koseri (MIC90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/mL). The MIC90 of CZOP against P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and M. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Providencia spp. was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. aeruginosa was the most potent (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) among the test agents and comparable to those CFPM, IPM, and MEPM. CZOP had low activity against P. fluorescens and P. putida (MIC90: 128 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against A. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR and CFPM (MIC90: 32 micrograms/mL) and against A. lwoffii was moderate (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). Most of the test agents including CZOP had low antibacterial activity against B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, and B. fragilis group. The MIC90 of CZOP against Prevotella/Porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/mL. Bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. In non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between CZOP and CFPM, CAZ, CPR, or IPM was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. cloacae possible decreased, but against other Gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - Relationship between fluoroquinolone use and changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones of selected pathogens in 10 United States teaching hospitals, 1991-2000.
AB  - We retrospectively examined the relationship between fluoroquinolone use and the  susceptibilities of 11 bacterial pathogens to fluoroquinolones in 10 US teaching hospitals from 1991 through 2000. Statistical significance was determined by 2-way analysis of variance, with the number of isolates tested each year as a weighting factor. The analysis of baseline-to-end point change in the percentage of susceptibility and the slope of the regression line (trend line) for logit percentage of susceptibility showed that the overall percentage of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones decreased significantly during the study period (P<.05) and that change in percentage of susceptibility was significantly related to change in fluoroquinolone use (P<.05). Particularly notable were the decreases in the susceptibilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli (decreases of 25.1%, 11.9%, and 6.8%, respectively).
TI  - Argentinean collaborative multicenter study on the in vitro comparative activity  of piperacillin-tazobactam against selected bacterial isolates recovered from hospitalized patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam and several antibacterial drugs  commonly used in Argentinean hospitals for the treatment of severe infections was determined against selected but consecutively isolated strains from clinical specimens recovered from hospitalized patients at 17 different hospitals from 9 Argentinean cities from different geographic areas during the period November 2001-March 2002. Out of 418 Enterobacteriaceae included in the Study 84% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. ESBLs putative producers were isolated at an extremely high rate since among those isolates obtained from patients with hospital acquired infections 56% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32% of Proteus mirabilis and 25% Escherichia coli were phenotypically considered as ESBLs producers Notably P.mirabilis is not considered by for screening for ESBL producers. ESBLs producers were 100% susceptible to imipenem and 70% were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam whereas more than 50% were resistant to levofloxacin. The isolates considered as amp C beta lactamase putative producers showed 99% susceptibility to carbapenems while 26.7% were resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam and 38.4% to levofloxacin. Noteworthy only 4% of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates were resistant to amikacin. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (MIC(90): 128 microg/ml; 78% susceptibility) but showed poor activity against Acinetobacter spp (MIC(90):>256 microg/ml; 21.7% susceptibility). Only 41.7% Acinetobacter spp isolates were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam inhibited 100% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates (MIC(90) < 0.25 microg/ml) but only 16.6% of them were ampicillin resistant. The activity of piperacillin-tazobactam against oxacillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase negative staphylococci was excellent (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 100% susceptibility). Out of 150 enterococci 12 isolates (8%) were identified as E.faecium and only three isolates (2%), 2 E.faecium and 1 E.faecalis were vancomycin resistant. All the enterococci isolates were susceptible to linezolid. Piperacillin-tazobactam showed excellent activity (MIC(90) 2 microg/ml; 92% susceptibility). Regarding pneumococci all the isolates showed MICs of 16 microg/ml for piperacillin-tazobactam. Among 34 viridans group streptococci only 67% were penicillin susceptible and 85.2% ceftriaxone susceptible whereas piperacillin-tazobactam was very active (MIC(90) 4 microg/ml).Piperacillin-tazobactam is therefore a very interesting antibacterial drug to be used, preferably in combination (IE: amikacin-vancomycin) for the empiric treatment of severe infections occurring in hospitalized patients in Argentina. Caution must be taken for infections due to ESBL producers considering that the inoculum effect MICs can affect MIC values.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Achillea clavennae L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of Achillea clavennae L. (Asteraceae), rare plant of Europe, have been analysed using GC/MS. Twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The activity was more pronounced against Gram-negative and fungal organisms than against Gram-positive bacteria. A. clavennae oil was found to possess antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.
TI  - Comparison of two test methods for the determination of sufficient antimicrobial  activity of three commonly used alcohol-based hand rubs for hygienic hand disinfection.
AB  - In Europe, the antimicrobial efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs is determined with a quantitative suspension test (prEN 12054) and a test under practical conditions (EN 1500). Another test method has recently been published by the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (DGHM) with four differences to the European system in the in vitro tests: additional qualitative suspension tests with product dilutions to the ineffective range; a selection of the most resistant Gram-negative test strains in the qualitative suspension test, which should be used adjacent to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the quantitative suspension test; a high organic load in the quantitative suspension tests (0.3% albumin and 0.3% sheep erythrocytes); and an aqueous control in the quantitative suspension test. According to DGHM, the in vitro tests should be followed by EN 1500. We have determined the antimicrobial efficacy of three commonly used alcohol-based hand rubs according to both methods. prEN 12054 was carried out without organic load. The qualitative suspension tests (DGHM) were carried out with P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae and Candida albicans. The quantitative suspension test (DGHM) was carried out with product dilutions of 75%, 50% and 25%, and a high organic load using the following test organisms: P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis (one product only), S. aureus, E. hirae and C. albicans. All these suspension tests were carried out in quadruplicate with each product and exposure time. EN 1500 was carried out with 3 mL of each product and an application time of 30 s. All three products achieved the required bactericidal activity of prEN 12054 and the new DGHM method within 30 s, and were equally effective with the reference hand disinfection of EN 1500 within 30 s. In our study, the DGHM test method did not provide additional information for hand rubs which exhibit their bactericidal efficacy with 3 mL within 30 s (EN 1500).
TI  - Susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  - The aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. We created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 January, 1990 through 31 December, 2000). Improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. During the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). The mean annual number of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). The 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: Escherichia coli (1494), Staphylococcus aureus (1240), Klebsiella pneumoniae (779), Enterococcus spp. (631), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (488), Streptococcus pneumoniae (447), Enterobacter spp. (338), Acinetobacter spp. (298), Proteus mirabilis (260) and Candida spp. (254). No significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations) per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was E. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was Candida (1, 0.3). Forty percent of organisms (N=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ED), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (ICUs). Trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ED Enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the ICU isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. The difference in susceptibility between ED and ICU isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (P<0.001). A significant decrease in the susceptibility of E coli to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. In K. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of K. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. Pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. Susceptibility of S. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (P<0.001). Marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. Trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic suppurative otitis media in congolese children.
AB  - AIM: The study intended to identify bacteria active in the chronic suppurative otitis media and to determine their sensitivity to current antibiotics. METHODS: After clinical evaluation, middle-ear secretions were taken for bacteriological examination from 78 children meeting the inclusion criteria. All children with cholesteatoma and those with tumors occluding the ear canal were excluded. RESULTS: The most frequent isolated germs, in descending order frequency, were as follows: Proteus mirabilis (23%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), Citrobacter (20%) and Salmonella (5%). There were no cases of mixed flora. Ofloxacin was susceptible on all isolates. Neomycin, gentamicin and polymyxin B were susceptible on 96%, 83% and 67% of the isolates respectively. All isolates were resistant to amoxycillin. CONCLUSION: Peudomonas, Proteus and Citrobacter are the most common causes of chronic otitis media among children in our community of congolese children. Ofloxacin and neomycin are the most highly effective against most of the isolated germs, and are therefore recommended as the first line local treatment. Amoxycillin and chloramphenicol should be avoided.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. A total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabillis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobactor baumannii, Acinetobactor lwoffii, Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lwoffii throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in antibacterial activities of CZOP against B. cepacia, and H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Temporomandibular joint involvement in malignant external otitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present 6 patients with malignant external otitis (MEO) that resulted in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement and to discuss the incidence, clinical presentation, and treatment modalities. STUDY DESIGN: All patients diagnosed with MEO between 1994 and 2002 were reviewed for cases in which the TMJ was invaded by the infectious process. Only patients in whom TMJ involvement was documented radiographically and in whom the clinical course was well documented were included in this study. RESULTS: MEO was diagnosed in 42 patients over an 8-year period; TMJ involvement was recorded in 6 patients (14%). The medical history revealed controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus in 4 of the 6 patients. All patients reported early ear symptoms, mainly otalgia and otorrhea. Local signs included an ear canal filled with granulation material, edematous overlying skin, and sensitivity to palpation. Cultures taken from the external ear were positive for either Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, or Proteus mirabilis. TMJ symptoms developed between 1 and 5 months after admission and included painful periauricular swelling and trismus. In 3 patients, healing was uneventful; 3 also died of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: TMJ involvement in MEO is associated with a resistant disease process, often with several recurrences. Prolonged administration of antibiotics is the treatment of choice. Surgical debridement of the TMJ is necessary for the positive identification of the pathogenic organism, in cases of abscess formation, or when osteomyelitic bone destruction of the condyle and glenoid fossa develop.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, ZnII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 2-(2-Pyridinyl)- (LI), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (LII), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(LIII), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (LIV), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1H-benzimidazoles (LV) and their complexes with Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and AgNO3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The methyl groups of LIII increase the antimicrobial activity. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some ZnII complexes show an antimicrobial effect against S. aureus and S. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. CuII complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - The effect of low concentrations of ascorbic acid in microbial adherence in vitro.
AB  - In the present study, we examined the in vitro effect of low concentrations of ascorbic acid (lower than normal plasma levels), on the adherence of five microbial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to human buccal epithelial cells (BEC) of healthy volunteers. The study reached the following conclusions: 1) the presence of ascorbic acid significantly reduces the ability of all tested strains (with the exception of Klebsiella pneumoniae) to adhere to BEC; 2) ascorbic acid interacts with the epithelial cells and decreases the adherence of all tested microorganisms. These findings may be of potential clinical significance.
TI  - Microbiological study of external otitis in Rosario City, Argentina.
AB  - Mycological and/or bacteriological studies were performed on 294 samples isolated from the external auditory control (EAC). It was observed that 185 (81.5%) of the mycological analysis were negative while 42 (18.5%) were positive with the following distribution: 22 Candida (9.7%), 15 Aspergillus (6.5%) and five associations of Aspergillus and Candida (2.2%). The bacteriological studies were negative in 52 cases (23.6%) and the frequency of the bacterial agents (75.5%) isolated were as follows: 41 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.6%), 24 Proteus mirabilis (10.9%), 24 Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), and three associations of Ps. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis (1.4%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was the most frequent bacterial species isolated, did not present associations with any fungus.
TI  - Diagnosis, treatment and registration of urinary tract infections in geriatric patients.
AB  - Bacteriuria (> or = 10(5) CFU/ml) is a very common phenomenon in elderly people,  occurring twice as frequently in women than in men. There are symptomatic and asymptomatic types of bacteriuria. Risk factors include: a decrease in the estrogen level in women after the menopause, catheterisation, urinary bladder dysfunction, hypertrophy of the prostate gland, diabetes, neurological illnesses. The diagnosis of bacteriuria is based on quantitative urine culture (positive result--> or = 10(5) CFU/ml bacteriae). The most frequent pathogens are: E. coli, enterococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis. The antimicrobial therapy is not advised for asymptomatic bacteriuria. In the case of symptomatic bacteriuria it is advised to take urine for culture and to perform sensitivity testing as well as blood culture and to start a "blind therapy". In order to use the antimicrobial treatment effectively, the most frequently occurring pathogens should be registered and their sensitivity patterns in the given hospital recognised.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Enhanced microbial biomass assay using mutant luciferase resistant to benzalkonium chloride.
AB  - In a biomass assay based on adenosine 5(')-triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence, extracellular ATP is removed; then intracellular ATP is extracted from the microorganism by an ATP extractant and subsequently reacted with luciferase. To provide a highly sensitive assay, the concentration of benzalkonium chloride (BAC) in the ATP extractant was optimized by using a mutant luciferase resistant to BAC. The use of 0.2% BAC, which was acceptable for the luciferase, simultaneously achieved the maximum extraction of intracellular ATP from microorganisms and the inactivation of the ATP-eliminating enzymes for removal of extracellular ATP. The detection limit (blank+3 SD) for ATP was 1.8x10(-14)M (1.8x10(-18)mol/assay) in the presence of the ATP extractant with coefficients of variation of 0.7 to 6.3%. The reagent system coupled with the ATP-eliminating enzymes allowed for the detection of 93 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 170CFU/ml of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 170CFU/ml of Proteus mirabilis ATCC 29906, 68CFU/ml of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and 7.7CFU/ml of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051. The yeast cell of Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFO 10217 could be detected at 1CFU/ml. With 54 kinds of microorganisms, the average ATP extraction efficiency compared to the trichloroacetic acid extraction method was 81.0% in 24 strains among gram-negative bacteria, 99.4% in 13 strains among gram-positive bacteria, and 97.0% in 17 strains among yeast. The ATP contents of the gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria, and yeasts ranged from 0.40 to 2.70x10(-18)mol/CFU (mean=1.5x10(-18)mol/CFU), from 0.41 to 16.7x10(-18)mol/CFU (mean=5.5x10(-18)mol/CFU), and from 0.714 to 54.6x10(-16)mol/CFU (mean=8.00x10(-16)mol/CFU), respectively.
TI  - The influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome. METHODS: From June 1995 to January 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant ICU-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. Clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. We defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the SPSS package (9.0). RESULTS: Among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. In this last group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. Bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. Eleven percent developed septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%), respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). The microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Candida species (4.5% each). The frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.10-6.21; P = 0.015). The global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. The only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (P = 0.04; OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.12-0.97). Septic shock was related to attributable mortality (P = 0.03; OR = 3.19; 95% CI: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (P = 0.24; OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 0.66-4.78). CONCLUSION: Almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. This fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently isolated and the source of the bacteremia.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. We assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in UK and Ireland. Standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. For quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for MIC tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. Compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. These changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of S. aureus-reflected the massive increase of MRSA, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. Based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of P. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of Enterococcus faecalis. Resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in E. coli from 4 to 10%, Klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in AmpC-inducible Enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in P. mirabilis or P. aeruginosa. MIC tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in Enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the E. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. This situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. Thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that MIC be determined with, e.g., an Etest.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns among urine isolates from patients in a geriatric hospital and from older patients in a general hospital in Jerusalem.
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE: Urinary tract infection is the most common cause of nosocomial infections in patients hospitalized in chronic care facilities. The changing spectrum of microorganisms involved in urinary tract infections and the emerging resistance require continuous monitoring to provide crucial information to guide empirical therapy and encourage prudent use of antibiotics. The aim of this survey was to assess the antimicrobial resistance profile of urine isolates from patients hospitalized in a geriatric hospital and from elderly patients hospitalized in an acute care hospital in order to guide empirical therapy of urinary tract infections. METHODS: The survey was performed in two hospitals in Jerusalem: a university-affiliated geriatric hospital- Herzog -and an acute secondary- and tertiary-care university hospital- Hadassah. We performed a retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance of all positive urine cultures obtained from patients in the geriatric division of Herzog Hospital and from patients aged 65 years and older hospitalized in the Internal Medicine departments in Hadassah Hospital during a 1-year period. RESULTS: The most common bacteria isolated from urine specimens in Herzog Hospital were, in order of frequency, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrated a high rate of antimicrobial resistance of those bacteria in both hospitals. The pattern we observed necessitates recommending ceftazidime as the most appropriate empirical therapy for urinary tract infection in Herzog Hospital. In Hadassah Hospital we recommend cefuroxime for those patients in good general condition and ceftazidime for those who present with clinical sepsis. Antimicrobial resistance patterns should be assessed periodically and recommendations modified accordingly. Infection control guidelines should be implemented in order to try to decrease the rate of antimicrobial resistance. Further research is requested to assess the efficacy of such interventions in long-term care facilities.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The chemical composition of essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae) is reported. Four oils from plants growing in different environmental conditions were characterized by GC and GC-MS methods; the oils seem to indicate a new chemotype in the genus Thymus. Influences of soil and altitude characteristics on the essential oil composition are discussed. The oils showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimuium Ty2, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria from Intensive Care Units and  Urology Services. A nationwide study in The Netherlands 1995-2000.
AB  - A nationwide 6-year surveillance of resistance in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from clinical specimens of patients from ten Intensive Care Units and ten Urology Services was started in 1995. MICs of amoxycillin, amoxycillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, imipenem and gentamicin were determined by broth microdilution. Intensive Care Units had higher resistance levels of amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefaclor and ceftazidime (P<0.005) and lower resistance levels of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole and quinolones (P<0.01) than Urology Services. Changes in MIC distributions in time and development of resistant clusters were observed for nitrofurantoin (E. coli), amoxycillin (E. coli, P. mirabilis), amoxycillin/clavulanate (E. coli) and for quinolones (E. coli). The overall resistance level of ceftazidime and gentamicin was <5%, but this fluctuated with the appearance and disappearance of resistant clones in some Intensive Care Units. Quinolone resistance among P. aeruginosa from Intensive Care Units fluctuated between 7 and 14%.
TI  - [Cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  - As a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. Cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; Activity against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter and Klebsiella species; Low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; Minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. Its spectrum is very large being very active against Gram-negative bacilii: Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Citrobacter, Proteus mirabilis and less active against Bacillus fragillis. Cefepime is also very active against Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes. Some of the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; Enterococcus is resistant. Due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases Cefepime (Maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. Cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment efficacy in surgical patients ].
AB  - Between September and December 2001 in the "Caritas" Surgical Clinic of Bucharest has been conducted a clinical study for the efficiency of Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment in surgical patients. Introduced in therapy in the last decade of the XXth Century, Cefepime (Maxipime) is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin, due to its extended spectrum of activity and its high resistance against beta-lactamases. Cefepime (Maxipime) has a very large spectrum, including the majority of the microorganisms implicated in surgical infections: Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae/speciae, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus fragillis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, Citrobacter and other Gram-negative bacilii, Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes). The clinical study included 30 surgical patients, the selection criteria being the severity of the present infection or the potential risk after major (abdominal) surgery. We introduced Cefepime (Maxipime) as first choice of monotheraphy, except: severe, life threatening nosocomial infections, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; failure of another antibiotheraphy schema, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; suspicion of anaerobe contamination, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with metronidazole. The results of our study support the utilization of Cefepime (Maxipime) as the best choice antibiotic in severe surgical infections, especially in the intensive care and surgical units. Cefepime (Maxipime) can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and imidazoles (metronidazole).
TI  - Susceptibility patterns of orally administered antimicrobials among urinary tract infection pathogens from hospitalized patients in North America: comparison report to Europe and Latin America. Results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2000).
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) remain a worldwide nosocomial infection problem.  Geographic variations in pathogen occurrence and susceptibility profiles require monitoring to provide information to guide new (garenoxacin [BMS284756]) therapeutic options. Two thousand seven hundred-eighty UTI isolates from Europe (n = 783), Latin America (531), and North America (1,466) were tested and compared against 44 agents by reference methods in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. The top seven pathogens accounted for 90% of all isolates and the rank order for all regions was: Escherichia coli (1,316; 47%), Enterococcus spp. (351; 13%), Klebsiella spp. (306; 11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (210; 8%), Proteus mirabilis (145; 5%), Enterobacter spp. (97; 4%), and Citrobacter spp. (78; 3%). The pathogen rank order was similar among regions except for the rarer occurrence of Enterococcus spp. (Rank #6, 4%) in Latin America. E. coli ampicillin resistance was highest in Europe and Latin America (51-55%). Ampicillin (37%), ciprofloxacin or garenoxacin (4%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (23%) resistance remained lowest in North America. Nitrofurantoin susceptibility in E. coli was still at acceptable levels and ranged from 91 to 96% across regions. The regional ciprofloxacin-resistant rank order for P. aeruginosa by region was: Latin America (55%) > Europe (41%) > North America (29%). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were only detected in North America (7%). Garenoxacin possessed a 34 to 44% wider spectrum compared to ciprofloxacin against enterococci UTI isolates. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase rates for E. coli and Klebsiella spp. were 4 and 19%, respectively. These results emphasized the need to assess the often striking differences in pathogen occurrence and resistance rates among the commonly encountered UTI pathogens.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - In vitro synergy studies using aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations against six species of Gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination antimicrobial therapy is often necessary to eradicate infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: To evaluate the potential benefit of aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combination therapy, the activity of aztreonam in combination with ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was assessed using checkerboard testing for four clinical isolates of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Burkholderia cepacia and Pseudomanas aeruginosa. RESULTS: All aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations demonstrated additive activity [fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index >0.5-4] or synergy (FIC index <or=0.5) for all 24 isolates tested. Aztreonam plus ciprofloxacin was the most effective combination, demonstrating synergy against 16.7% of isolates (2 P. mirabilis, 1 E. cloacae, 1 B. cepacia). Aztreonam in combination with moxifloxacin was synergistic against 2 isolates (P. mirabilis, E. cloacae), and in combination with gatifloxacin against 1 isolate (E. cloacae). Aztreonam and levofloxacin demonstrated only additive activity. CONCLUSION: Additive activity was observed for the majority of the aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations tested against six species of gram-negative bacilli. Synergy involving aztreonam and fluoroquinolone combinations was less common than additive activity and was isolate dependent. Although in vivo clinical successes have been documented using aztreonam in combination with other agents, confirmation by laboratory techniques requires further investigation.
TI  - Bacteriology of burns at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi.
AB  - A retrospective study to determine the bacterial profile and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of burn isolates at the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), Blantyre, Malawi was undertaken. While a total of 1825 burn patients were admitted to the hospital over a 6-year period (January 1994 to December 1999) only 317 (17.4%) specimens selected from as many patients were processed. One hundred and seventy (170/53.6%) specimens yielded single while the rest (147/46.4%) had multiple isolates giving a total of 535 bacterial isolates. Of this number, 236 (44.1%) were Gram-negatives and 299 (55.9%), Gram-positives. Among the Gram-negatives, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Coliforms/Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common accounting for 94.1% while in the Gram-positive group, staphylococcal and streptococcal spp. predominated (100%). However, the three most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (37.6%), P. aeruginosa (22.4%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (13.6%). While S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were most susceptible to penicillin (33.3 and 64.4% susceptibility, respectively), gentamycin appeared most effective against P. aeruginosa (53.3%). A general broad-spectrum resistance to panels of antibiotics used in the study was however observed among the bacterial isolates. From these results, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, streptococcal spp., P. mirabilis, Coliforms and K. pneumoniae representing 96.4% of all isolates were the most common in the Burns Unit.
TI  - Effects of mupirocin at subinhibitory concentrations on flagella formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Colonization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at trachea, nares and oropharynx can cause ventilator-acquired pneumonia. To identify beneficial effects of antibiotics on expression of virulence factors related to colonization by such pathogens, we evaluated the effect of mupirocin on flagella formation in P. aeruginosa and on motility and flagella formation in Proteus mirabilis. In P. aeruginosa, subinhibitory concentrations of mupirocin inhibited flagella formation, which was associated with reduced flagellin expression. In P. mirabilis, subinhibitory concentrations of mupirocin dose-dependently suppressed bacterial motility and flagella formation, again with reduced flagellin expression. Our results indicate that subinhibitory concentrations of mupirocin can suppress expression of virulence factors in P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis.
TI  - Treatment of gram-negative folliculitis in patients with acne.
AB  - Gram-negative folliculitis may be the result of long-term antibacterial treatment in acne patients. It is caused by bacterial interference and replacement of the Gram-positive flora of the facial skin and the mucous membranes of the nose and infestation with Gram-negative bacteria. These Gram-negative bacteria include Escherischia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marescens, Klebsiella and Proteus mirabilis. The occurrence of Gram-negative folliculitis should be considered in acne patients in whom oral treatment with tetracyclines has not resulted in a significant improvement of acne lesions after 3-6 months' treatment. The occurrence of Gram-negative folliculitis in acne patients is believed to be generally underestimated, since correct sampling and bacteriology is rarely performed by clinicians. Gram-negative folliculitis in acne and rosacea patients is best treated with isotretinoin (0.5-1 mg/kg daily for 4-5 months).
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of [2-[2-(N, N-disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)-acylamino] thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters.
AB  - [2-[2-(N, N-Disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)acylamino ]thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters (3a-x) were synthesized by the reaction of potassium salts of N, N-disubstituted dithiocarbamoic acids with [2-(2-chloroalkanoyl)amino-thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, UV, IR, (1)H-NMR, and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of all the compounds were investigated by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AT CC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds 3a, d, e, f, h, k, w activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 156 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 312 mg/L, 250 mg/L, respectively), compound 3d had some activity against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 156 mg/L) and C. albicans ATCC 10231(MIC: 156 mg/L). Compounds 3l, 3x also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against the test organism.
TI  - A UK multicentre study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of resistance amongst urinary tract pathogens against antimicrobials used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the UK to provide data to help direct empirical therapy. METHOD: During 1999-2000, a total of 1291 bacterial isolates causing UTI were collected from 8 centres in the UK. Isolates were cultured from patients with (1). community-acquired UTI in those less than 65 years old (397), (2). hospital-acquired UTI other than those admitted with pyelonephritis (394), (3). pyelonephritis (108) and (4). community-acquired UTI in those greater than 65 years old (392). After re-identification, MICs for a range of antimicrobials were determined and interpreted using NCCLS procedures and interpretive guidelines. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen in all categories but the total percentage for each category varied (56.3-77.3%). The next three pathogens of importance were Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis which varied in prevalence slightly from category to category. The activity of amoxycillin against E. coli (51.3% susceptible) was greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production and only partially restored by the addition of clavulanic acid (78.8% susceptible). Cefuroxime was very active against E. coli using parenteral form breakpoints (97.1% susceptible) but less so using oral form breakpoints (68.6% susceptible). Cefuroxime was inactive against Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Nitrofurantoin was very active against isolates of E. coli (96.3% susceptible) and E. faecalis but not against K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall susceptibility to trimethoprim ranged from 58.1% to 84.5% for the most prevalent pathogens. Ciprofloxacin was highly active against the UTI pathogens examined in this study with susceptibilities of between 88.6% and 97.7% for the most prevalent pathogens (E. coli, n=864, 97.7% susceptible) and was the only oral agent tested with activity against Pseudomonas spp. CONCLUSION: These data provide much needed information on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens currently causing UTI in the UK.
TI  - Development of resistant bacteria isolated from dogs with otitis externa or urinary tract infections after exposure to enrofloxacin in vitro.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations for enrofloxacin were determined for 63 bacterial isolates from dogs with otitis externa or urinary tract infections. Development of resistant mutants was determined after exposing the isolates to enrofloxacin in vitro for up to five serial passages. Results indicated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp isolates exposed to enrofloxacin developed resistance rapidly, whereas Klebsiella, Proteus, and Streptococcus spp were less likely to develop resistance. Despite the presence of enrofloxacin pressure, no resistant bacteria developed in the Escherichia coli and staphylococcal isolates. In many isolates, susceptibility patterns changed from susceptible to intermediate.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1H- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1H-benzimidazoles.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-R5-1H-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-R5'-phenyl)-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII nitrate complexes was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis. Antifungal activity was tested against Candida albicans. Benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. The ligands show an antibacterial effect against only S. aureus whereas AgI and HgII complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. On the other hand, FeIII complexes show a considerable activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Urinary tract infection trends in Latin American hospitals: report from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infectious diseases diagnosed in outpatients as well as in hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to report the frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of uropathogens collected in Latin America between 1997 to 2000 through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted using reference broth microdilution methods. In the 4 year period, a total of 1961 urine isolates from hospitalized patients were included. The patients' mean age was 51.3 years and most of the infections occurred among women (65.6%). Esherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen isolated followed by Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Among the E. coli isolates, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and amikacin constitute reasonable therapeutic options for treatment of serious UTI in Latin America (91.0-100.0% susceptible). High resistance rates to fluoroquinolones (17.5-18.9%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (>45.0%) were observed among the E. coli. In contrast, nitrofurantoin displayed susceptibility rate of > 87.0%. Against Klebsiella spp. infections, the only effective therapeutic option would be the carbapenems due to the high number of isolates (>30.0%) producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Even the new fluoroquinolones showed limited activity against Klebsiella spp. (72.1-88.6% susceptible) and the P. aeruginosa isolates showed high resistance rates to most antimicrobial agents tested. The results of this survey endorse the importance of Enterobacteriaceae as cause of UTI in Latin America. Our results also demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated in the Latin American medical centers exhibit high resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae constitute serious problem in this geographic region.
TI  - Necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum is a fulminant, life-threatening condition. This infection is usually polymicrobial and may be idiopathic or secondary to local trauma or surgery. Histologically, it is characterized by obliterative endarteritis and thrombosis of the subcutaneous vessels, fascial necrosis, and leukocytic infiltration. Mortality rates of 25-75% have been reported. Most cases of necrotizing gangrene begin insidiously, with scrotal discomfort and malaise. Later, erythema, increasing pain, and swelling, associated with fever and chills, develop. A biopsy is useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to obtain culture samples. Ultrasound imaging may reveal gas or testicular involvement and may help to distinguish this infection from other causes of scrotal pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum, seen at the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Sections of our Institutions between 1994 and 1999, are described. RESULTS: This series included 11 men (73%) and four women (27%), aged 39-68 years (mean, 51 years). In our series, Clostridium perfingens, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumani, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans were isolated. Hemodynamic stabilization and monitoring were performed in all patients. Intravenous antimicrobial therapy was promptly instituted. In most cases, two or more drugs were used. Concurrent surgical debridement of all necrotic areas was always required. When needed, split-thickness skin grafts were used to cover the penile shaft. Expanded mesh grafts were used to reconstruct the vulva and other denuded beds. The survival rate in this series was 87%. CONCLUSIONS: Necrotizing gangrene of the genitalia and perineum continues to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The usual polymicrobial infection with vascular involvement demands hemodynamic stabilization, systemic antimicrobial therapy, and surgical debridement. In some patients, genital, perineal, and abdominal wall reconstruction is also required.
TI  - Susceptibility of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria to biocides: a perspective from the study of catheter biofilms.
AB  - Bacteria resistant to both the agents deployed to prevent infections and those used to treat infections would be formidable nosocomial pathogens. The aim of this paper is to review the evidence that gram-negative bacteria resistant to antibiotics and biocides have emerged and been responsible for catheter-associated urinary tract infection. A study of patients undergoing intermittent bladder catheterization revealed that the frequent application of the antiseptic chlorhexidine to the perineal skin prior to the insertion of the catheter was effective against the normal gram-positive skin flora but not against the gram-negative organisms that subsequently colonized this site. Organisms such as Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were repeatedly isolated from the skin of these patients and inevitably went on to cause urinary infections. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chlorhexidine for many of these strains proved to be 200-800 microg ml(-1) compared with the 10-50 microg ml(-1) recorded for reference strains of gram-negative species. A subsequent survey of over 800 gram-negative isolates from urinary tract infections in patients from both hospitals and the community revealed that chlorhexidine resistance was not a widespread phenomenon, but was restricted to these species and to units where the care of catheterized patients involved the extensive use of chlorhexidine. Analysis of the antibiotic resistance patterns revealed that the chlorhexidine-resistant strains were also multidrug resistant. Other clinical studies also reported catheter-associated infections with chlorhexidine- and multidrug-resistant strains of Pr. mirabilis when chlorhexidine was being used extensively. This species poses particular problems to the catheterized patient. Chlorhexidine thus proved counterproductive in the care of catheters and its use in this context has been largely abandoned. Suggestions of reintroducing this agent in the form of biocide-impregnated catheters should be resisted.
TI  - Modification of dienes mutual inhibition test for epidemiological characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important cause of community-associated and nosocomial infections related to exposure to aqueous environments. Such infections often occur in the setting of a common-source outbreak, in which case epidemiological characterization of isolates may be necessary. In this preliminary study, a modification of the Dienes mutual inhibition test, ordinarily used to assess the relatedness of swarming Proteus mirabilis strains, was used to study 15 P. aeruginosa isolates, with the results compared to those obtained by ribotype analysis. Complete concordance was noted between the results of the Dienes test and those of ribotyping. These observations suggest that further studies are warranted to assess the utility of the modified Dienes test as a simple, inexpensive, and reliable means for epidemiological typing of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate, a new injectable quinolone].
AB  - We investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of pazufloxacin mesilate (PZFX mesilate), a new injectable quinolone, and obtained the following results. 1) The MIC50 and MIC90 values of PZFX against clinically isolated Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, ranged from 0.0125 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and 0.025 to 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. PZFX showed broad spectrum activity. The antibacterial activities of PZFX against quinolone-susceptible, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase possessing Klebsiella pneumoniae and imipenem/cilastatine (IPM/CS)-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were superior to those of ceftazidime (CAZ), ceftriaxone, IPM/CS, meropenem and panipenem/betamipron. 2) PZFX showed superior bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa to those of CAZ and IPM/CS after treatment for 15 minutes at the drug concentration equivalent to that in human serum at clinical dose to be continued for 15 minutes. 3) CAZ and IPM/CS had no bactericidal activity at the 16 times of MIC against P. aeruginosa in human polymorphonuclear leucocytes, while PZFX exhibited potent bactericidal activity in a dose-dependent manner against such bacteria. 4) PZFX inhibited both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from S. aureus at nearly the same level. PZFX showed poor inhibitory activity against topoisomerase II from human placenta and showed high selectivity to bacterial topoisomerase. 5) PZFX mesilate showed superior therapeutic activity to that of CAZ with following infection model caused by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa or each; systemic infection with cyclophosphamide-treated mice, systemic infection in mice with high challenge doses, CMC pouch infection in rat, and calculus infection in rat bladder. 6) Intravenous administration of PZFX with high plasma concentration just after administration, showed more excellent therapeutic effect against the rat intraperitoneal infection, than p.o. and s.c. administration.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 511 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and Gram-negative bacteria as 71.0%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase in low-susceptible strains of E. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains with 4 micrograms/ml. ABK showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. ABPC, cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) also showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; IPM prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. CZOP and CTM also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/ml; MIC80 and MIC90 of CTM were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (GM) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 32 micrograms/ml. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of IPM and GM were the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of MEPM was 4 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide LL-37.
AB  - Effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. Here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the antibacterial peptide LL-37. Analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by P. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at Asn-Leu and Asp-Phe, followed by two breaks at Arg-Ile, thus inactivating the peptide. Proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded LL-37 as determined by SDS-PAGE. Ex vivo, P. aeruginosa elastase induced LL-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. The degradation was blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitors GM6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited P. aeruginosa elastase, P. mirabilis proteinase, and E. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor E64 (which inhibited S. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). Additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [DeltaUA(2S)-GalNAc(4,6S)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of LL-37. The results indicate that proteolytic degradation of LL-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Pathology of a mouse model of x-linked chronic granulomatous disease.
AB  - A colony of knockout mice (gene designation Cybb tm1) has been maintained at this institution for 5 years. These mice are lacking the b subunit of NADPH oxidase and are susceptible to experimental infection with Aspergillus fumigatus. The purpose of this study was to document the spontaneous diseases present in these mice which are a murine model of X-linked chronic granulomatous disease and to compare these lesions to those of chronic granulomatous disease in humans. Lesions were documented in 72 mice submitted to the necropsy service. All 72 mice had an acidophilic macrophage pneumonia, and 16 also had lobar suppurative and necrotizing pneumonias caused by Paecilomyces sp. (11 of the 16 mice), A. fumigatus (3 mice), Rhizopus sp. (1 mouse), or Candida guilliermondii (1 mouse). Of the 72 animals, 36 had severe bacterial suppurative and necrotizing to pyogranulomatous pneumonias; lung abscesses yielded cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), Enterococcus (n = 6), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), S. xylosus (n = 1), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp. (n = 4), gram-negative enteric bacilli (n = 6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Proteus mirabilis (n = 2). Thirteen mice had a necrotizing and suppurative adenitis of the cervical lymph nodes caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sp.; S. aureus, S. xylosus, and S. equorum were recovered from abscesses in the cervical lymph nodes, extremities, and head. Splenomegaly was found in 30 animals and lymphadenopathy in 11 mice. The array of spontaneously occurring infectious diseases and lesions in these mice is similar to that of human patients with chronic granulomatous disease.
TI  - Characterization of flagella produced by clinical strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
AB  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen associated with opportunistic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis, cancer, and HIV. Adherence of this organism to abiotic surfaces such as medical implants and catheters represents a major risk for hospitalized patients. The adhesive surface factors involved in adherence of these bacteria are largely unknown, and their flagella have not yet been characterized biochemically and antigenically. We purified and characterized the flagella produced by S. maltophilia clinical strains. The flagella filaments are composed of a 38-kDa subunit, SM(FliC), and analysis of its N-terminal amino acid sequence showed considerable sequence identity to the flagellins of Serratia marcescens (78.6%), Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei (71.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.2%). Ultrastructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy of bacteria adhering to plastic showed flagellalike structures within the bacterial clusters, suggesting that flagella are produced as the bacteria spread on the abiotic surface.
TI  - [Experimental study on bacteriostasis of chitosan and sodium hyaluronate].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect and coverage of bacteriostasis of chitosan and sodium hyaluronate. METHODS: Each of the five bacteria, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, was cultivated for 33 tubes of broth culture. Leaving three tubes each group as control group, ploidy diluted concentration of high relative molecular weight chitosan, low relative molecular weight chitosan and sodium hyaluronate were added respectively in the broth culture. All the tubes were cultivated for 18 hours at 37 degrees C with homeothermia. Then the growth of bacteria was observed. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of high relative molecular weight chitosan were: Proteus mirabilis 0.031%, Escherichia coli 0.063%, Candida albicans 0.063%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 0.063%, Staphylococcus aureus 0.063%; and the MIC of low relative molecular weight chitosan were: Proteus mirabilis 0.125%, Escherichia coli 0.025%, Candida albicans 0.25%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 0.25%, Staphylococcus aureus 0.125%; bacteria grew well in each tube of sodium hyaluronate group and control group. CONCLUSION: The above results show that sodium hyaluronate has no bacteriostasis, while chitosan has bacteriostasis on broad spectrum and high relative molecular weigh: chitosan has stronger effect.
TI  - [Effectiveness of imipenem/cilastatin (Tienam, MSD) in treating complicated infections in urology].
AB  - Complicated urinary infections tend to eventuate in severe pyoseptic complications--bacteriuria, sepsis. The search for methods of fighting agents of urinary infections goes in the direction of perfection of already existing methods and in the direction of design of novel antibacterial drugs. In the middle 1980s the first carbapenem drug-imipenem--was proposed for urological clinical practice. Mechanism of its action as that of the other beta-lactam antibiotics consists in impairment of synthesis of bacterial cell wall as a result of the drug penetration through the surface membrane and irreversible binding with penicillin-binding proteins. Imipenem is active against most gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms which cause severe urological infections. The article presents the results of treatment of 45 patients with severe urological infections with multiple resistance of the causing agent and failure of previous treatment. Imipenem was given in a daily dose 1.5-2.0 g. Sometimes a stepwise regimen was used: 500 mg 4 times a day intravenously for the first 3-4 days, then 500 mg twice a day intramuscularly for the following 3-4 days. In detection of highly sensitive bacteria (E. coli, Proteus mirabilis) daily doses were reduced to 1 g. In long standing infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa imipenem was combined with amicacin. In high surgical risk of postoperative period imipenem was given prior to surgery and continued after it for 5 to 14 days. Good therapeutic results were achieved: clinical effect reached 95.5%, antibacterial efficiency was 87.8%. Thus, imipenem is antibiotic of the first line in empirical therapy of severe bacterial infections in urology as it has a wide spectrum of antibacterial action. We believe that this drug should not be left as a reserve but used for a starting empirical therapy of severe infections in urological hospital.
TI  - Evaluation of a new Etest for detecting metallo-beta-lactamases in routine clinical testing.
AB  - Several Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) gradient formats were developed for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases based on the reduction of imipenem (IP) or ceftazidime (TZ) MICs in the presence of EDTA or 2-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). The Etest metallo-beta-lactamase (Etest MBL) strips consisted of a double-sided seven-dilution range of IP or TZ (4 to 256 microg/ml) and IP or TZ (1 to 64 microg/ml) overlaid with a constant concentration of EDTA or MPA. The prototype strips were evaluated on several agar media (brain heart infusion agar, Isosensitest agar, nutrient agar, and Mueller-Hinton agar for aerobes and brucella blood agar for anaerobes) with 138 challenge strains: Acinetobacter spp. (n = 9), Aeromonas spp. (n = 8), Chryseobacterium spp. (n = 28), Escherichia coli (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), Proteus mirabilis (n = 3), Serratia spp. (n = 10), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 43), Sphingobacterium spp. (n = 3), and Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 15). PCR analysis using specific primers for IMP-1, L1, CcrA, and bla(B/C) confirmed the presence of the metallo-beta-lactamase genes. Enzyme assays were also performed with IP as an indicator substrate followed by EDTA inhibition profiles. EDTA was found to be a better inhibitor of metallo-beta-lactamases, especially for anaerobes. IP was a better than TZ. Mueller-Hinton agar was the preferred medium, particularly when compared to Isosensitest agar, which frequently produced falsely low MICs for IP. Etest IP plus IP-EDTA with Mueller-Hinton agar had a sensitivity of 94% (79 of 84) and specificity of 95% (124 of 130). The Etest MBL strip appears to be an acceptable diagnostic reagent to detect metallo-beta-lactamase phenotypes in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Resistant pathogens in urinary tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing urinary tract infection (UTI) has evolved over several decades as antimicrobial exposure has repeatedly been followed by emergence of resistance. Older populations in the community, long-term care facilities, or acute care facilities have an increased prevalence of resistant bacteria isolated from UTI. Resistant isolates are more frequent in long-term care populations than the community. Resistant isolates include common uropathogens, such as Escherichia coli or Proteus mirabilis, and organisms with higher levels of intrinsic resistance, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Providencia stuartii. Isolation of resistant organisms is consistently associated with prior antimicrobial exposure and higher functional impairment. The increased likelihood of resistant bacteria makes it essential that a urine specimen for culture and susceptibility testing be obtained before instituting antimicrobial therapy. Therapy for the individual patient must be balanced with the possibility that antimicrobial use will promote further resistance. Antimicrobial therapy should be avoided unless there is a clear clinical indication. In particular, asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antimicrobials. Where symptoms are mild or equivocal, urine culture results should be obtained before initiating therapy. This permits selection of specific therapy for the infecting organism and avoids empiric, usually broad-spectrum, therapy. Where empirical therapy is necessary, prior infecting organisms should be isolated, and recent antimicrobial therapy, as well as regional or facility susceptibility patterns, should be considered in antimicrobial choice. Where empirical therapy is used, it should be reassessed 48 to 72 hours after initiation, once pretherapy cultures are available.
TI  - Emerging fluoroquinolone-resistance for common clinically important gram-negative bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the three most commonly used fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) was measured for 2235 isolates of seven common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. Collected from a major teaching hospital in Taiwan during the years 1985-86, 1989-90, and 1996-97, the samples were evaluated using the agar dilution method. The overall susceptibility to fluoroquinolones has decreased rapidly after the wide use of these antimicrobial agents. Isolates of Escherichia coli and Morganella morganii proved quite susceptible to the fluoroquinolones until 1996. By 1996-97, 20% of the bacteria had become resistant to the fluoroquinolones. Activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis remained excellent, however, with more than 90% of the isolates susceptible during the survey period. Interestingly, some strains of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrating in vitro resistance even before the fluoroquinolones were launched in Taiwan. This resistance increased rapidly, with around 20-30% of S. marcescens isolates fluoroquinolone-resistant by 1996-1997. After the introduction of the fluoroquinolones, resistance was demonstrated for about 15% of the P. aeruginosa isolates, and 20% of Enterobacter cloacae isolates, with the susceptibility rate remaining steady state through the 1990s. Different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns have been demonstrated for most fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, suggesting that the increased resistance was not due to the spread of a single clone. We conclude a trend of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance for many common gram-negative bacteria in Taiwan, especially in recent years. Appropriate use of the new fluoroquinolones should be encouraged in order to prevent the rapid emergence and increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, and carbapenems. Thirty-two species 2,697 strains of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 125), Escherichia coli (n = 250), Citrobacter freundii (n = 153), Citrobacter koseri (n = 97), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 150), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 100), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 50), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 125), Serratia marcescens (n = 153), Proteus mirabillis (n = 103), Proteus vulgaris (n = 77), Morganella morganii (n = 141), Providencia spp. (P. alcalifaciens, P. rettgeri, P. stuartii; n = 154), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 211), Pseudomonas putida (n = 49), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 102), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 101), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 210), Acinetobactor baumannii (n = 63), Acinetobactor Iwoffii (n = 30), Bacteroides fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 129), and Prevotella spp. (P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. oralis, P. denticola; n = 124). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, C. freundii, C. koseri, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, Providencia spp., P. aeruginosa, and A. lowffii throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. On the other hand, the MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 65-time difference during study period. The MIC90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against H. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. The present results demonstrated that CZOP had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost Gram-negative strains tested. However, the decrease in the antibacterial activity of CZOP against H. influenzae was suggested.
TI  - Susceptibility of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria to biocides: a perspective from the study of catheter biofilms.
AB  - Bacteria resistant to both the agents deployed to prevent infections and those used to treat infections would be formidable nosocomial pathogens. The aim of this paper is to review the evidence that Gram-negative bacteria resistant to antibiotics and biocides have emerged and been responsible for catheter-associated urinary tract infection.

Suggestions of reintroducing this agent in the form of biocide-impregnated catheters should be resisted.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--II. Gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Changes in CZOP susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with the breakpoint MIC. Twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), Escherichia coli (n = 276), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 93), Serratia marcescens (n = 172), Serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), Citrobacter freundii (n = 177), Citrobacter koseri (n = 70), Proteus mirabilis (n = 113), Proteus vulgaris (n = 89), Morganella morganii (n = 116), Providencia spp. (n = 41), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), Pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), Pseudomonas putida (n = 63), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), Acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), Burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and Prevotella/Porphyromonas (n = 173). An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and S. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against M.(B.) catarrhalis, C. koseri, and P. aeruginosa was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. MIC90 of CZOP against E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, and P. mirabilis increased year by year. The increase in MIC90 of CZOP against E. aerogenes and P. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. In contract, the susceptibility of E. cloacae to CZOP was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to CZOP. MIC90 of CZOP against C. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. Additionally, MIC90 of CZOP against H. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. cepacia, S. maltophilia, B. fragilis group, and Prevotella/Porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. Changes in MIC90 of CZOP against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.
TI  - Diterpenoids from Salvia ceratophylla.
AB  - Salvia ceratophylla L. has yielded four known and two new diterpenoids together with two triterpenic acids, a steroid and a flavone. The structures of the compounds were established by spectroscopic analyses. One of the known compounds candidissiol exhibited a high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Histopathologic and bacteriologic evaluations of cellulitis detected in legs and  caudal abdominal regions of turkeys.
AB  - The objective of this study was to identify the causative agent of cellulitis in  turkeys. Eighteen flocks from nine producers were sampled at the local processing plant, and 37 birds with cellulitis on legs or caudal thoracic area were obtained. None of the 37 birds with cellulitis had lesions in other organs. On gross examination, lesions were categorized into two groups: cellulitis with unopened skin lesions (type a) and cellulitis with opened skin lesions (type b). Histopathologically, cellulitis with unopened skin lesions had dermal necrosis with underlying fibrin and inflammatory exudate but cellulitis with open skin lesions had chronic granulomatous/granulation tissue-type reaction associated with foreign material. A complete bacteriologic study was conducted on 25 of 37 birds. Bacteria were isolated from 12 of the 25 birds with cellulitis lesions. No aerobic, microaerophilic, or anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the remaining 13 birds with cellulitis lesions. Escherichia coli was isolated in low numbers in mixed cultures with Proteus mirabilis, Lactobacillus spp., Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in 9 of 12 lesions. The remaining few cases yielded P. mirabilis in pure culture or in mixed culture with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Types a and b cellulitis lesions in turkeys could be associated with primary contact dermatitis and skin abrasions, respectively. Their occurrence is likely associated with different management practices.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative isolates from European intensive care units: data from the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) programme.
AB  - Susceptibility data were collected for 6243 gram-negative isolates from 29 European ICUs participating in the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Programme (1997-2000). The most commonly isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%), Escherichia coli (19.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.4%), and Enterobacter cloacae (7.7%). The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers was higher in Turkish, Russian and Italian ICUs (27.9-39.6%) than in other countries (2.5-10.8%). The frequency of AmpC-cephalosporin hyper-producers was 16.8-55.4%. Meropenem was more active against Proteus mirabilis than imipenem (99.0% versus 88.8% susceptibility, respectively). Against Acinetobacter baumannii, meropenem (79.6% susceptible) and imipenem (82.2%) were more active than comparators (34.3-51.6%). Meropenem and imipenem exhibited good activity against P. aeruginosa (76.1% and 68.2%, respectively; but with inter-country variation). Ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli and K. pneumoniae increased and needs close monitoring. Meropenem (98.2-99.8% susceptibility) and imipenem (88.8-99.4%) remained potent against important species of gram-negative bacteria from European ICUs actively using meropenem.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - The characterization of bacterial isolates from acute otitis media in Ile-Ife, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in a comprehensive healthcare setting was investigated in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Out of the 617 children examined, 53 (11.64 per cent) suffered from the condition based on the criteria used. Staphylococci constituted the predominant organisms associated with the condition with Staphylococcus aureus (25.0 per cent) being the most frequent single microbe recovered from the subjects. This was followed by Proteus mirabilis (16.2 per cent), Staphylococcus sp. (8.8 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.8 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae (7.4 per cent each). Most isolates tested were multiply resistant to the antibiotics commonly employed in treating infections caused by these organisms. The study highlights the prevalence of multi-resistant organisms amongst the subjects and recommends prompt therapeutic intervention to avert ineffectiveness of antibiotics when used in treating infections caused by these organisms in the community.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in plasma and urine.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bactericidal activity of gatifloxacin in serum and  urine against relevant pathogens. METHODS: Serum and urine samples obtained in a single rising dose pharmacokinetic study were investigated for bactericidal activity. The doses employed were placebo, and 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg of gatifloxacin. RESULTS: The titers obtained reflected the dose and susceptibility of the pathogen. In serum a titer of greater-than-or-equal1:8 was observed for Escherichia coli for >24 h after 400 mg; for Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumanii the titer was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for between 12--24 h after 600 mg; for Serratia marcescens it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for >12 h following 800 mg; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae it was greater-than-or-equal1:8 for 8 h following 800 mg. In urine, the titers were greater, and for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis the titer was >1:8 for 12--24 h after 200 mg and for 24--36 h after a 400-mg dose. Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated a titer of >1:8 for 18--24 h following 600 mg. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that gatifloxacin should be efficacious for a wide range of systemic and urinary tract infections.
TI  - The migration of Proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over Foley catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of Foley catheters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. The sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms on the agar on the other side of the bridges. A collection of swarming, swimming and nonmotile species were tested in the model. The relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. RESULTS: The swarmer cells of Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris migrated successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. The migration index of Serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. Indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. The mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). The swarmer cells of P. mirabilis moved through populations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. They were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of K. pneumoniae and S. aureus over the catheters. The migration index of P. mirabilis swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of Ps. aeruginosa and S. marcescens. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. With the exception of S. marcescens, the incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. Swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and P. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. This suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.
TI  - [In vitro antimicrobial activity of glutaraldehyde plus O-phenylphenol association (ratio 2:1)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The correct use of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterilization processes to inactivate or remove micro-organisms is an essential component of an effective infection control program. To reach this result the use of phenolic detergent-disinfectants which work well as a presoak has always been suggested in lieu of sterilization involving submerging instruments in a properly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for about 6 to 10 hrs. This study investigated the in vitro effectiveness of disinfectant solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% o-phenylphenol. METHODS: The organisms used were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228), and from our clinical collection (Proteus mirabilis CH 14, Klebsiella oxytoca CH 22, Serratia liquefaciens CH 90). MIC and MBC were evaluated as testing solution for antimicrobial activity. The contact time studied between disinfectant and bacteria were 30 sec, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. RESULTS: The results showed that MIC values for most bacteria were 3.75 mg/ml. The MBC values were similar or higher than the MIC. The disinfectant solution killed E. coli and C. albicans already after 10 min, but for S. aureus 30 min was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that this solution attained the sterilization of surgical instruments in good timing and at low cost.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - In this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. Structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (UV, IR, 1H NMR, El MS) and elemental analyses. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. Compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC, 156 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some 1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid derivatives.
AB  - Ethyl 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetate (2), 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazide (3) and a series of new N-alkylidene/arylidene-5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazides (4a-f) were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. Compound 4f showed antibacterial activity against some bacteria. The in vitro antimycobacterial activity of the new compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was evaluated employing the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The highest inhibition observed was 61% at > 6.25 microg/ml.
TI  - Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among commonly isolated Gram-negative bacilli  in 2000: TRUST and TSN data for the United States. Tracking Resistance in the United States Today. The Surveillance Network.
AB  - From January to May 2000, as part of the Tracking Resistance in the United States Today (TRUST) surveillance initiative, clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae (n=2519) and non-fermentative Gram-negatives (n=580) were prospectively collected from 26 hospital laboratories across the United States. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to three fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) and seven other agents. In addition, data for the same period were collected from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA, an electronic surveillance network that receives data from more than 200 laboratories in the US. Both surveillance methods produced similar results. Against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, imipenem was the most active agent, followed by the fluoroquinolones; > or = 86.7% of isolates of all species of Enterobacteriaceae except Providencia spp. were susceptible to fluoroquinolones by TRUST and TSN surveillance. TRUST identified differences in susceptibility to the three fluoroquinolones of > or = 2% for Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens. Isolates of P. mirabilis were considerably more susceptible to levofloxacin (94.0%) than to ciprofloxacin (87.7%) and gatifloxacin (87.7%). Other results from TRUST included Pseudomonas aeruginosa being slightly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (73.5%) and levofloxacin (73.0%) than gatifloxacin (71.0%). Imipenem was the only compound with significant activity (95.1% susceptible, TRUST; 87.4% susceptible, TSN) against Acinetobacter baumannii, but it was inactive against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. S. maltophilia isolates were more susceptible to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin (77.7-79.8%) than ciprofloxacin (29.7-33.0%). Against 513 urinary isolates of Escherichia coli in TRUST, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equipotent. Age and gender had no clear effect on the activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin. Similar results for all three fluoroquinolones were seen in outpatients and inpatients. TRUST and TSN data indicated that resistance rates had not changed appreciably for any compound studied since a similar study conducted in 1999. TRUST centralized in vitro and electronic (TSN) surveillance methods provided an effective strategy for monitoring trends in resistance.
TI  - Sudden increase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial strains with broad host range transfer of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - We investigated transfer of antibiotic resistance from 51 multiply resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from seriously ill patients in the Frankfurt University Clinics. Nine isolates directly transferred resistance to three recipient strains used. Ticarcillin and cephalothin resistance determinants were accepted from eight isolates, and in one case a kanamycin resistance determinant was transferred. The total spectrum of resistance transferred demonstrated that several donor strains transferred a different set of resistance determinants to all three recipient strains. Two P. aeruginosa isolates transferred spectrum of seven resistance determinants including ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam, three isolates transferred five determinants and four isolates transferred four resistance determinants. The fact that identical spectra of multiple drug resistance were transferred to recipient strains belonging to three different species (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa), indicates a broad host range in all three transferable genetic elements not observed in previous transfers from P. aeruginosa strains.
TI  - MYSTIC program: summary of European data from 1997 to 2000.
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program  is a global study providing in-vitro surveillance data on microbial susceptibility in centers that prescribe meropenem. This paper summarizes data on the activity of meropenem and five comparator agents against 13,793 clinical isolates from 31 centers in 10 European countries, 1997-2000. Meropenem and imipenem demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against the tested organisms, including beta-lactamase-producing strains that were co-resistant to quinolones and aminoglycosides. The carbapenems were active against the most frequently isolated pathogens including staphylococci (98-100% susceptible), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (65-82% susceptible) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (98-100% susceptible). Resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins was observed, particularly among Enterobacter species in Southern and Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe showed a high prevalence of AmpC beta-lactamase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains in Russia (2000); 47% and 28% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates were AmpC or ESBL-producers, respectively. There was no significant decrease in susceptibility to the carbapenems throughout the four-year period. Meropenem and imipenem appear to remain reliable options for the treatment of serious nosocomial infections.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin after a single oral dose in healthy volunteers.
AB  - In a randomized crossover study, 16 volunteers (8 men, 8 women) received single oral doses of 320 mg of gemifloxacin and 400 mg of ofloxacin on two separate occasions in the fasting state to assess the urinary excretion and urinary bactericidal titers (UBTs) at intervals for up to 144 h. Ofloxacin showed higher concentrations in urine compared with those of gemifloxacin. The median (range) cumulative excretion of gemifloxacin was 29.7% (8.4 to 48.7%) of the parent drug administered, and median (range) cumulative excretion of ofloxacin was 84.3% (46.5 to 95.2%) of the parent drug administered. The UBTs, i.e., the highest twofold dilutions (with antibiotic-free urine as the diluent) of urine that were still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and nine uropathogens for which the MICs of gemifloxacin and ofloxacin were as follows: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, 0.016 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively; Proteus mirabilis, 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml, respectively; Escherichia coli, 0.06 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.008 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.06 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.5 and 32 microg/ml, respectively; and Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 32 microg/ml, respectively. Generally, the UBTs for gram-positive uropathogens were higher for gemifloxacin than for ofloxacin and the UBTs for gram-negative uropathogens were higher for ofloxacin than for gemifloxacin. According to the UBTs, ofloxacin-resistant uropathogens (MICs, >or=4 mg/liter) should also be considered gemifloxacin resistant. Although clinical trials have shown that gemifloxacin is effective for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, whether an oral dosage of 320 mg of gemifloxacin once daily is also adequate for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections has yet to be confirmed.
TI  - Gram-negative bacterial toe web infection: a survey of 123 cases from the district of Cagliari, Italy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foot intertrigo is mostly caused by dermatophytes and yeasts, less frequently by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Nevertheless, the importance of polymicrobial infections and especially colonizations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause therapy problems in relation to antibiotic resistance and the risk of potentially lethal complications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the main epidemiologic and clinical features of intertrigo from gram-negative bacteria, the function of promoting factors, and the measures taken to treat and prevent this disorder. METHODS: Between 1989 and 1998, 123 cases of intertrigo from gram-negative bacteria were observed at the Cagliari University Dermatology Department. Routine clinical and blood examinations, repeated bacterioscopic and mycologic examinations, cultures aimed at identifying the responsible bacteria, and antibiograms were performed. RESULTS: P aeruginosa was found to be the prevailing pathogen, both alone and associated with other gram-negative bacteria (such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii) and gram-positive bacteria. Clinical manifestations were similar in the majority of patients: erythema, vesicopustules, erosions, and marked maceration caused by abundant, malodorous exudate. Lesions affected the interdigital spaces of both feet and frequently extended to the planta and the back of the toes. Patients complained of burning and pain. Successful therapies were achieved with combined topical and systemic treatment; to avoid the risk of antimicrobial resistance, the choice of the active antibiotic was guided by antibiograms. CONCLUSION: In all symptomatic toe web infections, the presence of gram-negative germs, such as P aeruginosa, should be investigated to avoid the risk of treatment failures and more severe local or systemic complications.
TI  - [Experimental study of photodynamic effect on bacterial wound microflora].
AB  - The in vitro study of the influence of photodynamic action (with the use of photosensitizer "Photosens", laser and non-laser irradiation) on the strains of the main representatives purulent wound microflora was carried out. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis cultures have been isolated from wound secretions and identified. The photosensitizer was shown to produce no bactericidal effect by itself. Irradiation with laser and non-laser light sources induced a sharp decrease in the number of viable cells in the cultures under study. The irradiation of the photosensitizer led to its activation, manifested in bactericidal action. The results thus obtained confirm good prospect of using photodynamic therapy for the treatment of purulent wounds.
TI  - Bacteriology of diabetic foot.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the relative frequency of bacterial isolates cultured from diabetic foot infections and assess their comparative in vitro susceptibility to the commonly used antibacterial agents. METHODS: This is a retrospective study with a review of the bacteriology results of specimens taken from 111 consecutive patients with diabetic foot infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the period January 1997 to June 1999. The specimens were cultured using optimal aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing to different agents, was carried out using the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate being recovered from 28% of cases, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in 9 of 30 (30%) patient wounds. The other organisms isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%) and Proteus mirabilis (18%), anaerobic gram-negative organisms (11%) mainly Bacteroides fragilis. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing, showed that vancomycin was the most effective against gram-positive and and imipenem was the most effective against gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Bacteroides fragilis were the most common causes of diabetic foot infections. These wounds require use of combined antimicrobial therapy for initial patient management prior to susceptibility results.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1999). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 1999 to July 2000. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 499 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 31.3% and Gram-negative bacteria as 68.7%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. The increase of low-susceptible strains which was noticed in the former year showed a slight recovery in this year. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was also strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA. However, MSSA and MRSA showing low susceptibilities were detected in one strain each (MIC: 16 micrograms/ml and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively). Carbapenems showed high activities against Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli. Meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Quinolone resistant E. coli decreased in this year compared with those in the last year, that percentage was less than 5%. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. MEPM and carumonam (CRMN) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. On the other hand, one strain of K. pneumoniae showing resistance to cefaclor (CCL) and one strain of P. mirabilis showing low susceptibility to most of cephems were detected. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90s of carbapenems were 8 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 16 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Epidemiology and frequency of resistance among pathogens causing urinary tract infections in 1,510 hospitalized patients: a report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (North America).
AB  - Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are an important cause of septicemia resulting in high mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays and increased healthcare costs. Periodic reviews of pathogen frequency and susceptibility patterns impact on appropriate antimicrobial usage, leading to more effective prescribing practices. As part of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (SENTRY, 1998), participants collected 50 consecutive UTI pathogens from patients hospitalized in 31 medical centers (26 in the United States and five in Canada) and forwarded subcultures to the coordinating center. Thirty-four antimicrobial agents were tested including two investigational compounds (quinupristin/dalfopristin [Q/D], gatifloxacin). The rank order of the 32 species identified during the study was: Escherichia coli (46.9%) > Enterococcus spp. (12.8%) > Klebsiella spp. (11.0%) > Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%) > Proteus mirabilis (5.0%) > coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 3.4%). This pathogen rank order did not change from 1997 to 1998, but resistance patterns changed. Clonal spread of confirmed extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains was not observed, but co-resistance was elevated for aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones. P. aeruginosa was most susceptible to amikacin (97.3%) > piperacillin +/- tazobactam (92.0-95.6%) > cefepime = imipenem (91.2%) > ceftazidime (85.8%). Fluoroquinolone resistance was greater in P. aeruginosa (24.8-39.8%) > P. mirabilis (5.3-13.3%) > Enterobacter spp. (6.7-8.9%) > Klebsiella spp. (4.2-7.8%) > E. coli (3.0-3.8%). Only 5% of enterococci were resistant to vancomycin. These results emphasize the need for continued surveillance studies for common infections which establish baseline resistance patterns by geographic areas, and have the potential to detect epidemics or direct local epidemiologic interventions.
TI  - [Determination of the antibacterial and antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata (Griseb.) Epling].
AB  - The in vitro antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PrV). The viral inhibition was assayed employing viral plaque reduction assay. The antiviral activity of the essential oil specifically affects PrV and HSV-1 multiplication, since it was found that non toxic effects on cells were observed at the concentrations assayed. The therapeutic index values were 10.0 and 9.5 for HSV-1 and PrV, respectively. The antibacterial activity was studied using a diffusion assay and the broth tube dilution method. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oil than the gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil of M. verticillata was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) technique. Of the six components identified in the volatile oil, pulegone (44.56%) and menthone (39.51%) were the major constituents. The antimicrobial activity can be explained to some extent by the presence of pulegone. Results suggest that further investigations concerning the isolation of the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity and an effort to define the mechanisms of action are warranted.
TI  - Dental unit waterlines: review and product evaluation.
AB  - Dental practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding microbial contamination and  biofilm formation in dental unit waterlines. Education should stress the need for improvement in the quality of water delivered to patients during treatment. Manufacturers must also play an important role by providing training and education regarding the proper use and maintenance of their systems. Dental facilities, both public and private, need reliable methods to prevent the development of biofilms within DUWs. These methods must be economical and require minimal effort to use on the part of the dental staff. In order for the system to work efficiently, the effluent water that is produced must be compatible with dental materials and be potentially free from toxic or carcinogenic materials. There are numerous models of water filtration units and chemical flushes available to the dental practitioner. However, the Food and Drug Administration have not approved all products currently on the market. Our evaluation of Zerosil, a new waterline-cleaning product, indicates that it is very easy to use and is extremely effective in killing the commonly found microorganisms in dental unit waterlines, as well as eliminating existing biofilms. It is also economical and requires minimum staff time to keep the waterlines clean. Following the initial treatments during week one, the water emanating from the DUWs was free from any viable microorganisms. This effect was present the entire three weeks in which the waterlines were treated. The elimination of viable microorganisms continued into a fourth study week, even though no further treatment of the DUWs was performed. Although the manufacturer recommends weekly treatment of DUWs following the initial treatment regimen, this result indicates that the product has a longer lasting effect than previously thought. Finally, the product can be delivered through any of the commercially available reservoir/bottle water delivery systems. From our study, Zerosil appears to meet the demanding requirements of keeping dental unit waterlines clean. Based on the research that has been done thus far, no universal treatment protocol can be recommended. A combination of approaches may offer the best available assurance of high-quality dental treatment water. Independent water reservoir systems, when used with a periodic chemical treatment protocol, have demonstrated safety and efficacy. Until we reach a point when a recommendation based on thorough evaluations can be made, dental offices should follow current ADA, OSAP, and CDC guidelines: flush waterlines for two to three minutes at the beginning of each day and for 20 to 30 seconds between each patient, and anti-retraction valves should be installed to prevent oral fluids from being drawn into dental waterlines. It is expected that in the near future, the dental practitioner will have a choice of proven systems and products to deal with this issue. Until that time, one should carefully evaluate any product or system being considered to prevent the formation of biofilms in DUWs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Alstonia macrophylla: a folklore of bay islands.
AB  - The methanolic crude and methanol-aqueous extract of Alstonia macrophylla leaves  and n-butanol part of the crude extract showed antimicrobial activity against various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. mentagrophytes and Microsporum gypseum. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranges from 64 to 1000 microg/ml for bacteria and 32-128 mg/ml for dermatophytes. However, the strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp. and Vibrio cholerae showed resistance against in vitro treatment of the extracts up to 2000 microg/ml concentration, while the two yeast species were resistant even at 128 mg/ml concentration. The stem bark extract prepared similarly was found to be less active compared to the leaves. Phytochemical study indicates that the crude extract contains tannins, flavonoids, saponins, sterols, triterpene and reducing sugars. Further fractionation and purification of n-butanol part of the extract showed the presence of beta-sitosterol, ursolic acid, beta-sitosterol glucoside and a mixture of minor compounds only detected in TLC.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Urinary tract infections in general practice in a rural community in South Trinidad.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prospective study was carried out at a General Practice in South Trinidad, to assess the sensitivity profiles of urinary isolates in this remote rural community. METHODS: Quantitative bacteriologic cultures were performed according to standard procedures. Identification of isolates was based on gram reaction, morphology and biochemical reactions. Susceptibility testing was carried out using commonly prescribed antimicrobials for the treatment of urinary tract infections. RESULTS: From 779 urine specimens, 49% were culture positive for counts >105 organisms per ml. Three hundred and eighteen were aged 21 years and above and 85.5% of these were females. The lowest incidence of urinary tract infections, 8%, was seen among the 13-20 year old age group. Most males above 50 years had indwelling urethral catheters due to prostatic disease. Escherichia coli was the predominant isolate, 71%, followed by Proteus mirabilis, 9%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7%. All urinary tract infections isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin and >96% (except for Citrobacter species, 63%) were sensitive to cefuroxime. Apart from Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, the overall sensitivity to ampicillin by all isolates was <33%. The prevalence of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. All Pseudomonas aeruginosa were fully sensitive to gentamicin and ofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of single and multiple antibiotic resistances in this rural community should cause alarm. The ease of procuring antibiotics in these areas without a prescription can result in uncontrolled self-medication. Also, the absence of antibiotic prescribing policies and inadequate information on patterns of bacterial resistance, may all contribute to the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - [Increased antibacterial activity of antibiotics with etonium in vitro].
AB  - The activity of compositions of antibiotics cefasolin, benzylpenicillin and gentamycin with etonium in respect to museum strains Staphylococcus aureus 209, Escherichia coli K-12, Proteus vulgaris 410, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 19, Klebsiella pneumoniae 5054 and polyresistance strains S. aureus, E. coli, P. mirabilis in vitro was researched. The increase of the compositions activity as a result of synergy in the action of their component 4 up to 4496 times has been established.
TI  - The development of the BSAC standardized method of disc diffusion testing.
AB  - The BSAC Working Party on Susceptibility Testing has developed a standardized method of disc susceptibility testing that has been 'field tested' in 19 diagnostic laboratories in the UK and Ireland. The method employs semi-defined media, a semi-confluent inoculum and relates zones of inhibition with BSAC-specified MIC breakpoints to interpret susceptibility. The bacteria selected for the trial included clinical isolates and control strains from the ATCC and NCTC national collections. Organisms were chosen because they had known attributes, such as being fully susceptible or having a demonstrated mechanism of resistance. The results from this survey are very encouraging. With the commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae, specifically Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp., no major problems were observed except with gentamicin and cefuroxime. In the case of gentamicin, problems were associated with resistant strains of P. mirabilis, with MICs of 2 mg/L, being falsely reported as susceptible. For cefuroxime, it is not unexpected that results were unreliable, as the MIC distribution straddles the in vitro breakpoint concentration (following the results of this study the MIC and zone diameter breakpoints have been amended to improve reporting). No major problems were encountered for Pseudomonas aeruginosa with the agents studied. The 'field survey' has shown that disc testing is unreliable for determining the susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci to teicoplanin, and that the detection of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci is improved by incubation for a full 24 h. Inconsistencies observed with fastidious organisms were associated with incorrect inocula. Zone diameter data for the control strains studied provide information that can be utilized by diagnostic laboratories to monitor the daily performance of testing.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the conjunctiva and nasal cavity in normal and diseased captive bustards.
AB  - A survey was carried out to describe the normal aerobic bacterial flora of the conjunctiva and nasal cavity of captive houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata), kori bustards (Ardeotis kori), and white-bellied bustards (Eupodotis senegalensis) maintained at the National Avian Research Center, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. A total of 58 samples were examined from the nasal cavity and 55 samples from the conjunctiva of healthy bustards. There was no bacterial growth in 45% of conjunctival samples. Bacteria isolated from the conjunctiva of healthy birds included Micrococcus spp., Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus warneri, Bacillus spp., and Enterobacter amigenus. Bacteria isolated from the nasal cavity of healthy birds included Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., S. auricularis, S. xylosus, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus sciuri, Aerococcus spp., and Providencia rettgeri. These findings were compared with bacterial isolates from bustards with clinical signs of ocular or upper respiratory tract diseases. Mycoplasma spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, and Staphylococcus aureus were the pathogenic bacteria isolated from the conjunctiva of 34.3% bustards with ocular discharges. Mycoplasma spp., P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas spp., P. mirabilis, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. aureus were the pathogenic bacteria isolated from the nasal cavity of 74% bustards with upper respiratory tract diseases.
TI  - [Effect of bioceramics on biological activity of microorganisms].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. Thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, Bioverit, Al2O3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. RESULTS: In the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and Candida albicans were not affected. The Al2O3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. In contrast, Bioverit and Al2O3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we think that Bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.
TI  - Postantibiotic suppression effect of macrolides on the expression of flagellin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - The phenomenon of postantibiotic effect (PAE) encompasses not only the effects of bacterial growth inhibition but also the suppression of virulence factors. We tentatively designated the latter effect the postantibiotic suppression effect (PASE). The flagella of Gram-negative bacteria are involved in the development of biofilms. We measured the PASE of erythromycin (ERY) and azithromycin (AZM) on the expression of flagellin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Flagellin preparations were subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis and the flagellin band was identified by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. We thus evaluated the flagellin by the intensity of the band. The mean durations of the PAE of ERY and AZM on bacterial growth were 0.9 and 2.0 h for P. mirabilis, and 0.6 and 2.7 h for P. aeruginosa, respectively. The PASE of these drugs on flagellin expression was also observed. The apparent PASEs of ERY and AZM on flagellin were up to 5 h for P. mirabilis and up to 6 h for P. aeruginosa after a single 0.5 x minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) treatment for 5 h. Our results suggest that certain combinations of antibiotics may have prolonged suppressive effects on the expression of virulence factors in certain Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Phenotypic variability of beta-glucoside utilization and its correlation to pathogenesis process in a few enteric bacteria.
AB  - Utilization of beta-glucosides is markedly variable in the members of the family  Enterobacteriaceae. The results presented here provide molecular clues for evolutionary events that resulted in the phenotypic variability seen amongst the members of these species. The genomic hybridization of selected Enterobacteriaceae members with the Escherichia coli bgl and cel genes resulted in detection of a complete homolog of the bgl and cel operons in Shigella sonnei, a member that is evolutionarily closest to E. coli. However, the Salmonella group of organisms have been shown to carry only a homolog of bglR and bglG regions and the deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. Similarly, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and a non-enteric Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to carry a homolog of the bglR and bglG regions and deletions of the bglF and bglB genes. The homolog of the cel operon could be identified in S. sonnei and Salmonella groups of organisms. Possible implications of these observations, in connection with the phenotypic variability seen in beta-glucoside utilization amongst these members, are discussed.
TI  - [Pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  - The bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by Streptococcus faecalis (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and Proteus mirabilis (6%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary infections in children. Fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. In hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. These treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.
TI  - The influence of plasma on the disinfecting activity of the new antimicrobial agent N-chlorotaurine-sodium in comparison with chloramine T.
AB  - The phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of N-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine T for comparison. Chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (N-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine T: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). Killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, Streptococcus pyogenes and Proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in Staphylococcus aureus. With chloramine T, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. The chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of activated C-H compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of N-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. The initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. The increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal N-chloro compounds by which the loss of N-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.
TI  - Synthesis of Mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - 5-Phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. The structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (IR, 1H-NMR, EIMS) methods. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. Compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/mL respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against S. flexneri (MIC: both 312.5 micrograms/mL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
TI  - [Bacteriologic evaluation of otitis externa and chronic otitis media].
AB  - The authors present results of bacteriological examinations in 187 patients with  chronic otitis media (OMC) and otitis externa treated in ENT Department, Medical University of Gdansk in the years 1997-1998. Ear swabs and aspirates were investigated for aerobes and anaerobes 254 bacterial isolates were obtained. Among 150 patients with OMC aerobes were isolated in 130 (86.7%) in 13 (8.5%) mixed aero-anaerobes flore and in 20 (19.3%) no bacterial growth was observed. From patients with COM there were 199 bacterial isolates among them 177 aerobes cultures, 13 anaerobes and 9 fungal. From the external ear canal there were 55 cultures, among them 45 (81.8%) aerobes, 6 (10.9%) mixed aero-anerobes and 4 (7.3%) fungal. The most frequent observed bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis which showed the best susceptibility on ciprofloxacine and amikacine.
TI  - A survey of gram-negative bacteria survival on hospital fabrics and plastics.
AB  - One critical factor for the transmission of microorganisms from person to person  or from the environment to a person (patient or health care worker) is the ability of the microbe to survive on an environmental surface. The purpose of this study was to determine the length of survival of various gram-negative bacteria on fabrics and plastics commonly used in hospitals. Seven materials were tested: smooth cotton (clothing), cotton terry (towels), 60% cotton-40% polyester blend (scrub suits and lab coats), polyester (drapes), 75% nylon-25% spandex (pressure garments), polyvinyl (splash aprons), and polyurethane (keyboard covers). The following bacteria were tested: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter species, and Enterobacter species. Swatches of the materials were inoculated with defined amounts of bacteria and assayed at regular intervals. Survival was dependent on the bacterium, its inoculum size, and the material tested. At 102 microorganisms per swatch, bacteria survived from less than 1 hour to 8 days. At 10(4) to 10(5) bacteria per swatch, survival ranged from 2 hours to more than 60 days. These findings emphasize the need for careful disinfection and conscientious contact control procedures in areas that serve immunosuppressed individuals, such as patients with burn injuries.
TI  - Influence of human wet cerumen on the growth of common and pathogenic bacteria of the ear.
AB  - The available data on the effect of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth are not conclusive. Nevertheless it is widely accepted that cerumen has a bactericidal effect. In this study the activity of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth was assessed by applying cerumen suspensions to bacterial cultures. Bacterial counts were performed before and after application of cerumen suspensions. A total of 383 assays was carried out with 73 pools of cerumen that were tested against cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. An increase in growth occurred much more frequently than a decrease in growth in almost every microrganism tested, with the mean increase percentage being much higher than the mean decrease percentage, except in the case of S. aureus. The largest average growth increase was obtained with E. coli. The largest average decrease in bacterial growth was recorded with S. marcescens. Our study does not support the conception of a decrease in bacterial growth produced by humen wet cerumen. In vitro, the most observable effect was in fact an increase in microbial growth.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of topical ofloxacin and other ototopical agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ototopical agents are extensively used for otitis externa (OE), acute otitis media identified by otorrhea in patients who have tympanostomy tubes (AOM-TT) and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The quinolones have particular value as ototopical agents because of the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity of importance in otic diseases and the high concentrations of antibacterial activity at the site of infection. METHODS: A survey of literature on in vitro activity and microbiologic efficacy in clinical trials of quinolone otic products for OE, AOM-TT and CSOM. RESULTS: OE: Floxin otic and Cortisporin TC otic suspension were equally effective in eradicating the three major pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. CSOM: Ofloxacin otic was effective in an open label trial in uniform eradication of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. AOM-TT: Ofloxacin otic and amoxicillin/clavulanate (by mouth) were equivalent clinically; rates of eradication of initial pathogens were similar for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but ofloxacin otic was superior in eradication of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa CONCLUSIONS: In each of the studies of OE, CSOM and AOM-TT, ofloxacin otic solution was effective in eradicating the bacterial pathogen from the site of infection: equivalent to Cortisporin for children with OE; superior to amoxicillin/clavulanate for patients with AOM-TT who had acute drainage; and effective in eradicating bacterial pathogens from the external canal of patients with CSOM.
TI  - Resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  - Multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. Among Gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Important causes of Gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation cephalosporin (Amp C) beta-lactamase resistance among Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. In selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. Antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should not further promote the development of resistance. Recent data suggest that because of ESBLs and high-level amp C beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. In addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. The role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. Available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. In addition, several new agents with good activity against Gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. Appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - [Bact-Alert system for hemocultures: evaluation of terminal subcultures].
AB  - Few laboratory microbiological procedures are as important as the isolation of microorganisms from blood. To evaluate the usefulness of the terminal subcultures, 5669 blood cultures giving negative results after 7 days of incubation in the Bact/Alert System (Organon Teknika) were studied. Bottles were distributed as follows: 1562 adult aerobic bottles, 119 adult anaerobic bottles, 3960 pediatric bottles and 28 FAN bottles. From 5669 blood cultures, 10 subcultures that yielded growth had not been detected by the system. These included 5 adult aerobic bottles and 5 pediatric bottles, 7 of these microorganisms were considered contaminants according to clinical data (2 Micrococcus spp, 1 staphylococci coagulase negative, 1 Burkholderia cepacia, 1 Peptoestreptococcus spp, 1 Corynebacterium spp, 1 Scedosporium spp) while the other 3 were considered true bacteremia (1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Streptococcus sanguis), although no one made any change in treatment on the basis of the previous isolation. Based on these results the routinary utilization of terminal subcultures is not advisable and should be used only for special cases or a second system of blood culture should be added according to clinical or epidemiological data.
TI  - Assessment of the capacity of Lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - To gain insight into the mechanisms by which Lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 Lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. Lactobacilli from hemagglutination group III, identified as Lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups II and I (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA5 and Klebsiella pneumoniae KP7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and Staphylococcus aureus SA11 and Proteus mirabilis PM1 were the most resistant. Lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 Lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). P. aeruginosa PA5 was the most inhibited, and Enterococcus species E15 was the least inhibited. There is considerable variation among Lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen growth. Although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of a method using Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to experimentally induce dual infection of the urinary bladder in dogs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a method using Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to experimentally induce dual infection of the urinary bladder in dogs. ANIMALS: 6 healthy mixed-breed dogs. PROCEDURE: Dogs were anesthetized, and cystitis was induced by infusing a solution of salicylic acid in ethanol into the bladder, followed by an inoculum containing field isolates of P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa. Dogs were examined daily for 21 days after induction of cystitis. On day 21, dogs were euthanatized, and urinary bladder, renal pelvis, and prostate specimens were submitted for bacterial culture. RESULTS: After induction of cystitis, all dogs had evidence of thickening of the bladder wall, dysuria, tenesmus, and hematuria. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria. All urine samples obtained on day 21 yielded growth of P. mirabilis, but P. aeruginosa was not cultured from any of these samples. Proteus mirabilis was isolated from bladder, renal pelvis, or prostate specimens from 4 dogs; P. aeruginosa was not isolated from any of the tissue specimens. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the method used in the present study fails to induce dual infection of the urinary bladder with P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa. The inability to establish a persistent dual infection with this method may have been a result of insufficient pathogenicity of the Pseudomonas isolate or an inadequacy of the experimental design.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis dry extract.
AB  - In this study the antibacterial and antifungal properties of propolis, a natural  product of bees, have been investigated against different pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined according to NCCLS standards on 320 strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Time-kill curves were assessed for susceptible microorganisms, testing 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x MIC for propolis, by counting viable bacteria after 0, 3, 6, 24 hours and viable yeasts after 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours. Propolis showed good antimicrobial activity against most of the isolates, particularly S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, but not against Enterobacteriaceae. Time-kill curves demonstrated bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal activity of propolis, the latter being evident only at high concentrations.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to silver nitrate coated poly-L-lactic acid urological stents in vitro.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to see whether it is possible to prevent bacterial  adherence to bioabsorbable self-reinforced L-lactic acid polymer (SR-PLLA) urological stents. The SR-PLLA stents were coated with silver nitrate blended epsilon-caprolactone/L-lactide copolymer. The adherence of five bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and two strains of Escherichia coli) to coated and non-coated SR-PLLA wires were tested. It was found that silver nitrate coating prevented the adherence of bacteria (except E. faecalis) to SR-PLLA stents. The preventive effect correlated with the silver nitrate concentration. It was also found that silver nitrate coating reduced the amount of bacteria in ambient urine. In conclusion, silver nitrate coating may reduce stent-associated bacterial infections by preventing the adherence of bacteria. Further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in clinical practice.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to ofloxacin-blended polylactone-coated self-reinforced L-lactic acid polymer urological stents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ofloxacin coating has any effect on bacterial adherence to bioresorbable self-reinforced L-lactic acid polymer (SR-PLLA) urological stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SR-PLLA stents were coated with epsilon-caprolactone/L-lactide copolymer blended with ofloxacin at three different concentrations of ofloxacin (0.5, 2 and 5% w/w). The adherence of five bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and two strains of Escherichia coli) to the coated SR-PLLA stents was analysed. Uncoated stent pieces were used as controls. The effect of ofloxacin coating on bacterial growth in the microenvironment of the stent pieces was also analysed. RESULTS: Ofloxacin coating prevented bacterial adherence to SR-PLLA stent material; this effect correlated significantly with the ofloxacin concentration of the caprolactone coating. Ofloxacin coating reduced the amount of bacteria in the microenvironment of the stent, but because of natural resistance, ofloxacin coating had little effect on E. faecalis. CONCLUSION: Except for E. faecalis, ofloxacin coating may reduce stent-associated infections. However, further studies are needed to confirm its biocompatibility and efficacy in clinical use.
TI  - Orbital abscess: management and outcome.
AB  - PURPOSE: To discuss the diagnosis, management and outcome of various types of orbital abscess. METHODS: The medical records of 13 patients diagnosed and treated for orbital abscess were reviewed. The sources of infection included: paranasal sinusitis (n = 5), odontogenic origin of infection (n = 4), one each, temporal fossa abscess, palatal abscess, furuncle on the nose, and secondary to retrobulbar injection of steroid. Computed tomographic scans revealed the presence of an abscess in all 13 cases. Associated findings on CT scan included: sinus disease (n = 8), cavernous sinus thrombosis (n = 2) and subdural empyema (n = 2). All patients were treated with intensive, multiple, intravenous antibiotics and early surgical drainage. RESULTS: Purulent material collected surgically from the orbit cultured Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), two each Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter species and one each beta-haemolytic Streptococci, Citrobacter frundi and Enterobacter. Final visual acuity was good in 6 patients (6/12-6/6) and no light perception in 6 others. Visual acuity could not be recorded in the infant. The other complications were intracranial abscess (n = 4), cavernous sinus thrombosis (n = 2) and restricted ocular motility (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion is necessary, along with early institution of appropriate diagnostic imaging, and aggressive medical and surgical treatment for a favourable outcome in cases of orbital abscess.
TI  - Impact of fluoroquinolone administration on the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant gram-negative bacilli from gastrointestinal flora.
AB  - We assessed the risk factors for acquisition of fluoroquinolone-resistant, gram-negative organisms in the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized patients. We analyzed stool samples from 204 patients and recovered fluoroquinolone-resistant, gram-negative organisms from 63. Receipt of fluoroquinolone during the month preceding admission was the only risk factor identified, whereas female sex, duration of hospitalization, exposure to indwelling devices, admission from another hospital, and history of infection were risk factors for fecal colonization after day 4.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - In vitro activity of gatifloxacin compared with gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against uropathogens cultured from patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of gatifloxacin were compared with those of gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin using an agar dilution method for 400 uropathogens cultured from the urine of urological patients with complicated and/or hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI). The collection of strains was made up of Enterobacteriaceae (34.5%), enterococci (31.5%), staphylococci (21.2%) and non-fermenting bacteria (12.8%). The antibacterial activity of the three newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin, were similar, but showed some drug specific differences. Gemifloxacin was most active against Escherichia coli, but less so against Proteus mirabilis. In this series all isolates of E. coli were inhibited at a MIC of 0.25 mg/l gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin and by 0.125 mg/l gemifloxacin. The MIC distribution of all fluoroquinolones showed a bimodal distribution for staphylococci, enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The two modes for P. aeruginosa were 1 and 64 mg/l for gemifloxacin and moxifloxacin and 0.5 and 64 mg/l for gatifloxacin. For staphylococci the two modes were 0.125 and 2 mg/l for gatifloxacin, 0.03 and 4 mg/l for gemifloxacin, and 0.03 and 2 mg/l for moxifloxacin; for enterococci, 0.25 and 16 mg/l for gatifloxacin, 0.06 and 2 mg/l for gemifloxacin, and 0.25 and 8 mg/l for moxifloxacin. Compared with trovafloxacin the MICs were similar, but the newer fluoroquinolones were more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. Of the newer fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin had the highest rate of renal excretion and could be considered a promising alternative fluoroquinolone agent for the treatment of UTI.
TI  - Integron-located VEB-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene in a Proteus mirabilis clinical isolate from Vietnam.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis Lil-1 was obtained from a Vietnamese patient hospitalized in Paris, France. This isolate was resistant to cephalosporins, and there was marked synergy between cephalosporins and clavulanic acid together with unusual synergy between cefoxitin and cefuroxime. PCR analysis revealed the presence of blaVEB-1, an integron-located gene coding for an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) identified previously in an Escherichia coli isolate MG-1 from Vietnam. Using class 1 integron primers and blaVEB-1 intragenic primers, the insert region of the blaVEB-1-containing integron along with flanking sequences were amplified from P. mirabilis Lil-1 whole-cell DNA. A novel class 1 integron, In55, was identified that contained, in addition to intI1, qacEDelta1, sul1 and Orf5 genes, an 8 kb variable region. This region was comparable in size to that found previously in E. coli MG-1, but different from those previously identified in two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Thailand. In55 was located on a 190 kb self-transferable plasmid, which was different in size and structure from that found in E. coli MG-1. The finding of blaVEB-1 on different plasmids and integrons in enterobacterial isolates underlines the interspecies spread of this novel ESBL gene.
TI  - Effect of subinhibitory concentrations of macrolides on expression of flagellin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - In the present study we showed by molecular analysis that the inhibition of motility by macrolides in Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was well correlated with the loss of the expression of flagellin. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin at subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) suppressed the expression of flagellin dose dependently. Azithromycin had the strongest inhibitory effect on the expression of P. aeruginosa flagellin, whereas 16-membered rokitamycin had only a weak inhibitory effect. These results indicate the potential effectiveness of sub-MICs of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for the treatment of patients with P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa infections.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic otitis media in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the aetiology of chronic otitis media (COM) in Dar es Salaam and to find out the shelf life of boric acid in spirit ear drops (BAISED). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Muhimbili Medical Centre and selected primary schools within Dar es Salaam. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacterial isolates and their sensitivity patterns and shelf life of BAISED. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy six pus swab specimens obtained from 150 patients with COM for more than three months were submitted for culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing in 1997. RESULTS: The isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (51.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (17.2%), Proteus mirabilis (13.2%), Klebsiella spp. (8.0%), Escherichia coli (5.8%) and unidentified coliforms in 4.0%. All isolates were sensitive to gentamicin. Sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis to kanamycin was 98.5% and 100%, respectively. P. aeruginosa was sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and tetracycline by 58.1%, 10.1% and 8.3%, respectively. Three per cent BAISED inhibited the growth of all Pseudomonas aeruginosa even after it has been stored at room temperature for six weeks. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the drug of choice for management of COM in Dar es Salaam is gentamicin. However, given its ototoxicity effects and the fact that BAISED is effective and affordable, the later should be the treatment of choice.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
AB  - 4-Carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (I-IV) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. Furthermore, I-IV were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (V-VIII). V was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (IX-XIV). The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton Agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds, XI and XIV showed activity against S. aureus (MIC: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound V had an activity against S. flexneri (MIC: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound I against C. albicans (MIC: 125 (micrograms/ml). Compounds I, IV-XIV were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. Only compounds I and XIV showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
TI  - Waste water bacterial isolates resistant to heavy metals and antibiotics.
AB  - Sewage water of Casablanca, an industrial city in Morocco, was studied for microorganisms resistant to heavy metals. Isolates were purified and collected on agar slants to be screened for resistance to heavy metals, including mercury in vitro. The strains that showed high resistance to heavy metals were also studied for their resistance to antibiotics and aromatic hydrocarbons. Results indicated that the strains most resistant to all tested products belonged to Ps. fluorescens, Ps. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus sp. These strains exhibit high minimal inhibitory concentrations for heavy metals such as cadmium (2 mm) or mercury (1.2 mm). Growth of Ps. fluorescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the presence of heavy metals was also determined, and the growth curves indicated that mercury, copper, and zinc present a slight inhibitory action, while cadmium and silver could have a potent inhibitory action on growth compared with the controls. These studies also investigated growth in media containing aromatic compounds as the sole source of carbon. The results demonstrate that these strains could be good candidates for remediation of some heavy metals and aromatic compounds in heavily polluted sites.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1998). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of bacterial isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 538 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1998 to May 1999. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.3% and Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.7%. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Enterococcus faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs, vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) had strong activities. Among E. faecalis strains, those with low susceptibilities to all drugs have increased in 1998, compared with those in 1997. VCM showed the highest activity against MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs of VCM for all 34 strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active against MRSA with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. Against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, all drugs except penicillins were active. Particularly, meropenem (MEPM) showed the highest activity with the MICs of 0.125 micrograms/ml or below. Almost all the drugs except minocycline (MINO) showed high activities against Proteus mirabilis. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all drugs were not so active, with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. MEPM, IPM and gentamicin (GM) showed high activities against Serratia marcescens. Generally, it seemed that resistant strains of S. marcescens had decreased since 1996.
TI  - Cefditoren activity against nearly 1000 non-fastidious bacterial isolates and the development of in vitro susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Cefditoren (formerly ME-1206) is an investigational, orally administered cephalosporin ester with bactericidal activity against many Gram-positive and -negative organisms. Cefditoren potency against nearly 1000 non-fastidious species was determined by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. Against staphylococci, usable cefditoren activity was completely correlated with oxacillin with respect to potency and susceptibility interpretation (mec A-negative strains). Cefditoren was very active against Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli (MIC(90) range, 0.12-1 microg/ml; median zone, 23-26 mm). Cefditoren had more limited activity against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and indole-positive Proteae (MIC(50) range, 0.12-1 microg/ml; MIC(90), > 16 microg/ml; median zone, 18-25 mm). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and other non-fermentors, cefditoren was inactive (MIC(90), > 16 microg/ml; zone, 6 mm). Pharmacokinetic analysis of cefditoren showed that utilized dosages produce a plasma concentration that exceeds 0.5 microg/ml for 5 to 8 h and 1 microg/ml for 4 to 6 hours (T(1/2) ranges from 1.5-2 h). The following interpretive criteria were suggested: </= 2 microg/ml or >/= 15 mm (susceptible) and >/= 8 microg/ml or </= 11 mm (resistance) that yielded an intermethod categorical agreement of 95.8% and very major or major error rates of 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. Alternatively, </= 1 microg/ml or >/= 18 mm (susceptible) and >/= 4 microg/ml or </= 14 mm (resistant) breakpoints resulted in 96.2% accuracy and combined serious errors of only 1.1%. Cefditoren was observed to be a very active cephalosporin ranking among the most potent available orally active beta-lactams for use against a wide variety of pathogens.
TI  - Respiratory pathogen colonization of the dental plaque of institutionalized elders.
AB  - Although it has been established that aspiration of pharyngeal bacteria is the major route of infection in the development of nosocomial pneumonia, colonization of the pharyngeal mucosa by respiratory pathogens has been shown to be a transient phenomenon. It has been suggested that the dental plaque may constitute an additional, possibly more stable, reservoir of respiratory pathogens. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral colonization by potential respiratory pathogens in a group of elderly (mean age = 75.9 yrs) chronic-care-facility residents (n = 28) and a group of age-, gender-, and race-matched outpatient control subjects (n = 30), with specific attention to plaque present on tooth, denture, and oral mucosal surfaces. Plaque scores on teeth and dentures were significantly higher in the chronic-care-facility (CCF) subjects than in the dental outpatient control (DOC) subjects (PII 2.3 vs. 1.2 and denture plaque 1.4 vs. 0.3). While no subjects in the DOC group were found to be colonized with respiratory pathogens (> 1.0% of the cultivable aerobic flora), 14.3% (4/28) of the CCF subjects were found to be colonized. Oral colonization with respiratory pathogens in CCF subjects was associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and higher plaque scores. These results suggest that deficient dental plaque control and the presence of COPD may be related to respiratory pathogen colonization of dental plaque in chronic-care-facility residents.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the United States and The Netherlands. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of pH on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. The MICs of American and Dutch isolates agreed in general. The MICs of the American gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of the Dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. A few European strains of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high MICs. Bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. The MICs of the American gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of Dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml. Difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Decreasing the pH of the medium increased the MIC of Proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. The MICs of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral pH and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. At a neutral pH, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4 times the MIC. Similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. A Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin MIC, but at neutral pH the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the MIC for a bactericidal effect. After 24 hours of incubation at pH 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except Staphylococcus intermedius. Against S. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of urinary pathogens isolated in the microbiology and virology laboratory of the Careggi General Hospital in the period July-December 1996].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility of pathogens isolated form urinocoltures. METHODS: 2192 bacterial strains obtained from urine cultures with bacterial count > 100,000 UFC/ml were examined in our Laboratory from July through December 1996. Inpatients as well as outpatients were considered. Five different ward typologies were taken into account (Surgery, Medicine, Obstetrics, Spinal Unit and High Risk Wards). Isolation frequencies were evaluated for each ward, but in order to get an adequate statistical sample they were divided into in two categories, e.g. strains isolated from inpatients and from outpatients. Antibiotic susceptibility was also evaluated dividing the data into the same two categories. For strains isolated with lower frequencies that was not possible, and data from inpatients were grouped with data from outpatients. RESULTS: The results obtained show that bacterial species most frequently isolated among inpatients are Escherichia coli (45.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (16.8%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). Those most frequently isolated among outpatients are Escherichia coli (58.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.3%), Proteus mirabilis (9.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.4%) and Coagulase negative staphylococci (4.0%). As far as antibiotic susceptibility is concerned, whenever a statistically significant difference in sensitivity could be observed between strains isolated from inpatients and strains isolated from outpatients, sensitivity was always higher for outpatients strains. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation frequency and antibiotic susceptibility are different depending on the place of origin of the patients (inpatients/outpatients). This implies a different approach to the empiric therapy in urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Descriptive study of infectious ear disease in relation to summer].
AB  - A descriptive study was made of infectious ear disease (including diffuse otitis  externa, otomycosis, acute-on-chronic otitis media, and superinfection of a radical mastoidectomy cavity) in relation to changes of weather and habits in summer. During the months of June, July, and August 1996, 179 patients were evaluated in the emergency room of the Alicante General University Hospital, Spain. Average patient age at presentation was 30.52 (+/- 20.08) years and 56% were men. The most frequent disease was diffuse otitis externa (78%) followed by acute-on-chronic otitis media (12%), otomycosis (8%), and superinfection of a radical mastoidectomy cavity (2%). The most frequently involved microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in diffuse otitis externa, Aspergillus niger and Candida in otomycosis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus in acute-on-chronic otitis media. Patients were treated by cleaning detritus and secretions, usually followed by topical antibiotics for a maximum period of one week.
TI  - Intracranial complications of acute mastoiditis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oral antibiotic use may have changed the incidence and microbiology of otitic intracranial complications. We reviewed cases of acute mastoiditis to document: (1) incidence of intracranial complications; (2) risk factors; and (3) identify pathologic organisms. METHODS: A retrospective study of children at a tertiary care children's hospital with acute mastoiditis from July, 1986 through June, 1998. RESULTS: 118 children with acute mastoiditis were identified. Eight patients (6.8%), ages 20 months to 14 years, had intracranial complications related to acute mastoiditis. Three children had a sigmoid sinus thrombosis, two children had an epidural abscess, and two children had both complications of sigmoid sinus thrombosis and epidural abscess, and a sigmoid sinus thrombosis and meningitis was present in one child. Pre-admission oral antibiotics were administered for an average of 10 days in seven of the eight patients. Persistent otorrhea and/or otalgia were present in all patients. Intraoperative cultures were negative in four cases (50%). Organisms isolated included: Streptococcus pneumoniae (2); Proteus mirabilis (1); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1); and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (1). Multi-drug resistant organisms were documented in only one case. All patients underwent a contrast enhanced CT of the temporal bones and brain. Surgical management included complete mastoidectomy in all patients and a pressure equalization tube in seven of the eight cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our review did not document an increase in the incidence of otitic intracranial complications. Persistent otalgia or otorrhea while on oral antibiotics with associated neurologic symptoms are ominous signs suggestive of a complication. Multi-drug resistant organisms are uncommon whereas negative intraoperative cultures are common.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of the new glycylcycline, GAR-936 tested against 1,203 recent clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GAR-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and several other antimicrobial agents. A total of 1,203 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth or agar dilution methods. Among the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, GAR-936 was generally two- to four-fold more active than minocycline, and two- to 16-fold more active than tetracycline. All enteric bacilli MIC90 results were < or = 4 microg/mL; the exception being Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteae (> or = 8 microg/mL). GAR-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all gram-positive cocci with 90% of the penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates inhibited at 0.03 microg/ml, while the same isolates had a MIC90 of 8 and > 8 microg/mL for minocycline and tetracycline, respectively. All Enterococcus spp., including vancomycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at 0.25 microg/mL of GAR-936 (MIC90, 0.12 or 0.25 microg/mL). Although GAR-936 (MIC50, 0.25 microg/mL) was two-fold less active than minocycline (MIC50, 0.12 microg/mL) against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, all isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microg/mL. GAR-936 demonstrated good activity against nonfermentative bacteria such as Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90, 2 microg/ml) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 microg/mL), but the compound exhibited only modest activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50, 8 microg/mL). Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 1-2 microg/mL), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 microg/mL), and various Neisseria spp. (MIC90, 0.12-0.5 microg/mL) were susceptible to GAR-936. These results indicate that GAR-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria, and that several gram-positive and -negative isolates resistant to older tetracyclines and other drug classes remain susceptible to GAR-936, the newest glycylcycline candidate for clinical use.
TI  - Three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in Argentina. The Antimicrobial Committee; and the National Surveillance Program (SIR) Participants Group.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A national surveillance program (SIR) was introduced in 1996 in Argentina by the Antimicrobial Committee of the Argentinean Society for Microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. The present study reports the rates of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. METHODS: A 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., April-May and October-November) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 Argentinean centers. Susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: In all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. Methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), respectively. Although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the S. aureus and CNS strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. No ampicillin resistance was displayed by Enterococcus faecalis. High-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. Acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). Imipenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. Among Enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. Ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the E. cloacae strains. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli isolates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in Argentina.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Investigation of plants used in Jamaican folk medicine for anti-bacterial activity.
AB  - We have started a systematic scientific study of folklore medicinal plants currently used as alternative medicine in Jamaican society. In this initial study, extracts of plants widely used by the islanders are studied for antibacterial activity against five common pathogens; Streptococcus group A, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. These studies revealed that 25% (approx.) of the plant extracts had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes used. Subsequent to these observations, extracts from Mikania micrantha were examined in detail. This led to the isolation of two sesquiterpenoids, mikanolide and dihydromikanolide, with activity against S. aureus and C. albicans. The results suggest that traditional folk medicine could be used as a guide in our continuing search for new natural products with potential medicinal properties.
TI  - Microbiologic survey of long-term care facilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We undertook a microbiologic survey of long-term care facilities to categorize bacteria found in cultures of residents. Culture and sensitivity data were collected on 566 samples from indwelling bladder catheters, percutaneous gastrostomy tubes, nares, stool, wounds, pressure ulcers, and tracheostomies in 25 Nebraska and Iowa facilities. Information was also collected on resident factors (eg, presence of indwelling urinary catheter, prior antibiotic administration) and institutional variables (eg, number of beds, nosocomial infection rates). RESULTS: There were 478 gram-negative isolates, the leading organisms being Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There were 221 gram-positive isolates, the most frequently seen of which were enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the 442 residents sampled in the study, 168 (38%) were taking, or had within the previous month been taking, a systemic antibiotic. Quinolones were the most frequently prescribed antibiotic class. The institutional prevalence of urinary catheterization averaged 6.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Significant antibiotic pressure exists in long-term care facilities, a fact that is reflected in antibiotic resistance patterns. A variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were found in nursing home culture specimens.
TI  - Biological activities of lipopolysaccharides of Proteus spp. and their interactions with polymyxin B and an 18-kDa cationic antimicrobial protein (CAP18)-derived peptide.
AB  - The saccharide constituents of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Proteus spp. vary with the strain and contain unique components about which little is known. The biological activities of LPS and lipid A from S- and R-forms of 10 Proteus strains were examined. LPS from all S-form Proteus strains was lethal to D-(+)-galactosamine (GalN)-loaded, LPS-responsive, C3H/HeN mice, but not to LPS-hypo-responsive C3H/HeJ mice. P. vulgaris 025 LPS evoked strong anaphylactoid reactions in N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP)-primed C3H/HeJ mice. LPS from S- and R-form Proteus strains induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by macrophages isolated from C3H/HeN but not C3H/HeJ mice. Lipid A from Proteus strains also induced NO and TNF production, although lipid A was less potent than LPS. The effects of LPS were mainly dependent on CD14; LPS-induced NO and TNF production in CD14+ J774.1 cells was significantly greater than in CD14-J7.DEF.3 cells. All LPS from Proteus strains, and especially from P. vulgaris 025, exhibited higher anti-complementary activity than LPS from Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polymyxin B inactivated proteus LPS in a dose-dependent manner, but these LPS preparations were more resistant to polymyxin B than E. coli LPS. CAP18(109-135), a granulocyte-derived peptide, inhibited proteus LPS endotoxicity only when the LPS:CAP18(109-135) ratio was appropriate, which suggests that CAP18(109-135) acts through a different mechanism than polymyxin B. The results indicate that LPS from Proteus spp. are potently endotoxic, but that the toxicity is different from that of LPS from E. coli or Salmonella spp. and even varies among different Proteus strains. The variation in biological activities among proteus LPS may be due to unique components within the respective LPS.
TI  - Disk diffusion susceptibility test development for the new glycylcycline, GAR-936.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GAR-936, a new semisynthetic glycylcycline, was evaluated in comparison with two tetracyclines and the disk diffusion susceptibility test was assessed. Nearly 700 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution and disk diffusion (two disk contents) methods. Among the Enterobacteriaceae, GAR-936 was generally two- to 16-fold more active than other tetracyclines. All enteric bacilli MIC90 results were < or = 4 micrograms/mL; the exception being Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteae (> or = 8 micrograms/mL). GAR-936 demonstrated excellent activity against all Gram-positive cocci with Enterococcus spp. (including vancomycin-resistant isolates) inhibited at 0.25 microgram/mL (GAR-936 MIC90, 0.12 or 0.25 microgram/mL) and the oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were inhibited at < or = 0.25 microgram/mL. GAR-936 demonstrated good potency against several non-fermentative bacteria, but possessed limited activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50, 8 micrograms/mL). In vitro susceptibility test methods were developed (disk diffusion versus reference MIC results) and tentative breakpoints were proposed. Using susceptibility criteria of either < or = 2 or < or = 4 micrograms/mL, GAR-936 in vitro susceptibility tests demonstrated rare significant serious inter-method discords (< or = 1.2%) and an absolute agreement between test results of 92.3 to 96.2%. These results indicate that GAR-936 has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of clinically important rapidly growing pathogenic bacteria, and that this novel glycylcycline candidate for clinical use should be further developed.
TI  - Interactions of "Limax amoebae" and gram-negative bacteria: experimental studies  and review of current problems.
AB  - Free-living amoebae can harbour bacteria inside their cysts giving them a microhabitat and protecting them from disinfectants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential importance of "Limax amoebae" as vectors for environmental and nosocomial bacteria in a hospital. It was shown that free-living amoebae are ubiquitous in the investigated hospital, occur syntopically with facultative human pathogens (Comamonas acidovorans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and may serve as hosts not only for these but also for bacteria isolated from clinical specimens (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa); temperature is apparently of crucial importance for the interactions between these microorganisms. Recent studies have shown that "Limax amoebae" apart from acting as protective hosts, may also play a role for the thermotolerance, invasiveness and antibiotic-resistance of bacteria. Considering also the reduced immune-status of many patients, this "symbiosis" of free-living amoebae and bacteria might still be of underestimated hospital-hygienic importance.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity of belizean plants: an improved method.
AB  - The influences of medium type, inoculum density, and a cold incubation on antimicrobial assay sensitivity were tested. The largest and most distinct zones were produced using nutrient agar and the 1/10 4 inoculum density for Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis but a 1/10 12 inoculum density for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli . The greatest number of zones were detected without cold incubation. Using this method, eight plants from Belize were screened for antibacterial activity. Six plants showed activity against the four organisms tested. Both inoculum density and medium type played important roles in assay sensitivity; however, inoculum density was of more practical significance.
TI  - Production of a TEM-24 plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum beta-lactamase by a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Several Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, including one urinary isolate producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase TEM-24, were isolated from a long-term-hospitalized woman. Three TEM-24-producing enterobacterial species (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis) were isolated from the same patient. TEM-24 and the resistance markers for aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and sulfonamide were encoded by a 180-kb plasmid transferred by conjugation into E. coli HB101.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adult post-neurosurgical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM) in adult postneurosurgical patients. METHODS: Thirty adult patients with GNBM were included in this study. Their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. The patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. Seven had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. Two patients were associated with brain abscess. RESULTS: The pathogens found in the 30 GNBM patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis. Among these 30 patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant GNBM were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. Appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. Eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. All eight died. The mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increase of GNBM in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. In addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic challenge. We noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. Therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients with nosocomially acquired GNBM, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. Early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.
TI  - Characteristics of pathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitals in North America: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 1997.
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common and involves pathogens with changing susceptibility patterns. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program evaluates international pathogen incidence patterns to detect and manage the emergence of resistant strains. We describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns among 1617 pathogens recovered from UTIs during the third-quarter of 1997 in North America (United States and Canada), as part of this worldwide program. The isolates were tested against more than 50 antimicrobial agents (20 reported) by reference broth microdilution methods, and selected isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and automated ribotyping. The five most frequently isolated species were Escherichia coli (48.6%), Enterococcus spp. (13.7%), Klebsiella spp. (12.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.2%), and Enterobacter spp. or Proteus mirabilis (3.8% each). For each nation, imipenem and cefepime produced the widest spectrum of coverage among the beta-lactams and amikacin was best among the aminoglycosides. For Gram-negative species, high resistance among beta-lactam antimicrobial agents was noted especially for various penicillins against E. coli (37.9% to 42.8%) and for the cephalosporins tested against enterococci (99.4% and 100%). Approximately 7.0% of enterococci in the USA were vancomycin-resistant (88% with Van A). P. aeruginosa provided the most consistent levels of resistance, but the following agents were most active against these organisms: amikacin (96.6 to 97.4% susceptible), tobramycin (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin/tazobactam (89.5 to 100.0%), piperacillin (89.5 to 96.6%), imipenem (89.7 to 92.1%), cefepime (77.6 to 89.7%), and ceftazidime (82.9 to 86.2%). E. coli (2.2 to 2.7%), K. pneumoniae (6.2 to 6.4%), and a single Enterobacter cloacae strain produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; and five other Enterobacter spp. were likely to have expressed chromosomally mediated (Amp C) Stably derepressed cephalosporinases with associated resistance to ceftazidime (16.7 to 21.2% resistance). These data demonstrated that several UTI isolates in SENTRY hospitals have high levels of resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents with little evidence of clonal dissemination.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Quorum-sensing cross talk: isolation and chemical characterization of cyclic dipeptides from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - In cell-free Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture supernatants, we identified two compounds capable of activating an N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) biosensor. Mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy revealed that these compounds were not AHLs but the diketopiperazines (DKPs), cyclo(DeltaAla-L-Val) and cyclo(L-Pro-L-Tyr) respectively. These compounds were also found in cell-free supernatants from Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter agglomerans [cyclo(DeltaAla-L-Val) only]. Although both DKPs were absent from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas alcaligenes, we isolated, from both pseudomonads, a third DKP, which was chemically characterized as cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro). Dose-response curves using a LuxR-based AHL biosensor indicated that cyclo(DeltaAla-L-Val), cyclo(L-Pro-L-Tyr) and cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro) activate the biosensor in a concentration-dependent manner, albeit at much higher concentrations than the natural activator N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL). Competition studies showed that cyclo(DeltaAla-L-Val), cyclo(L-Pro-L-Tyr) and cyclo(L-Phe-L-Pro) antagonize the 3-oxo-C6-HSL-mediated induction of bioluminescence, suggesting that these DKPs may compete for the same LuxR-binding site. Similarly, DKPs were found to be capable of activating or antagonizing other LuxR-based quorum-sensing systems, such as the N-butanoylhomoserine lactone-dependent swarming motility of Serratia liquefaciens. Although the physiological role of these DKPs has yet to be established, their activity suggests the existence of cross talk among bacterial signalling systems.
TI  - [Development of a vaccine for treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  - Receiving uroinfections are predominantly treated with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. An effective alternative treatment can be immunotherapy with inactivated bacteria. The authors have focused on the development of polybacterial vaccine with both specific and nonspecific immunostimulatory activity. The vaccine contains killed bacteria which most frequently occur as an etiological agent in urinary tract infections. Determining for the selection of particular strains for the vaccine preparation were their immunostimulatory properties evaluated after intraperitoneal application of killed cells to mice. The results were evaluated according to weight gain of liver and spleen and verified by histological examination of these organs. The final form of the vaccine URVAKOL contains immunogenically most active strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, representing specific effective part of the preparation, adjuvant activity is provided by Propionibacterium acnes. (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 27.)
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Ocimum gratissimum L. essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil (EO) of Ocimum gratissimum inhibited Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration of 0.75 mg/ml. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Shigella flexineri, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., and Proteus mirabilis were at concentrations ranging from 3 to 12 microg/ml. The endpoint was not reached for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (>=24 mg/ml). The MICs of the reference drugs used in this study were similar to those presented in other reports. The minimum bactericidal concentration of EO was within a twofold dilution of the MIC for this organism. The compound that showed antibacterial activity in the EO of O. gratissimum was identified as eugenol and structural findings were further supported by gas chromatography/mass spectra retention time data. The structure was supported by spectroscopic methods.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial potency of tannins and related compounds using the microdilution broth method.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of a total of 27 tannins and related compounds was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 2 Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus), 4 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis), and 2 yeasts (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). The compounds tested were generally found to possess only weak to moderate antibacterial, but fairly high anticryptococcal activities. Attention is given to structure-activity relationships with emphasis on simple galloyl esters, hydrolyzable tannins and proanthcyanidins among this class of secondary products.
TI  - Impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  - Evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. However, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. From 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of Acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens to 22 agents. Linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. Only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing D, decreasing %S) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing D, increasing %S). The mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing D, decreasing %S and decreasing D, increasing %S relationships. Multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.
TI  - In vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  - The aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of the external eye. Pure reference strain cultures of Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. Serial twofold dilutions of 2% HPMC, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. One hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. After 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. After 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. C. albicans and P. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. P. acnes and P. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. S. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. S. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. The viability of P. aeruginosa in HPMC dilutions needs to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of HPMC may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Comparative study on the in vitro antibacterial activity of Australian tea tree oil, cajuput oil, niaouli oil, manuka oil, kanuka oil, and eucalyptus oil.
AB  - To compare the antibacterial activity of the Australian tea tree oil (TTO) with various other medicinally and commercially important essential myrtaceous oils (cajuput oil, niaouli oil, kanuka oil, manuka oil, and eucalyptus oil) the essential oils were first analysed by GC-MS and then tested against various bacteria using a broth microdilution method. The highest activity was obtained by TTO, with MIC values of 0.25% for Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella choleraesuis, Shigella flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and S. xylosus. It is noteworthy that manuka oil exhibited a higher activity than TTO against gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values of 0.12%. Both TTO and manuka oil also demonstrated a very good antimicrobial efficacy against various antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to all essential oils tested, even at the highest concentration of 4%.
TI  - [A consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - The results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare during the period of January 1993 to July 1995, were analyzed for typical Gram-negative bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. During these 3 years, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (FOM) and Citrobacter freundii. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (MINO). While Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (CMZ). However, these annual changes were almost negligible. Generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against Gram-negative bacilli. However, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST), CMZ, latamoxef (LMOX), gentamicin (GM) and amikacin (AMK) showed good activities against some of the Gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. In conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.
TI  - In vitro activity of clinafloxacin against fluoroquinolone resistant Spanish clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of clinafloxacin against 162 ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates was determined. Isolates were selected when their MIC to ciprofloxacin was 2 mg/l (intermediate) or > 2 mg/l (resistant). The following strains were tested: 61 Escherichia coli, 12 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Proteus mirabilis, 21 Serratia marcescens, 4 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21 Staphylococcus. aureus (resistant to methicillin) and 15 Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin activities were evaluated by agar dilution using Mueller-Hinton agar according to NCCLS recommendations. Of the 162 isolates, 16 (9.8%) were intermediate and 146 (90.1%) resistant to ciprofloxacin. 95 of the 162 strains (58.6%) were susceptible, 27 (16.7%) intermediately susceptible, and 40 strains (24.7%) were resistant to clinafloxacin. The percentage susceptible to clinafloxacin was 65.6% for E. coli, 75% for K. pneumoniae, 71.4% for P. mirabilis, 28.6% for S. marcescens, 75% for E. cloacae, 33.3% for P. aeruginosa, 90.5% for S. aureus and 40% for Enterococcus spp. Clinafloxacin was active against 58.6% of the ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates tested. It was particularly active against S. aureus strains resistant to both ciprofloxacin and methicillin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and five Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. The coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microM. This study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. While coumarins with a methoxy function at C-7 and, if present, an OH group at either the C-6 or C-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (Gram-negative microorganisms including the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus), the presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). A combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1997). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 560 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 9 hospitals during the period of June 1997 to May 1998. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90s of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM and arbekacin (ABK) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. More than a half of S. aureus strains (including MRSA) showed high susceptibilities to gentamicin (GM) and MINO, the MIC50s of 0.25 microgram/ml or 0.5 microgram/ml. 3. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90s of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90s of amikacin (AMK) and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml, the MIC90 of GM was 16 micrograms/ml. Among E. cloacae strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones have decreased in 1997, compared with those in 1996. But the other drugs were not so active in 1997 as 1996. 4. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins were active against E. coli with the MIC90s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. Particularly, flomoxef (FMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP), IPM, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 5. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to almost all the drugs except penicillins. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity with the MICs for all strains equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. FMOX, CPR, CZOP, CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a better state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 6. Proteus mirabilis Almost all the drugs except ABPC and MINO showed high activities against P. mirabilis. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), latamoxef (LMOX), CPR, cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX) and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis. The MICs of them for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. CPFX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 7. Pseudomonas aeruginosa The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/ml, the MIC90s of AMK, IPM and meropenem (MEPM) were 16 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC90s of quinolones had changed into a lower state in 1997, compared with those in 1996. 8. Serratia marcescens IPM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC90s of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. The MIC50s of CRMN was 0.125 microgram/ml or below, the MIC50s of CPR and CZOP were 0.25 microgram/ml.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of acetic acid and Burow's solution as topical otological preparations.
AB  - At present there are no topical otological preparations on the World Health Organisation's essential drug list, largely due to the ototoxic potential of preparations containing aminoglycoside antibiotics. Acetic acid and Burow's solution have long been used in the treatment of the discharging ear. The aim of this study was to ascertain the antibacterial activity of these two preparations against the most commonly occurring bacteria isolated from discharging ears in our department. Twenty fresh isolates of each of the following organisms--Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pyogenes--were plated onto blood agar and tested against one per cent, two per cent and three per cent acetic acid and Burow's solution (13 per cent aluminium acetate). The activity of each agent was ascertained by the size of the zone of inhibition of bacterial growth. Burow's solution showed significantly larger average zones of inhibition than acetic acid (p < 0.001). The two per cent and three per cent acetic acid as well as the Burow's solution were active against all the organisms tested.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of some 2,6-disubstituted 4-anilinoquinazolines.
AB  - Two synthetic 2,6-disubstituted 4-anilinoquinazolines exerted a significant effect on the G+ bacteria Bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. None of 12 tested derivatives influenced Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Derivatives having the aromatic ring non-substituted or substituted by bromine, the pyrimidine ring by phenyl, morpholine or piperidine and the aniline skeleton non-substituted or substituted by methyl or amino group exerted a considerable antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Use of pefloxacin in the treatment of patients with purulent wounds of soft tissues].
AB  - Pefloxacin was used in the treatment of 25 patients with wound infection in a dose of 400 mg orally twice a day for 10-12 days. As the monotherapy it was applied to 15 patients. 7 patients with clinical signs of non-clostridial anaerobic infection were treated with pefloxacin in combination with intravenous metronidazole. Pefloxacin was highly efficient in 96 per cent of the cases with extensive posttraumatic purulent wounds with and without bone affection, acute purulent wounds of the soft tissue, purulent wounds of the soft tissues in diabetic patients, trophic or decubitus ulcer. 266 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter spp. and Acinetobacter spp, were tested and 75 to 100 per cent of them was shown to be susceptible to pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At the same time the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The pathogen eradication and eradication with superinfection in the cases treated with pefloxacin amounted to 92 per cent. The drug tolerance was good. No clinically significant adverse events were recorded.
TI  - The penicillins.
AB  - The penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. In general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. The initial introduction of aqueous penicillin G for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an important pharmacologic landmark. The emergence of penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase ring. Subsequently, the aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and bacampicillin) were developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. Their spectrum initially included Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella, Salmonella, Listeria, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. The search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin and ticarcillin) and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, and piperacillin). Finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid, sulbactam, or tazobactam) and an aminopenicillin, ticarcillin, or piperacillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra by inhibiting certain beta-lactamases (non-group 1) of resistant bacteria. The development of an ideal penicillin that is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, and resistant to beta-lactamases and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of synthetic bismuth compounds against Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for pseudomembranous colitis and many cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Because of potential relapse of disease with current antimicrobial therapy protocols, there is a need for additional and/or alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of disease caused by C. difficile. We have synthesized a systematic series of 14 structurally simple bismuth compounds and assessed their biological activities against C. difficile and four other gastrointestinal species, including Helicobacter pylori. Here, we report on the activities of six compounds that exhibit antibacterial activities against C. difficile, and some of the compounds have MICs of less than 1 microgram/ml. Also tested, for comparison, were the activities of bismuth subcitrate and ranitidine bismuth citrate obtained from commercial sources. C. difficile and H. pylori were more sensitive both to the synthetic bismuth compounds and to the commercial products than were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis, and the last three species were markedly resistant to the commercial bismuth salts. Testing with human foreskin fibroblast cells revealed that some of the synthetic compounds were more cytotoxic than others. Killing curves for C. difficile treated with the more active compounds revealed rapid death, and electron microscopy showed that the bismuth of these compounds was rapidly incorporated by C. difficile. Energy dispersive spectroscopy X-ray microanalysis of C. difficile cells containing electron-dense material confirmed the presence of internalized bismuth. Internalized bismuth was not observed in C. difficile treated with synthetic bismuth compounds that lacked antimicrobial activity, which suggests that the uptake of the metal is required for killing activity. The nature of the carrier would seem to determine whether bismuth is transported into susceptible bacteria like C. difficile.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. METHODS: Cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. In application mode I, patients received on the day before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. In application mode II, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. Just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees C. The HPLC method was used for measuring the concentration. RESULTS: The highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. In this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). These mean concentration are all above the MIC90 of gram-negative bacteria like Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. In some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the MIC90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. Considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The antibacterial effects of tumescent liposuction fluid.
AB  - Tumescent liposuction is currently one of the most commonly performed aesthetic procedures. Despite the variable use of preoperative antibiotics, infection is uncommon. Prior works suggest that the low incidence of infection may be due to lidocaine's antibacterial properties. However, these properties have only been demonstrated using concentrations of lidocaine above 0.8%, significantly higher than those used in tumescent liposuction. The purpose of this study was to determine if the commonly used tumescent fluid containing 0.1% lidocaine, 1:1000,000 epinephrine, and 0.012 mEq sodium bicarbonate possesses antibacterial activity. Using the broth microdilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus were determined after exposure to either lidocaine, epinephrine, bicarbonate, or the combination of all three agents. To determine if there were significant growth differences not detectable by the broth microdilution method, bacterial concentrations were obtained through the use of a spectrophotometer, and significant differences from the controls were calculated by one-way analysis of variance. To determine if prolonged exposure to the tumescent mix would alter bacterial growth, a Killing Time study was also undertaken. The results indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentration of lidocaine was not less than 0.5% for any of the bacteria, whereas the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration of the combined solution was 0.25%. The lowest inhibitory concentration as determined by spectrophotometric analysis for the combined solution was 0.13% (p < 0.01). Analysis of the Killing Time data revealed no inhibition of bacterial growth over time. In conclusion, lidocaine, epinephrine, and bicarbonate do exhibit antibacterial properties at high concentrations. However, the commonly used tumescent mixture containing dilute concentrations of these agents does not significantly inhibit the growth of commonly encountered bacteria.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the urine of children with urinary tract infections from 1986 to 1995].
AB  - In adults and in children urinary system infections are mostly caused by gram-negative and rarely by gram-positive bacteria. Of gram-negative bacteria the most frequent cause of infections are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Serratia etc., and of gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus agalactiae. In rare cases the cause of infection may also be Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to investigate the sensitivity to antibiotics of gram-negative bacteria as the predominant cause of urinary infections. METHOD OF THE STUDY: We isolated 20,615 bacterium species from urine of children hospitalized or treated as outpatients at the University Children's Hospital in Belgrade. Urine was collected classically, i.e. by taking the second clean stream into a sterile test tube or by Uricult test. The samples were cultured on blood plates and endo-agar. Identification was done by standard bacteriologic methods and when findings were dubious API-20E (bioMerieux) was used. Bacterium sensitivity to nine antibiotics (ampicillin, cephalexin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, amikacin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin) was assessed with disc diffuse method on Muller-Hinton agars. RESULTS: Based on the obtained results, Escherichia coli species sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin ranged from 90 to 100%; sensitivity to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol ranged from 70 to 80%, to cephalexin from 50 to 60%, while to ampicillin it was only 20%. Klebsiella species sensitivity to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime was 70-85%; to amikacin, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin 60-80%; to cephalexin and chloramphenicol 40-50%, and to ampicillin only 5-15%. Proteus species showed sensitivity to amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and nalidixic acid of 90-95%; to co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol 70-80%; to cephalexin and ampicillin 40-50%, and to nitrofurantoin 10%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa species showed the highest level of sensitivity to amikacin (40-50%), and somewhat lower to gentamicin (10-40%), and a very low sensitivity to other antimicrobial drugs (10-25%). DISCUSSION: It may be noted from the above data that gram-negative bacteria are the cause of urinary infections in about 90% of cases, while gram-positive bacteria are the cause in only 10%, which is in accordance with data from literature. Of all antibiotic drugs ampicillin (a wide spectrum penicillin) had a very significant role in the therapy of urinary infections. However, the long-term usage of ampicillin led to increased resistance to the drug in infections caused by Escherichia coli. Natural resistance to ampicillin of Klebsiella species limited its usage when penicillin was first introduced. Proteus mirabilis species, especially those isolate in primary infection, are often sensitive to amino penicillin. Contrary to Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus and Providentie species show a high resistance to these antibiotics. Due to the crisis in our country and the lack of other antibiotics, ampicillin was widely used. The wide use of the drug caused evident resistance of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis to this antibiotic. A fall in the sensitivity of Klebsiella to cephalexin, gentamicin, amikacin and co-timoxazole, which occurred in 1992, has been explained by intrahospital circulation of multiresistant Klebsiella species. The sensitivity of isolated gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prominent to aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin). The most frequent mechanism of enterobacterial resistance to trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole involves dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Comparative studies related to the administration of co-trimoxazole have shown that the difference in the efficacy between thes
TI  - A microbiological study of anterior nasal packs in epistaxis.
AB  - Bleeding per nose is one of the comnonest ailment encountered by each and every otolaryngologvst Since hemostasis is immediate concern, anterior nasal pressure pack is put and is usually allowed to remain for 24-72 hours. Blood soaked pack and raw mucosal surface are good media for bacterial multiplication resulting in infection including sinusitis and sometimes toxic shock syndromes.Present study is conducted to work out bacterial flora of anterior nasal pack and effect of svstemic antibiotics in controlling it. Thirty cases of epistaxis of different etiology were included. Out of these 26 cases were positive on culture. These included Staphylococcus aureus 70%,. Pseudomonas aeruginosa twenty three percent. Klabsiella pneumonia and proteus mirabilis 3.3%, Streptococcus and Hemolyticus 3.3%. Details of type and duration of packing and its relation with organism cultured are discussed. It is concluded that the packing material should be soaked with antibiotics prior to use and should not be keep for more than 48 hours. And systemic antibiotics does not have any significant on this local infection due to packing.
TI  - Complicated urinary tract infection: analysis of 179 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to investigate the incidence, bacteriology,  management and outcome of complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) at the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei. METHODS: Between June, 1993, and July, 1994, medical records of 2,566 patients admitted to the Division of Urology, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, were retrospectively reviewed. Of these patient, 1,322 had a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 607 were admitted for renal stones, 496 for ureteral stones, 75 for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder, 47 for renal tumors and 19 for TCC of the ureter. Among all patients studied, 179 (6.98%) acquired a complicated UTI. Of these, 81 were admitted for BPH, 46 for renal stones, 42 for ureteral stones, five for TCC of the urinary bladder, three for renal tumors and two for TCC of the ureter. RESULTS: Of the 179 patients with complicated UTIs, 155 were men and 24 were women. The urine culture positive rate was 76.0% (136/179) and the most common bacteria were Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The principle mode of treatment included parenteral antibiotics and urinary diversion (percutaneous nephrostomy and Foley catheterization), when necessary. The infection control rate for these complicated UTIs was 96.3% for BPH, 95.5% for renal stone, 97.6% for ureteral stone, 80% for TCC of the urinary bladder, 100% for renal tumor and 100% for TCC of the ureter. Mortality due to complicated UTI was 3.9% (7/179). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the prognosis of complicated UTI is good if diagnosis and appropriate treatment are given promptly. Early drainage to relieve obstruction and intravenous antibiotics are initially necessary. Surgical intervention is required to resolve functional or structural abnormalities after the UTI has been controlled.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro susceptibility of hospital bacterial isolates to piperacillin and tazocin (piperacillin/tazobactam].
AB  - Due to increasing frequency of infections caused by pathogens that are resistant  to beta-lactam antibiotics, combinations of such antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors were introduced into therapy in last few years. Tazobactam is the most potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. The purpose of the study was to evaluate in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin and piperacillin with tazobactam of 256 isolates cultured from biological samples obtained from 203 patients. The biological materials obtained were as follows: urine (44.9%), post-operative and post-traumatic wound swabs (27.3%), BAL (12.1%), blood (6.6%), drain swabs and other (5.5%). The isolates predominantly found were Escherichia coli (22.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.0%), Staphylococcus aureus MSSA (13.7%), Proteus mirabilis (11.7%) and other. There were 95.5% of strains found susceptible to piperacillin with tazobactam and only 4.3% resistant ones. On the other hand, piperacillin only susceptible strains were 59.4% and resistant ones in 40.6%. Great differences in susceptibility to examined antimicrobial agents were observed in Enterobacteriaceae family and Staphylococcus (MSS) genus. There were no differences in susceptibility to piperacillin and tazobactam and piperacillin alone in anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae strains and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Studies on the formation of crystalline bacterial biofilms on urethral catheters.
AB  - A model of the catheterised bladder was used to test the ability of urease-producing urinary tract pathogens to encrust urethral catheters. Encrustation was assessed by determining the amounts of calcium and magnesium deposited on the catheters and visualised by scanning electron microscopy. Urease-positive Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa failed to raise the urinary pH and form crystalline biofilms. In contrast, strains of Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Providencia rettgeri generated alkaline urine (pH 8.3-8.6) and extensive catheter encrustation within 24 h.
TI  - [A national multicenter study of the in-vitro activity of piperacillin-tazobactam. The Spanish Piperacillin-Tazobactam Group].
AB  - The action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a Spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. The samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13% respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. The gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: Escherichia (1,289), Pseudomonas (451), Proteus (230), Klebsiella (203), Haemophilus (172), Enterobacter (145), Acinetobacter (88), Salmonella (60), Bacteroides (57), Morganella (53), Serratia (46), Citrobacter (46), Stenotrophonomas (23) and Moraxella (21). The gram-positive bacteria were S. aureus (316), E. faecalis (239), S. epidermis (130), S. pneumoniae (115) and Clostridium spp. (12). The global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: E. coli 98%, P. aeruginosa 92%, and P. mirabilis, Morganella, K. pneumoniae, Serratia and Salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. The susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% Citrobacter, 77% E. cloacae, 42% A. baumannii, 61% S. maltophilia, 97% E. faecalis, 93% S. epidermidis, 100% M. catarrhalis, 99% H. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria. The action on S. pneumoniae and S. aureus varied according to the susceptibility or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. In comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.
TI  - Airways microbial flora in COPD patients in stable clinical conditions and during exacerbations: a bronchoscopic investigation.
AB  - Patients affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergo frequent exacerbations of their illness characterized by increased cough and expectoration. The precise aetiology of these episodes often remains unknown. In the absence of clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia, bacterial or viral cultures of sputum usually provide little useful information. Thus, we performed fibreoptic bronchoscopy using a protected specimen brush (PSB) to obtain uncontaminated secretions for culture from 56 patients with COPD, 16 with stable clinical conditions and 40 affected with exacerbations of the disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate bronchial microbial flora by quantitative aerobic and anaerobic culture of each specimen. Twenty five subjects (45%), 4 (16%) in stable state and 21 (84%) with COPD exacerbations, had specimens which gave rise to significant bacterial growth (> 10(3) colony forming units.mL-1). The predominant bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (in 10 cases) and alpha-haemolytic streptococci (in 6 cases); other bacteria found were coagulase-negative staphylococci and Branhamella catarralis in (2 cases each), and Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aerococcus viridans and Chromobacterium violaceum (each in a single case only). Although significant bacterial growth was more frequently found in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations and in those with a higher degree of bronchial inflammation, the differences between the two groups of patients were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the results obtained in our study confirm the validity of and the need for reliable sampling methods (like the protected specimen brush) to demonstrate significant bacterial colonization of the airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - The prognostic factors of adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis.
AB  - Seventy-seven patients with Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM), 57 males and 20 females, aged 17-86 years, were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, over an 11-year period. Fifty-four infections were community-acquired, and 23 were nosocomial; 49 were spontaneous and 28 occurred after head surgery or neurosurgery. The organisms most frequently involved were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter. Rarer pathogens included Citrobacter species, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis. All patients who did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy died. The mortality in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 28%. Other statistically significant prognostic factors included septic shock, initial level of consciousness, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma, disseminated intravascular coagulation, high cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels and leucocytosis. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only appropriate antimicrobial therapy and septic shock were strongly associated with mortality even after adjusting for other potentially confounding factors. Despite the high mortality, management can be improved by early diagnosis, early use of appropriate antibiotics, and correction of underlying and associated medical derangement.
TI  - Antibodies to urinary tract pathogens in patients with spinal cord lesions.
AB  - Chronic or recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is a significant problem or patients with spinal cord lesions (SCL). UTIs are thought to be a major factor in the development of reduced renal function. To investigate the pathogenesis 151 patients with SCL were included in this study during a 7 year period. Results of intravenous pyelography and isotope renography were recorded as well as the bladder emptying methods. One to seven blood samples were obtained from each patient and tested for plasma creatinine, and the presence of precipitating antibodies against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella ozaenae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found significant correlation between duration of SCL and precipitating antibodies against urinary tract pathogens (PAU) (r = 0.23, P < 0.005), between plasma creatinine and PAU in patients with spina bifida (r = 0.64, P < 0.01), between PAU and the number of positive urine cultures (r = 0.17; P < 0.05) and a relation between abnormal urological findings and PAU. In addition, the PAU was significantly higher in patients with indwelling urethral catheters (P < 0.001). Thus it seems that PAU can be of prognostic value in SCL patients, and PAU might be an indicator for intensified treatment of recurrent UTI.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  - Of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by Escherichia coli (E Coli), followed by Proteus mirabilis (P mirabilis), Klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. Of E coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-R), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AMC). For P mirabilis, ampi-R isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to AMC. Klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to AMC. In these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. In the other enterobacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, P vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and AMC) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of P vulgaris to AMC. Enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and P aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. For Staphylococcus aureus, the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. All the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - Carbapenem-induced endotoxin release in gram-negative bacterial sepsis rat models.
AB  - The carbapenem-induced endotoxin release was evaluated using experimental models  of gram-negative bacterial sepsis in Wistar rats. Infections with Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis resulted in an increase of the plasma endotoxin concentration after treatment with ceftazidime and carbapenems including imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem. Except for P. aeruginosa, the plasma endotoxin concentrations after carbapenem treatment were significantly lower than those after ceftazidime treatment. It is noteworthy that treatment of P. aeruginosa sepsis with meropenem or biapenem induced significantly more endotoxin release than other carbapenems and the endotoxin concentrations induced by these carbapenems reached those of ceftazidime treatment. The plasma endotoxin concentrations appeared to correlate with the reduction of platelet counts and the elevation of both glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase values.
TI  - Clinical trial of ototopical ofloxacin for treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - A multicenter, open-label prospective trial was performed to determine the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of ofloxacin (OFLX) otic solution in the treatment of subjects > or =12 years with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) and a chronically perforated tympanic membrane in the infected ear(s). A total of 207 patients at 27 centers in the United States and Central America received OFLX 0.5 mL instilled ototopically twice daily for 14 consecutive days. The primary clinical end point was cure (dry ear) or failure (not dry ear). The primary microbiologic end point was eradication of baseline pathogens. Because there was no comparator and there were few data in the literature regarding clinical efficacy in patients treated with other regimens, the efficacy of OFLX was compared with data recorded in the clinical records of historical-practice control (HPC) or current-practice control (CPC) subjects. The incidence of clinical cure in clinically evaluable OFLX-treated patients (91%; 148 of 162 subjects) was significantly higher than in HPC subjects (67%; 124 of 185 subjects) or CPC subjects (70%; 38 of 54 subjects). OFLX eradicated all baseline pathogens isolated in microbiologically evaluable subjects. These pathogens were predominantly Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. The most common treatment-related adverse event, bitter taste, occurred in 17% (35 of 207) of OFLX-treated subjects. Thus OFLX 0.5 mL administered twice daily for 14 days was effective in resolving the signs and symptoms of CSOM in subjects > or =12 years, was significantly more effective than therapies used to treat HPC or CPC subjects, and was well tolerated.
TI  - Activities of LL-37, a cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide of human neutrophils.
AB  - Human neutrophils contain two structurally distinct types of antimicrobial peptides, beta-sheet defensins (HNP-1 to HNP-4) and the alpha-helical peptide LL-37. We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Further studies of transferable antibiotic resistance in strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from four clinical settings in three countries.
AB  - This paper describes transferability of antibiotic resistance determinants in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to imipenem, cefotaxime and ceftazidime obtained from different clinical settings in three different countries. Two strains of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli K-12 and Proteus mirabilis P-38) and two strains of P. aeruginosa (PAO and ML) were used as recipient strains. The conjugative transfer of resistance was very specific, i.e. donor strains of P. aeruginosa transferred individual resistance determinants either to recipient strains E. coli K-12 and P. mirabilis P-38, or to P. aeruginosa PAO or ML. In a case when three different species (P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were isolated from a single patient, a block of resistance determinants was transferred both to Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa recipients. A single plasmid with rather specific properties was suspected of being exchanged among strains of these different species. It was recommended to study the overall situation of transferability of individual resistance determinants in bacterial strains belonging to various species of nosocomial bacteria, especially of P. aeruginosa, by using a rather specific methodology.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to self-reinforced polyglycolic acid and self-reinforced polylactic acid 96 urological spiral stents in vitro.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacterial adherence to biodegradable self-reinforced polyglycolic acid (SR-PGA) and self-reinforced poly-DL-lactic acid (SR-PLA 96) spiral stents in vitro. They are used as temporary urethral stents in urology. Gold-plated metal wire, polyurethane and latex were used as controls. Materials were incubated up to 28 days in artificial urine, after which a bacterial suspension was added. After detaching by sonication the adhesive bacteria were analysed as colony forming units (CFUs) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Adhesion was more significantly correlated to stent bacterial type than to the tested material in both assays. No encrustation was seen on SR-PGA or SR-PLA 96. SR-PGA and SR-PLA 96 had no effect on the bacterial growth. In conclusion, the bacterial properties are equally or more important than the material properties in the adhesion process.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - Microbiologic evaluation of cutaneous wounds in hospitalized dermatology patients.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify predictability of wound flora which may  be helpful in the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy of wound infections while awaiting the results of bacterial cultures. Toward this end, results of an ongoing microbiologic surveillance of skin wound flora in hospitalized dermatology patients are presented. Bacterial isolates cultured from patients with skin wounds admitted to a tertiary care dermatology inpatient unit were evaluated and comparison was made to a previous survey of the same inpatient service done in 1992. Microbiologic evaluation of superficial skin wounds, leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers showed that Staphylococcus aureus was the principal isolate in superficial wounds (77%) compared to the equal prevalence of S. aureus (43%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (42%) cultured from leg ulcers. Cultures from pressure ulcers grew Proteus mirabilis as the dominant isolate. These data agree with previous surveillance data from the same inpatient base performed in 1992 and support the relatively predictable wound flora cultured from skin wounds in our hospital inpatient unit over the 4 years surveillance period. This predictability can enhance empiric antibiotic selection for wound infections while awaiting the results of bacterial culture, and supports the value of local microbiologic surveillance programs in the management of wound infections.
TI  - Urinary bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin versus norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  - In an open, randomised monocentric crossover study in six male and six female healthy volunteers, the urinary antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of enoxacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were assessed. Urine was collected up to 6 days, and venous blood samples up to 12 h, after a single oral dose of 400 mg enoxacin, 400 mg norfloxacin and 500 mg ciprofloxacin. Enoxacin (250 mg/l) demonstrated the highest peak concentration (median) in the urine (0-6 h), followed by ciprofloxacin (237 mg/l) and norfloxacin (157 mg/l) as determined by the HPLC assay. The total amount (mean) excreted by the kidneys as parent drugs were as follows: enoxacin 54% of dose, ciprofloxacin 33% of dose, and norfloxacin 22% of dose. The mean plasma concentrations decreased from 1 to 4 h after administration for enoxacin from 1.9 to 1.4 mg/l, for ciprofloxacin from 2.0 to 0.8 mg/l and for norfloxacin from 1.3 to 0.5 mg/l. The antibacterial activity in urine was determined as urinary bactericidal titers (UBT), i.e. the highest 2-fold dilution of urine still bactericidal for the reference organism (E. coli ATCC 25,922) and for five uropathogens with minimal inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentrations ranging from highly susceptible to resistant cultured from the urine of patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI). For the E. coli ATCC 25,922, the organism with the lowest MIC, median UBTs of ciprofloxacin were present for 4 days, decreasing from 1:512 to 1:2, that of enoxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:256 to 1:4, and that of norfloxacin for 2 days, decreasing from 1:128 to 1:2. For the five uropathogens (with increasing MICs: K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. coli (resistant to nalidixic acid), P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis), the UBTs decreased in general, according to MICs, demonstrating the same relations of UBTs for ciprofloxacin (highest) versus enoxacin (medium) versus norfloxacin (lowest) with one exception (P. mirabilis) for which norfloxacin showed higher UBTs than enoxacin. The minimal urinary bactericidal concentrations (MUBC), as derived from urinary concentrations, and UBTs showed a fairly wide inter- and intraindividual range and were generally higher than the corresponding MBCs as determined in Mueller Hinton broth. In conclusion, according to antibacterial activity in urine determined as UBTs, a single oral dose of ciprofloxacin (500 mg) generally resulted in the highest and longest-lasting UBTs followed by that of enoxacin (400 mg) and norfloxacin (400 mg). A dose of 400 mg enoxacin can be expected to be at least equivalent if not superior to that of 400 mg norfloxacin. Only enoxacin and ciprofloxacin exhibited urinary bactericidal activity against all test organisms up to 12 h in all individuals. Therefore, clinical comparison of enoxacin versus ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated UTI could be worth testing.
TI  - [Therapeutic effect of cefluprenam on polymicrobial urinary tract infection associated with Enterococcus faecalis, using the infectious urolithiasis model in rats].
AB  - We examined the therapeutic effect of cefluprenam (CFLP) on the polymicrobial urinary tract infection associated with infectious stones as compared to that of ceftazidime (CAZ), using the experimental polymicrobial urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis). In order to form bladder stones in rats, a sterile zinc ring was implanted as a foreign body, followed by inoculating P. mirabilis E05106 transurethrelly. Thereafter, P. aeruginosa E030033 and E. faecalis 966 were inoculated according to the same way. CFLP or CAZ was administered intravenously twice a day for 5 days. The therapeutic effect was evaluated by the eradication of these bacteria from the urine, the kidney and stones, inhibition of growth of stones, and also a value of BUN. The urinary excretion rates of CFLP and CAZ was also determined (20 mg/kg). In result, CFLP significantly more effective in the eradication of P. mirabilitis, P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis from the urine, the kidney and stones than the control than the control (p < 0.05). Furthermore, CFLP significantly more effective in the eradication of P. aeruginosa from the urine and also E. facalis from the urine and stones (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, CAZ significantly more effective in the eradication of P. mirabilis from the urine, the kidney and stones and also P. aeraginosa from the kidney and stones than the control. However, CAZ did not show eradicative effect on E. faecalis. The urinary excretion rates of CFLP and CAZ at rats were 59.3% and 59.4%, respectively, within 8 hrs after administration, showing a similar excretion pattern. CFLP exhibited the prominent therapeutic effect on polymicrobial urinary tract infection associated with infectious stones caused by P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa and E. faecalls. On the basis of these results, it has been strongly suggested that CFLP is highly beneficial in the management of intractable polymicrobial urinary tract infectious in clinic.
TI  - Imipenem resistance in aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A prospective study was undertaken to observe the emergence of resistance to imipenem, if any, among aerobic gram-negative bacteria. A total of 736 isolates were tested during 1994-95 and less than 1% of them were resistant to imipenem, whereas the next year ('95-'96) the rate increased to 11 of the 903 isolates tested. The resistant isolates during '94-'95 were all Stenotrophomonas maltophilia whereas the spectrum of resistant bacterial species increased in '95-'96 to include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii with a tendency to an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the later part of the year. A majority (72%) of the resistant isolates were from patients with burns, and burn wounds were most frequently infected with such organisms. These data suggest that over a period of time aerobic gram-negative bacteria may develop resistance to imipenem and the pool of such bacteria increases with extensive use of the drug. Non-fermentative aerobic bacteria tend to develop resistance faster with widespread dissemination than Enterobacteriaceae. Hospital Burn Units are a potential source of development of such resistance.
TI  - An in-vitro study of carbapenem-induced morphological changes and endotoxin release in clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - One hundred clinical isolates, including Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis, were exposed to carbapenems (imipenem, panipenem, meropenem and biapenem) at 0.5 x MIC for 3 h, then their morphology was examined and endotoxin release determined. Ceftazidime, which induces filament formation, was used as a control. Scanning electron microscopy showed that these carbapenems induced formation of spherical or ovoid cells, except for P. aeruginosa treated with meropenem and biapenem; these latter cells had a 'bulge' midway along them and we have termed them 'oval-centred'. There was a relationship between morphology and the amount of endotoxin released following exposure to carbapenems or ceftazidime. Of all the species investigated, P. aeruginosa showed the most variable morphological changes. P. aeruginosa exposed to biapenem were longer oval-centred in shape, and released significantly more endotoxin than those exposed to imipenem, panipenem (spherical) or meropenem (shorter oval-centred cells) (P=0.030, 0.017 and 0.002, respectively). In all strains except P. aeruginosa, carbapenems induced significantly less endotoxin release than ceftazidime (P < 0.05).
TI  - Evaluation of use of a new chromogenic agar in detection of urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - CHROMagar Orientation, a new chromogenic medium, was evaluated for the detection  and differentiation of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic microorganisms in 900 urine samples from hospitalized patients. Performance characteristics of the medium were evaluated in comparison to those of 5% sheep blood and MacConkey agars by direct inoculation of the urine samples on the three media. Four gram-negative and two gram-positive strains as well as one yeast control strain from the American Type Culture Collection were used to ensure quality control. CHROMagar Orientation succeeded in detecting all the urine pathogens that were detected by the reference media, including gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci, streptococci, and yeasts. Colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation accurately differentiated Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. Owing to the similarity in the pigmentation produced by Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter isolates, the medium failed to distinguish among them; however, these isolates were easily recognized as coliforms because of their metallic blue coloration. Staphylococci were clearly perceptible: S. aureus and S. epidermidis grow in regular-size colonies that range from opaque white to yellowish, and S. saprophyticus produces opaque pink colonies. All streptococcus strains, including those from groups B and C, were detected. They grow as undifferentiated flat dry diffused colonies, and additional tests were required for identification. Enterococci were easily discriminated by their strong turquoise pigmentation and their typical growth on the agar's surface. Yeast grow in typical creamy wet convex colonies. The accuracy of antibiotic susceptibility determinations according to standard methods was also tested by picking isolates directly from CHROMagar Orientation. The results showed excellent correlation with those obtained with microorganisms picked from reference media. Owing to the ease in differentiating mixed flora on CHROMagar Orientation, antimicrobic susceptibility tests were performed directly from primary isolates in all cases without the need for subcultures.
TI  - [Risk factors and pathogenic microorganisms in patients with insufficient esophagojejunostomy after gastrectomy].
AB  - It was the aim of the study to find by retrospective analysis of data from totally gastrectomized patients risk factors for the development of esophago-jejunal anastomotic leakage, that may be avoidable or influenced therapeutically. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study design was retrospective involving 838 patients with total gastrectomy for gastric cancer from the years 1973-1993. In 134 cases leakage of the esophago-jejunostomy occurred. The relative risk for the development of leakage associated with individual parameters was determined by comparing the data from 704 patients without leakage to the data from 134 patients presenting with this complication. For a subgroup of 86 patients with anastomotic leakage microbiological data of swabs taken from the anastomoses were available, which were evaluated with respect to potentially pathogenic bacilli. RESULTS: The overall leakage rate of esophago-jejunal anastomoses was 15.9% (n = 134). The mortality rate during this time period amounted to 14.3%. Leakage was a most highly significant factor for mortality (p = 0.0001). Significant risk factors for leakage of the esophago-jejunostomy were tumors of the cardia, splenectomy, a duration of operating time of more than 5 hours and manual suture technique compared to stapler anastomoses. Tumor unrelated associated disease, tumor stage and a history of other preexisting gastric diseases were not associated with an increased relative risk. At the time of the initial clinical manifestation of leakage the following pathogenic bacilli could be isolated from leaking anastomoses with decreasing incidence: E. coli, S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae a.o. The bacterial spectrum has not changed during the observation period of 20 years. SUMMARY: With the exception of the choice of suture techniques the identified clinical risk factors cannot be avoided or influenced therapeutically due to a lack of potentially curative treatment alternatives. In contrast potentially pathogenic bacilli associated with leakage can be prevented from coming in contact with anastomoses thereby preventing infection and leakage.
TI  - Effect of adherence on antimicrobial susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - A simple method was used for testing the antibiotic susceptibility of adherent bacteria to plastic surfaces. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis cells adhering to the bottom of a plastic tissue culture plate were incubated in serially diluted antibiotic solutions. After 24-h incubation the solutions were removed and a fresh medium without antibiotics was added to each well. The viability of the cells was judged by their growth after a further 24-h incubation. In our assay system, we employed a short incubation time (1-h) involving adherence of bacteria to a surface for the purpose of minimizing the effect of the glycocalyx on antibiotic activity. Even if the bacteria did not form a biofilm, the minimal bactericidal concentrations for adherent bacteria (MBCADs) markedly elevated. The MBCADs of ofloxacin well correlated with the bacteriological eradication by ofloxacin treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with indwelling urinary catheters, whereas the minimal inhibitory concentrations did not show a correlation. Kinetic studies showed that adherent Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a 2 h-lag time before logarithmically growing when these bacteria were incubated in Mueller-Hinton broth without antibiotics. The tolerance demonstrated by adherent cells is likely to play a role in the difficulties encountered in the antimicrobial chemotherapy of biofilm infections. Moreover, our assay system was considered to be useful in the therapeutic selection of antibiotics for these infections.
TI  - Regulatory conservation and divergence of sigma32 homologs from gram-negative bacteria: Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
AB  - The heat shock response in Escherichia coli is mediated primarily by the rpoH gene, encoding sigma32, which is specifically required for transcription of heat shock genes. A number of sigma32 homologs have recently been cloned from gram-negative bacteria that belong to the gamma or alpha subdivisions of the proteobacteria. We report here some of the regulatory features of several such homologs (RpoH) expressed in E. coli as well as in respective cognate bacteria. When expressed in an E. coli delta rpoH strain lacking its own sigma32, these homologs activated the transcription of heat shock genes (groE and dnaK) from the start sites normally used in E. coli. The level of RpoH in Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells was very low at 30 degrees C but was elevated markedly upon a shift to 42 degrees C, as found previously with E. coli. The increased RpoH levels upon heat shock resulted from both increased synthesis and stabilization of the normally unstable RpoH protein. In contrast, the RpoH level in Proteus mirabilis was relatively high at 30 degrees C and increased less markedly upon heat shock, mostly by increased synthesis; this sigma32 homolog was already stable at 30 degrees C, and little further stabilization occurred upon the shift to 42 degrees C. The increased synthesis of RpoH homologs in all these gamma proteobacteria was observed even in the presence of rifampin, suggesting that the induction occurred at the level of translation. Thus, the basic regulatory strategy of the heat shock response by enhancing the RpoH level is well conserved in the gamma proteobacteria, but some divergence in the actual mechanisms used occurred during evolution.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the elderly.
AB  - The aims of the study were to describe community-acquired and nosocomial bacteraemia in elderly patients and to determine the factors associated with increased mortality in these patients attending a tertiary hospital in Singapore. A consecutive series of 191 patients aged more than 60 years of age admitted in 1995 was studied retrospectively. All of them had positive blood culture results obtained from the Department of Pathology and the case notes were reviewed and entered into a standard clinical protocol. They were analysed for age, sex, place of origin, race, sites of infection, clinical parameters and bacteriology. The mean age of the study population was 75 years (SD = 8.9 years). Bacteraemia was acquired from the community in 57.5% of patients, 33% was nosocomial in origin and 9.5% acquired it in chronic long term care facilities. The common organisms cultured in community-acquired infections were Escherichia coli (26.1%), Klebsiella species (25.4%), Streptococcus species (11.1%), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (7.6%) and Proteus mirabilis (4.8%). The common organisms cultured in nosocomial infections were Klebsiella species (19.8%), Enterobacter species (14.6%), E. coli (11.8%), Acinetobacter baumanii (9.2%), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (7.9%). Whilst most cases of bacteraemia were single organism cultures, 13.5% were polymicrobial. The common sources of bacteraemia were chest (27.5%), urinary tract (24.5%), skin (12.5), hepatic (8.8%), gut (4.3%), cardiovascular system (1%) and others (3.6%). In 12.5% of cases, the sources were multiple and in 5.3% of cases, the source could not be identified. Twenty-one per cent of patients with bacteraemia died. The following factors were associated with increased mortality rate: older age (median age of those that died was 78.5 years compared to survivors with a median age of 73 years, P = 0.011), patient's place of origin (patients in nursing home at higher risk of death, P = 0.04), patient's mobility status (immobile patients at higher risk, P = 0.00297), source of bacteraemia--respiratory infection at increased risk of death (P = 0.00009) but urinary tract infection had a better survival rate (P = 0.03935) and multiple sites of infection (patients with multiple sites of infection had higher risk, P = 0.00897). Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia was associated with a mortality rate of 35.3%, followed by Klebsiella species 28.6%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 28.6%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 25%, Proteus mirabilis 25% and E. coli 19.1%. Important clinical parameters which indicated a poor clinical outcome were: high pulse rate, hypotension, increased respiratory rate, low total white cell count, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminaemia and increased creatinine level.
TI  - [Urinary bacteria in elderly patients with urinary incontinence and low levels of daily activity].
AB  - The results of bacteria isolated from the urine of inactive elderly patients with urinary incontinence in 1982, 87, 93 and 95 were compared and the chronological changes of urinary bacteria were analyzed. The following results were obtained: (1) The most common bacteria isolated from the patients in 1995 were D-group Enterococcus, followed by Providencia rettgeri, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. It is thought that the main cause of the more frequent isolation of Enterococcus is an abuse of cephems and fecal contamination. (2) The most common bacteriaisolated from the patients who were managed with an indwelling urethral catheter were Proteus and Providencia species, and their incidence tended to decrease from 1982 to 1995. (3) Infection with Pseudomonas species tended to increase, as did that Staphylococcus species, especially Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and then decreased. Based on these findings, it is important to assess and treat dysuria before inserting an indwelling urethral catheter, and to select an antibacterial agent that is effective in elderly patients with urinary incontinence and limited activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of fosfomycin trometamol against pathogens from urinary tract infections: a Spanish multicenter study.
AB  - The in-vitro susceptibilities of a total of 1371 urinary tract pathogens to fosfomycin trometamol were determined. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, Enterobacteriaceae and gram-positive microorganisms were, in general, very sensitive to this antimicrobial. More than 90.0% of the Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. and more than 70.0% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus spp. strains tested were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. strains were more resistant. In general, recent clinical isolates from urinary tract infections (UTIs) in both community and hospital were also very sensitive (> 80.0%) to fosfomycin, its activity being higher than that of the rest of the antimicrobials commonly used for therapy of uncomplicated UTIs. More than 75.0% of the most frequently isolated pathogens from UTIs, except for P. aeruginosa (31.8%) and Acinetobacter spp. (11.1%), were susceptible to fosfomycin trometamol. The results obtained in this study, together with the infrequency of side effects and its pharmacokinetic properties, indicate that fosfomycin trometamol may be a useful alternative for single-dose therapy of uncomplicated UTIs.
TI  - The role of fluoroquinolones in respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Quinolones, because of their excellent pharmacokinetic properties, high antimicrobial activity and low incidence of side-effects, have been broadly accepted for the treatment of many infections. Because of perceived limitations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus there has been some reluctance to use them for respiratory tract infections. Ciprofloxacin is the drug of choice for malignant external otitis, a disease caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it has also been used successfully for the treatment of chronic otitis media where P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and Proteus mirabilis are main pathogens. Quinolones are as efficacious as the beta-lactams and cephalosporins in the treatment of acute sinusitis but most clinicians will not use quinolones for this indication. Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis respond to antimicrobial therapy and quinolones have been demonstrated to be at least equivalent to second- and third-generation cephalosporins, co-amoxiclav and beta-lactams. Recently published guidelines in Canada, USA and Great Britain do not recommend quinolones for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia except for patients with life-threatening disease requiring ICU admission. A quinolone in combination with an aminoglycoside and macrolide is a regimen that can be used as initial empirical therapy until the results of microbiological investigations are available. For patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia, where multiply resistant aerobic Gram-negative bacilli are a consideration, a quinolone in combination with an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin has been recommended. In the absence of P. aeruginosa, monotherapy with a quinolone is at least as effective as third-generation cephalosporins or imipenem. Early switch therapy from parenteral antibiotics to oral fluoroquinolone has been demonstrated to be very successful.
TI  - Changing trends in frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens in outpatient clinics and a hospital in Southern Israel, 1991-1995.
AB  - In order to monitor changes in the frequency and antimicrobial resistance of urinary pathogens over several years, urinary cultures received from outpatient clinics and from a hospital during a period of one month each in 1991 and 1995 were analyzed at a clinical microbiology laboratory. In 1991 and 1995, 1366 and 1534 significant monomicrobic cultures respectively were reviewed. The frequency of Escherichia coli dropped significantly in the outpatient clinics from 70.5% to 61.2% (p < 0.0001). The frequency of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria also decreased, but the frequency of Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. increased from 2.6% to 5.8% (p < 0.0001). In the hospital, the frequency of Enterobacter spp. (p < 0.04), Escherichia coli and Morganella morganii declined from 1991 to 1995, whereas the frequency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.001), Acinetobacter spp. (p < 0.05), Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis and other gram-negative rods increased considerably. The frequency of gram-positive aerobic bacteria rose markedly in outpatient specimens from 6.1% to 13.5% (p < 0.0001), while a decline from 14.4% to 9.3% was noted in hospital specimens (p < 0.02). A significant rise in the resistance of Escherichia coli to gentamicin and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) was detected in outpatient isolates. In the hospital, gram-negative urinary pathogens demonstrated increased resistance to ampicillin (p = 0.042), cefuroxime (p = 0.005), gentamicin (p = 0.002) and ciprofloxacin (p < 0.0001) during the study period. The changing etiology of urinary tract infections and the increasing resistance of organisms indicate that periodic monitoring and possibly also modification of empirical therapy are required.
TI  - Isolation, purification, and characterization of the major autolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The major (26 kDa) autolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of preparative electrophoresis, ion-exchange, and dye-ligand chromatographies. This purification was facilitated by the development of a spot-assay that involved the spotting and subsequent incubation of autolysin samples on polyacrylamide gels containing peptidoglycan. The pl of the 26-kDa autolysin was determined to be between 3.5 and 4 and disulfide bonds within the enzyme were essential for activity. The autolysin catalyzed the release of reducing sugars from the peptidoglycans of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli indicating it to be a beta-glycosidase. It was ineffective at hydrolysing the peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria and the O-acetylated peptidoglycans from either Proteus mirabilis or Staphylococcus aureus. The N-terminal sequence of the purified autolysin was determined to be His-Glu-Pro-Pro-Gly. The 26-kDa autolysin together with a 29-kDa autolysin was determined to be secreted into the medium by a mechanism that involves the production and release of surface membrane vesicles during normal growth, but the enzymes were not found free and active in culture broth supernatants.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts and constituents of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, (+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled Pelargonium species.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Ofloxacin otic solution for treatment of otitis externa in children and adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution with those of Cortisporin otic solutions (neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate, and hydrocortisone) in otitis externa in adults and children. DESIGN: Two randomized, evaluator-blind, multicenter trials, 1 each in children and adults. SETTING: Twenty-three primary care and referral ambulatory care sites per trial. PATIENTS: A total of 314 adults (12 years and older) and 287 children (younger than 12 years). Of the total, data for 247 adults and 227 children were considered clinically evaluable (CE), and those for 98 children and 98 adults were microbiologically evaluable (ME). INTERVENTIONS: Ofloxacin (adults, 0.5 mL; children, 0.25 mL) twice daily or Cortisporin (adults, 0.2 mL; children, 0.15 mL) 4 times daily for 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CE subjects were cured if all signs and symptoms resolved at posttherapy (days 11-13) and test-of-cure (days 17-20) visits. The ME subjects had microbiological and clinical successes if they were cured and had microbiological eradication or presumed eradication. RESULTS: Cure was observed in 82% and 97% of CE adults and children treated with ofloxacin and 84% and 95% of CE adults and children treated with Cortisporin, respectively. The most common pathogens at the pretherapy visit were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric bacilli. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical or microbiological and clinical cure or in the rates of adverse events between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ofloxacin given twice daily is as safe and effective as Cortisporin given 4 times daily for otitis externa. The bacteriological findings and treatment responses do not differ between adults and children.
TI  - Production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies to heat-shock protein 60 of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - Two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), designated as H9 (IgG2a) and H20 (IgM), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60) of Helicobacter pylori strain TK1029 were established. Affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots with MAb H9 and MAb H20 respectively. These antigens also reacted with the 3C8 MAb previously established in this laboratory, which recognised Yersinia enterocolitica HSP60. By amino-acid sequence analysis, the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of the protein recognised by both H9 and H20 MAbs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of H. pylori HSP60 reported previously. Both MAbs reacted with nine strains of H. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot analysis. In addition, MAb H9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria including H. mustelae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Shigella sonnei. In contrast, MAb H20 reacted only with strains H. pylori. These results suggest that both the species-specific epitope recognised by MAb H20 and the common epitope recognised by MAb H9 exist on HSP60 of the bacterial cell. Both MAbs also reacted with the 60-kDa protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (MKN45) cells. It was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with MAb H20. These results suggest that there is a common epitope in H. pylori HSP60 and human gastric epithelial cells.
TI  - Carbenicillin-hydrolysing penicillinase mediated by a plasmid of Proteus mirabilis and its relationship to the PSE-type enzymes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a carbenicillin-hydrolysing (carbenicillinase) gene occurring in an endogenous plasmid, pCS229, of Proteus mirabilis was determined. The amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme, comprising 271 amino acids with a molecular mass of 29,506 Da, was deduced. The pCS229 carbenicillinase showed only 46.4% similarity, in the overall amino acid sequence, to the chromosomal carbenicillinase of Pr. mirabilis GN79; however, the enzyme showed about 98% similarity to a Pseudomonas-specific plasmid-encoded carbenicillinase, PSE-4, that was isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only five of 271 amino acids differed from those of PSE-4. This study proved the close relationship between the carbenicillinase genes distributed in Pr. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - Multicenter laboratory evaluation of the bioMerieux Vitek antimicrobial susceptibility testing system with 11 antimicrobial agents versus members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A four-center study in which a total of 1,082 recent clinical isolates of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were examined versus 11 antimicrobial agents with the bioMerieux Vitek susceptibility test system (Hazelwood, Mo.) and the GNS-F6 card was conducted. In addition, a challenge set consisting of the same 200 organisms was examined in each of the four participating laboratories. Results obtained with the Vitek system were compared to MICs determined by a standardized broth microdilution method. For purposes of comparison, susceptibility categories (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant) were assigned on the basis of the results of both methods. The result of the broth microdilution test was considered definitive. The total category error rate with the Vitek system and the recent clinical isolates (11,902 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 4.5%, i.e., 1.7% very major errors, 0.9% major errors, and 1.9% minor errors. The total category error rate calculated from tests performed with the challenge set (i.e., 8,800 organism-antimicrobial comparisons) was 5.9%, i.e., 2.2% very major errors, 1.1% major errors, and 2.6% minor errors. Very major error rates higher than the totals were noted with Enterobacter cloacae versus ampicillin-sulbactam, aztreonam, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate and with P. aeruginosa versus mezlocillin, ticarcillin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. Major error rates higher than the averages were observed with Proteus mirabilis versus imipenem and with Klebsiella pneumoniae versus ofloxacin. Excellent overall interlaboratory reproducibility was observed with the Vitek system. The importance of inoculum size as a primary determinant in the accuracy of susceptibility test results with the Vitek system was clearly demonstrated in this study. Specifically, when an inoculum density fourfold higher than that recommended by the manufacturer was used, high rates of false resistance results were obtained with cell wall-active antimicrobial agents versus both the Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media in adults. The French Study Group.
AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media is a common and potentially dangerous clinical condition that is difficult to treat because the most common infecting organisms are often resistant to many antibiotics. Recently, fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin have provided a new therapeutic possibility, offering a wide range of antibacterial activity and proven concentration in the middle ear. Therefore in the current study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of suppurative chronic otitis media in adults. One hundred sixty-four patients were enrolled during a 3-month period by 49 ear, nose, and throat physicians in general practice. The mean duration of symptoms was 158 months, with the acute exacerbation lasting 72.5 days. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis were most commonly isolated. At the end of treatment, the otorrhea had disappeared in 104 of the 155 (67.1%) evaluated patients. The bacteriologic eradication rate was 64.5%. After 4 weeks of follow-up care, 93.2% of patients had no recurrence of infection. In 4 patients, treatment was discontinued prematurely after an adverse event. We conclude that ciprofloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated general practice treatment for suppurative chronic otitis media in adults.
TI  - Some pathogenic fungi involved in serious cases of urinary tract infections in Nigeria.
AB  - Three hundred early morning midstream urine samples collected from 200 females and 100 males between the ages of 20 and 60 years, suffering from urinary tract infections (UTI) were studied to determine the etiologic agents. The caliberated loop-direct method used for culturing each sample on both bacterial and fungal media showed significant microbial growth in 117 of the 300 samples. Bacteria were the sole agents of infection in 30% of the cases while pathogenic yeasts were the sole agents of infection in 8% of the cases. Only 1% showed mixed infection. The bacterial pathogens identified from the culture were Escherichia coli (12.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.0%), Proteus mirabilis (4.3%), Klebsiella aerogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus faecalis (2.0%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.3%). The fungal pathogens isolated were Candida albicans (0.3%). While patients between the ages of 20 and 40 years were significantly more susceptible to UTI caused by bacteria (P = 0.05), patients between the ages of 41 and 60 years were more prone to UTI caused by fungi. Also females appeared to contact UTI more often than males.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheter.
AB  - The main objective of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and durability of a novel indwelling bladder catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin. Thirty antimicrobial-impregnated bladder catheters were inserted transurethrally in spinal cord-injured patients and removed, in six groups of five catheters each, at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 or 21 days. Removed catheters had detectable zones of inhibition against two different clinical isolates of each of the 10 tested uropathogens (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Candida albicans) for greater than 14 days after catheter insertion. The residual zones of inhibition and levels of antimicrobial agents in removed catheters were both inversely related to the duration of catheter placement. Minocycline and rifampin were undetectable in serum and urine. These results support the ongoing efforts for examining the clinical efficacy of these experimental bladder catheters.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against 569 gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at Sao Paulo Hospital--UNIFESP/EPM in June and July of 1992. The species distribution was as follows: Enterobacter sp. (62), Escherichia coli (308), Klebsiella pneumoniae (27), Klebsiella sp. (9), Proteus mirabilis (23), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), Pseudomonas sp. (4), Serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives (7). Susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. The antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, DU 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, FK 037, imipenem, meropenem and biapenem. RESULTS: DU 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. It was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. The potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae, except for Enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than they were to cefetazidime or FK 037. When testing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active than imipenem or biapenem. In addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. CONCLUSION: The new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. However, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.
TI  - [Experimental bladder stone production by human uropathogenic bacteria].
AB  - To investigate the formation of infection stones by 5 bacterial species isolated  from patients with urinary calculi, such as Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, a zinc disc was implanted and 10(6) bacteria were surgically inoculated at the same time into the bladder of male Wistar rats (10 rats per group). Urinary pH was measured on days 1, 3, 5 and 7. The rats were killed on day 7 and the bladder examined for the formation of infection stones. Infection stones were formed in all rats inoculated with P. mirabilis (mean stone weight 29.7 mg), and in 60% of those inoculated with S. saprophyticus (9.7 mg). Small bladder stones were formed in 30% of the rats inoculated with K. pneumoniae and 25% of those inoculated with P. aeruginosa. No bladder stones were formed in the rats inoculated with E. coli. Urinary pH was increased by P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus but was unaffected by the other species. In conclusion, P. mirabilis and S. saprophyticus play a significant role in the formation of infection stones.
TI  - Potential virulence factors of Proteus bacilli.
AB  - The object of this review is the genus Proteus, which contains bacteria considered now to belong to the opportunistic pathogens. Widely distributed in nature (in soil, water, and sewage), Proteus species play a significant ecological role. When present in the niches of higher macroorganisms, these species are able to evoke pathological events in different regions of the human body. The invaders (Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and P. penneri) have numerous factors including fimbriae, flagella, outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharide, capsule antigen, urease, immunoglobulin A proteases, hemolysins, amino acid deaminases, and, finally, the most characteristic attribute of Proteus, swarming growth, enabling them to colonize and survive in higher organisms. All these features and factors are described and commented on in detail. The questions important for future investigation of these facultatively pathogenic microorganisms are also discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of blood culture isolates obtained before and after the introduction of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro susceptibilities of 1658 blood culture isolates to ciprofloxacin and 13 other antimicrobial agents were determined, and compared with the results for isolates obtained before and after the availability of ciprofloxacin in 1989. Only six (0.6%) of 995 Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested; all of the ciprofloxacin-resistant strains were isolated after 1989 (P = 0.04). No significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance was found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp. No resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in 124 Staphylococcus aureus isolates prior to 1989, but five (2.4%) of 208 S. aureus strains recovered after 1989 were ciprofloxacin-resistant (P = 0.16). Rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat bacteraemic infections have remained relatively low in this Canadian teaching hospital over the past 16 years.
TI  - A simple artificial urine for the growth of urinary pathogens.
AB  - A simple artificial urine medium (AUM) has been developed which provides conditions similar to that found in human urine. AUM solidified with agar enabled the recovery of a wide range of urease-positive and -negative urinary pathogens. Liquid AUM supported growth at concentrations of up to 10(8) cfu ml-1, as found in normal urine. Reproducible, steady-state growth also occurred over many generations in continuous culture. AUM was capable of forming crystals and encrustations resembling those found in natural urinary tract infections. The medium is a suitable replacement for normal urine for use in a wide range of experiments modelling the growth and attachment of urinary pathogens in the clinical environment.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections: risk factors and therapeutic trends].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common in medical practice. Women have a high prevalence of UTIs, approximately 50 times higher than men. A large proportion of this prevalence is probably caused by anatomic and physical factors Chemical analysis of urine composition, examination of the urinary sediment and the bacterial colony counts are of great value for diagnosis and therapy. The patients may be benefit from antibiotic doses. In addition to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ), amoxicillin and cephalosporins, the authors observed a new drug: fluoroquinolones. These drugs derived by nalidixic acid and included: ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, pefloxacin and rufloxacin. They are sinergistic against most Gram positives and negatives including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Fluoroquinolone is an antibacterial agent that is effective in treating urinary tract infections. It is usually administered orally and is well absorbed after oral ingestion. Quinolones are preferable to TMP/SMZ because of their greater antibacterial activity that occurred in about 82% of women. A dose of quinolones (400 mg daily for 3 days) has been particularly effective in the treatment of UTIs. The amoxicillin-clavulanic acid can be used for treatment even if increased antibiotic resistance. The efficacy, relative safety and low cost of quinolones predispose to utilize its like the first treatment choice.
TI  - [Treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly].
AB  - Sixty outpatients at the age of 65 to 75 years with exacerbated chronic bronchitis were treated with antibiotics: amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (20 patients), cefaclor (20 patients) and ciprofloxacin (20 patients). The treatment course in all the cases was 5 days. Bacteriological tests of the sputum specimens and estimation of the isolate antibiotic susceptibility by the disk diffusion method were applied to all the patients before and after the treatment. 73 per cent of the patients had mixed infection. The microflora mainly included various species of streptococci highly susceptible to the drugs (54 per cent) as well as highly susceptible strains of pneumococci and hemophilic bacilli (33 and 17 per cent respectively). Atypical microflora was detected in 10 per cent of the cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were isolated in 2 cases. Acinetobacter sp. slightly susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. Citrobacter sp. slightly susceptible to cefaclor and moderately susceptible to ciprofloxacin was detected in 1 case. Enterobacter sp. moderately susceptible only to ciprofloxacin was isolated in 1 case. A positive factor was moderate susceptibility of Proteus mirabilis to all the three drugs. In 24 patients (the average age of 54.7 years) the pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin administered under 2 different regimens was studied. The drug was used in a single dose of 400 mg once a day (group 1) or in a dose of 200 mg twice a day (group II) followed by estimation of the drug concentration in the blood and sputum. The pathogen eradication was stated in 61.5 and 72.7 per cent of the patients in groups I and II, respectively. By the results of the treatment with the use of the above mentioned antibiotics in the elderly patients fluoroquinolones should be considered preferable from the clinical and pharmacoeconomic viewpoints.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in chronic inner ear infections in adults].
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically middle ear exudate obtained from 56 patients, aged 17 to 83 years, treated for chronic otitis media. Aerobic bacteria only were found 49 patients (87,5%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 7 patients (12,5%). The most common bacteria isolated from the middle ear exudate, in descending order frequency, were Staphylococcus aureus (45%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (34%), Proteus mirabilis (16%) and Prevotella melaninogenica (9%). Other organisms were isolated less frequently. In 34 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 22 patients the isolated bacteria coexisted with other microorganisms.
TI  - The responses of Lucilia cuprina to odours from sheep, offal and bacterial cultures.
AB  - The responses of gravid female Lucilia cuprina to odours from sheep urine, faeces and gut mucus, and to odours from liver/sodium sulphide mixtures was tested using a bioassay which measured the movement and probing response of walking flies. The same bioassay was used to test the response to odours from cultures of bacteria isolated from liver/sodium sulphide and liver/water mixtures. A significant movement towards odours from faeces, gut mucus and urine was observed. Odours from cultures of the bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Dermatophilus congolensis and Serratia marcescens also elicited significant movement. A probing response was elicited by odours from gut mucus, fresh urine, liver/sodium sulphide mixtures and cultures of P.mirabilis, D.congolensis and gram-positive species. Odours from cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes and Citrobacter freundii did not elicit significant movement or probing. The movement and probing responses are discussed with reference to the possible uses of the substances tested as a bait for attracting L.cuprina.
TI  - Microbiology of otitis externa.
AB  - Microbiologic and clinical data from 26 patients with otitis externa were prospectively evaluated. Specimens were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. A total of 33 aerobic and 2 anaerobic bacteria were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 21 (91%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in 1 (4%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 1 (4%). The most common isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 instances), Staphylococcus aureus (7), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), Proteus mirabilis (2), Enterococcus faecalis (2), Bacteroides fragilis (1), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (1). One isolate was recovered in 13 (57%) patients, 2 isolates in 8 (35%), and 3 isolates in 2 (9%). These data illustrate the polymicrobial nature of otitis externa in about half of the patients and the role of anaerobic bacteria in 8% of them. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic implications of these findings.
TI  - The prevalence of gentamicin 2'-N-acetyltransferase in the Proteeae and its role  in the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan.
AB  - The prevalence of aac(2')-Ia, a gene coding for gentamicin 2'-N-acetyltransferase in Providencia stuartii, among species of the Proteeae was investigated to determine if it is a common resistance factor and whether the correlation observed in P. stuartii between its expression and the levels of peptidoglycan O-acetylation represents a general feature of bacteria producing this form of modified peptidoglycan. An evaluation of the MICs of gentamicin for each of the species of the Proteeae did not reveal any apparent relationship between resistance and the degree of O-acetylation of peptidoglycan. The entire aac(2')-Ia gene was used as a probe in Southern hybridization experiments against genomic DNA from each species of the Proteeae. A sequence with strong homology to aac(2')-Ia was present only in Proteus penneri while weak hybridization was also observed to the restriction digested DNA from Providencia rettgeri. Other bacteria that O-acetylate peptidoglycan were also screened with this probe and a homologous DNA sequence was only found in Neisseria subflava. These data suggest that AAC(2')-Ia may contribute to the O-acetylation of peptidoglycan in P. stuartii, but a more specific enzyme must also be produced for this function.
TI  - A bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica and Morganella morganii at low pH.
AB  - To infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach. In this study, we showed that Y. enterocolitica serotype O8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as pH 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. Acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-pH conditions. Acid tolerance of Helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was not specifically activated by low-pH conditions. A ure mutant strain of Y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea was the sole nitrogen source. Examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that Morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but Escherichia coli 1021, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. Consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases were activated in vitro by low pH with an unusually low activity optimum of pH 5.5. In whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below pH 3.0 for Y. enterocolitica and pH 5.5 for M. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. DNA sequence analysis of portions of the M. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of Y. enterocolitica urease. One region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of Lactobacillus fermentum. This region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases since the L. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low pH optimum for activity.
TI  - An assessment of the ability of a silver-releasing device to prevent bacterial contamination of urethral catheter drainage systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of a silver-releasing device to protect the catheterized bladder from infection by blocking the ascending migration of bacteria from contaminated urine-drainage bags. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A simple physical model of the catheterized bladder and drainage system was used with the device located in the drainage-tube just below the sampling port. Urine was supplied to the model at 1.0 mL/min and the drainage bag was contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Over 10 days, urine from the bag, catheter sampling-port and bladder were examined for contamination. RESULTS: Bacteriological analysis showed that the mean time for test organisms to reach the sampling ports of four different control bag systems ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 days. Urine from the sampling ports of the test systems incorporating the silver device remained sterile for 10 days. The device also prevented the growth of the large populations of bacteria (10(8) colony-forming units per mL) that occurred in the control bags. While scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of bacterial biofilm throughout the control drainage systems, no bacterial colonization was visible on the surfaces of the test systems. Chemical analysis established that the devices consistently generated concentrations of silver in urine ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 micrograms/mL. CONCLUSION: The incorporation of the silver-releasing device into the drainage systems produced an antibacterial barrier which protected the catheterized bladder from intraluminal contamination for at least 10 days. These in vitro tests suggest a useful role for the device in controlling infection in patients undergoing short-term indwelling bladder catheterization.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum.
AB  - Ten sesquiterpene lactones and one sesquiterpene isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum: 1 alpha, 6 alpha -dihydroxyisocostic acid methyl ester (2), 1 alpha-hydroxy-1-deoxoarglanine (3), douglanin (5), santamarin (6), reynosin (7), 1-epitatridin B (8), ludovicin A (10), armexin (12), armefolin (13), armexifolin (14), and 3 alpha-hydroxyreynosin (15) were tested against the human lung carcinoma cell line GLC4 and the colorectal cancer cell line COLO 320 as well as against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and the yeast Candida albicans. In addition, two germacranolides tatridin A (16) and tamirin (17) were included in the study. All compounds showed cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 124 microM) but most of them were not effective in the antimicrobial tests.
TI  - Is the ability of urinary tract pathogens to accumulate glycine betaine a factor  in the virulence of pathogenic strains?
AB  - The regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for Escherichia coli. The clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. Clinical isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. The addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except P. mirabilis. However, when clinical strains of E. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. There was no difference in growth rates of E. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. The ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.
TI  - Evaluation of 500 gram negative isolates to determine the number of major susceptibility interpretation discrepancies between the Vitek and MicroScan Walkaway for 9 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Although the Vitek and MicroScan Walkaway are two of the most commonly used automated antimicrobial susceptibility test systems, few studies have been performed comparing discrepancies between these systems. In this study, 500 Gram negative clinical isolates were tested against ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, ticarcillin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin to determine the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems. The 500 isolates consisted of 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter species. Each isolate was tested simultaneously in both systems using the same standardized inoculum. Eighty-four major discrepancies occurred, of which 48 were reproducible. The reproducible discrepancy rate, for the 4,500 isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested, was 48 of 4500 (1.06%). The rate for individual antimicrobics varied from 17 of 500 (3.4%) for ampicillin to no discrepancies for ticarcillin or ciprofloxacin. Of the 48 reproducible discrepancies, 44 (92%) were Vitek resistant, MicroScan susceptible. Fifteen (31%) of the Vitek and 21 (44%) of the MicroScan results were confirmed by broth microdilution. Disk diffusion results were in agreement with 15 (31%) of the Vitek and 21 (44%) of the MicroScan results. Twelve (25%) of the broth microdilution and 12 (25%) of the disk diffusion results were intermediate. The broth microdilution and disk diffusion results for the 48 isolates with reproducible discrepancies were in agreement more often with MicroScan. However, there was less very major error comparing the Vitek results for these isolates to the broth microdilution and disk diffusion. Overall, the result of this evaluation indicate that the number of major interpretation discrepancies between the two systems is minimal for the isolate/antimicrobic combinations tested.
TI  - Indications and results of pleuropulmonary decortications in the university hospital of Kinshasa.
AB  - In a retrospective and prospective study the authors assess factors influencing postoperative results in patients operated on for pachypleuritis with late referral to the hospital. There were 78 cases in the retrospective (1970-1984) and 28 cases in the prospective (1985-1992) parts of the study. The total number of treated cases is 106 (75 males and 31 females). There were 32 children (> 15 years of age) and 74 adults (< or = 15 years). General condition was good in 45 patients (11 children and 34 adults) and poor in 61 patients (21 children and 40 adults). Ninety percent of the patients were operated on at least one month after the appearance of their symptoms. Eighty-one patients (75.4%) had an empyema secondary to bronchopulmonary infection (34 tuberculous). Other etiologies were: thoracic trauma: 23 cases (19 open and 4 internal); miscellaneous: 2 cases. The commonest isolated organisms were S. aureus, (21.4%), Klebsiella (21.4%) Pseudomonas (13%), Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa (11.9%), E. coli (8.4%) and Pyocyaneus (5.9%). In all cases, a total decortication was performed. Good result was achieved in 55/106 (51.8%). There were 39/106 (36.9%) poor results and 12 operative deaths (11.3%). No correlation could be found between results and age, sex or etiology. A significant correlation appeared between duration of symptoms and postoperative results. The longer the delay; the worse the results.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - Evaluation of CHROMagar Orientation for differentiation and presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli and Enterococcus species.
AB  - A new chromogenic plate medium, CHROMagar Orientation, was evaluated for use in the differentiation and presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli and Enterococcus species by a multipoint inoculation (replicator) technique. In this study, 1,404 gram-negative bacilli and 74 enterococcal isolates were tested on CHROMagar Orientation. Six control American Type Culture Collection strains were also included with the testing to ensure quality control of the media. Of the Escherichia coli isolates (n = 588) tested, 99.3% produced a pink-to-red color. Only in four isolates that were O-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) negative did this result differ. Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris were well differentiated on this medium. P. mirabilis (n = 184) produced a clear colony with diffusible brown pigment around the periphery. By contrast, 15 of 16 P. vulgaris isolates produced bluish-green colonies with a slight brown background. All Aeromonas hydrophila isolates (n = 26) tested produced clear to pink colonies at 35 to 37 degrees C. This colony color changed to blue after 2 to 3 h of incubation at room temperature. A. hydrophila exhibited stronger color and better growth at 30 degrees C. Serratia marcescens (n = 29) demonstrated an aqua blue color that deepened to a darker blue when exposed to room temperature. All enterococcal isolates (n = 74) resulted in a blue color and gave pinpoint colonies on purity subcultures at 35 to 37 degrees C after 18 h of incubation. Similarity in color resulted in failure to discriminate accurately between Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species. However, these species could be readily differentiated from other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 151) was easily differentiated from members of the Enterobacteriaceae but was less easily distinguishable from other gram-negative nonmembers of the Enterobacteriaceae. The medium was found to facilitate easy visual detection of mixed bacterial isolates in culture. When used in a replicator system, it easily detected mixed growths of organisms which may have otherwise led to false antibiotic susceptibility results. These mixed growths were not obvious on the routine susceptibility testing medium (Isosensitest).
TI  - Douglas-fir root-associated microorganisms with inhibitory activity towards fungal plant pathogens and human bacterial pathogens.
AB  - A microbial culture collection composed of 1820 bacterial strains, including 298  actinomycete strains, was established from the roots of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings harvested from conifer nurseries and forest sites. Two hundred and thirty-four strains inhibited the growth of Fusarium, Cylindrocarpon, and (or) Pythium spp. in in vitro assays. A significantly greater proportion of bacterial strains from actinomycete genera exhibited antifungal properties compared with bacterial strains from nonactinomycete genera. Eighty-nine percent of identified inhibitory strains were Streptomyces, Streptoverticillium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, or Burkholderia species. The actinomycete species were isolated almost exclusively from forest seedlings. Recovery of inhibitory strains representing 29 microbial species was enhanced using a variety of methods to isolate microorganisms from the roots of seedlings from nursery and forest sites. Bacterial strains (including actinomycete strains) with antifungal activity were tested for in vitro growth inhibition of six clinical human bacterial pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Forty-eight percent of the tested strains inhibited one or more human pathogens, Inhibitory activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens was strain specific, not species specific, and many inhibitory strains exhibited broad-spectrum activity. Strains with antifungal activity against several conifer root pathogens were also more likely to inhibit multiple species of clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1994 to May 1995 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. No remarkable changes were found in susceptibilities of Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to amikacin and quinolones were better than those in 1993. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to all drugs increased in uncomplicated UTIs. Against E. coli in 1993, the antimicrobial activities of piperacillin, cefotiam and aminoglycosides have decreased, however, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. As for Klebsiella spp. susceptible strains to ABPC decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except minocycline were good. Against P. aeruginosa in 1993, the activities of aminoglycosides have decreased, but, in 1994, these activities have turned to the better state. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
TI  - A human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  - It is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. Previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. This study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. Our study revealed the following: (a) Suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. Of these 20 bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. Eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. This staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. Its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) Sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. This finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing SNHL by therapeutic intervention. Spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing loss in addition to the cochlea. This subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) It has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent SNHL is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible SNHL is caused by serous labyrinthitis. Our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) The data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) There were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. A notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and biapenem (BIPM) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) were not so active with the MIC90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis. MINO showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was < or = 0.125 microgram/ml. CZOP was also active with the MIC90 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, CAZ, LMOX, CRP, cefpodoxime (CPDX), CRMN, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MINO was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - An evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - Tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the TEM and SHV types found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as Bacteroides species. Its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria and anerobes. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of Gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with MIC values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. MICs were determined by agar dilution (NCCLS 1990 and 1992). Piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. It was also active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. It was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species and some high level TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing E. coli and Klebsiella species. Activity against Gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. However some Enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these Class I beta lactamases. Activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for Gram negative rods. Imipenem was the most active agent against ESBL producing Klebsiella species. Piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide Gram positive as well as Gram negative cover of febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - Variations in the fluorescence intensity of intact DAPI-stained bacteria and their implications for rapid bacterial quantification.
AB  - As current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often  imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF) are attractive. In this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic acids are used to identify bacterial cells. Bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with SdFFF if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant. The effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. Specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. Specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. Specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. Such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the SdFFF technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. Moreover, they have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - Piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections: an open non-comparative and multicentered trial.
AB  - The aim of this multicentered, prospective and open study was to determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam (4g/500 mg IV tid) in the treatment of 79 adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) requiring hospitalization. Forty-seven women and 32 men (mean age 54.2 years, and range 21-91) from 4 Argentinean and 6 Mexican hospitals were enrolled. Sixty-one clinically and bacteriologically evaluable patients were treated for a mean of 9.1 days (range 5-15). A favorable clinical response was seen in 83.6% and 80% at early and late assessment, respectively. Bacteriological eradication was achieved in 85.3% and 80% at early and late estimation, respectively. Escherichia coli was isolated in 33 cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 8, Enterococcus spp. in 7, Proteus mirabilis in 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3, Enterobacter spp. and Morganella morganii in 2. While 21% of all the clinical isolates were resistant to piperacillin, none of them was initially resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam. However, one female patient with a persistent UTI caused by E. coli developed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam during treatment. A 64-year-old man with frontal meningioma developed purulent meningitis due to Enterobacter cloacae after neurosurgery. He was initially treated with ciprofloxacin, rifampin and amikacin and because of persistence of fever, he was moved to piperacillin/tazobactam. After 5 days of therapy, he developed coma secondary to intracranial hemorrhage and died. By then, the platelet count was normal (220,000/microliters), but the prothrombin time (19.5 seconds) and the partial thromboplastin time (63 seconds) were significantly prolonged. Our data suggest that piperacillin/tazobactam is a reliable therapy for complicated, non-complicated, community or hospital-acquired UTI.
TI  - Characterization of beta-lactamase gene blaPER-2, which encodes an extended-spectrum class A beta-lactamase.
AB  - Plasmidic extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of Ambler class A are mostly inactive against ceftibuten. Salmonella typhimurium JMC isolated in Argentina harbors a bla gene located on a plasmid (pMVP-5) which confers transferable resistance to oxyiminocephalosporins, aztreonam, and ceftibuten. The beta-lactamase PER-2 (formerly ceftibutenase-1; CTI-1) is highly susceptible to inhibition by clavulanate and is located at a pI of 5.4 after isoelectric focusing. The blaPER-2 gene was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.2-kb insert in vector pBluescript includes an open reading frame of 927 bp. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of PER-2 with those of other beta-lactamases indicates that PER-2 is not closely related to TEM or SHV enzymes (25 to 26% homology). PER-2 is most closely related to PER-1 (86.4% homology), an Ambler class A enzyme first detected in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An enzyme with an amino acid sequence identical to that of PER-1, meanwhile, was found in various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Turkey. Our data indicate that PER-2 and PER-1 represent a new group of Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. PER-2 so far has been detected only in pathogens (S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis) isolated from patients in South America, while the incidence of PER-1-producing strains so far has been restricted to Turkey, where it occurs both in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries.
AB  - Visceral injuries, wound infection and sepsis were investigated in 226 inpatients who sustained electrical burns over a period of 15 years. Four patients who sustained thoracic and abdominal organ injuries were noted in this series. The patients had injuries of the small intestine, stomach, colon and the lung. All the patients received operative treatment. Two of them died of sepsis. Injuries to the internal organs should always be considered following high-voltage injuries, and they should be managed as early as possible. The data concerning wound infection and sepsis following electrical injuries were evaluated in three consecutive 5-year periods. Over this period of 15 years, different antibiotic regimens were used for prophylaxis and treatment. Most patients in the current series had been contaminated or infected by various pathogens prior to admission. Long-lasting administration of prophylactic antibiotics in these patients showed no improvement in controlling the sepsis. After 1987, most of the microorganisms were eliminated following more effective antimicrobial therapy. The progressive decrease in infection frequency of species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae, appeared to be causally related to the changes in the general therapeutic protocol which included new antibiotics. The infections caused by E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed a rather steady state. A marked increase in frequency of negative wound cultures was also noted between the years 1989 and 1993. A gradual decrease in mortality rates was observed from the first to the last 5-year period, whereas mortality rates due to sepsis showed a gradual but slower decline. Sepsis (142 patients comprising 62.8 per cent of the total mortality rate) was the most frequent complication resulting in death.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in laryngectomized patients.
AB  - In laryngectomized patients, the nose does not function. The absence of a physiological airflow stimulus leads to clinical, cytologic and histologic changes of the nasal mucosa. The aim of this study was to identify the nasal cavity bacterial flora in these patients and to determine whether or not it undergoes changes with time. In a group of 25 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken before, and 8 days and 1 month after the surgery. In a group of 15 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken 1 to 2 years postoperatively.
TI  - Lung abscess in patients with AIDS.
AB  - We identified 31 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and lung abscess. All patients had advanced HIV disease, and the mean CD4 cell count was 17/mm3 (range, 2-50/mm3). Twenty-two patients (71%) had previous opportunistic infections, and 24 (77%) had previous pulmonary infections. Symptoms at the time of presentation included fever (90% of patients), cough (87%), dyspnea (35%), pleuritic chest pain (26%), and hemoptysis (10%). The microbiological etiology was established for 28 patients, and the pathogens recovered were bacteria (65%), Pneumocystis carinii (6%), fungi (3%), and mixed microorganisms (16%). The pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), P. carinii (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Aspergillus species (3), viridans streptococcus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), Proteus mirabilis (1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; two patients for whom a microbiological etiology was not established responded to antituberculous therapy. Patients were treated for 2-12 weeks; 25% of the patients received > 4 weeks of therapy. The outcome was poor: 36% of the patients had recurrences, and 19% died. In patients with AIDS, lung abscess is associated with advanced HIV infection, is due to a broad spectrum of pathogens, responds poorly to antibiotics, and has a poor prognosis.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activities and comparative pharmacokinetics of meropenem and imipenem-cilastatin.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) of imipenem and meropenem were investigated in a randomized crossover study. Twelve healthy male volunteers received a constant 30-min infusion of either 1 g of imipenem plus 1 g of cilastatin or 1 g of meropenem. The concentrations of the drugs in serum and urine were determined by bioassay and high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacokinetic parameters were based on an open two-compartment model and a noncompartmental technique. At the end of infusion, the mean concentrations of imipenem and meropenem measured in serum were 61.2 +/- 9.8 and 51.6 +/- 6.5 mg/liter, respectively; urinary recoveries were 48.6% +/- 8.2% and 60.0% +/- 6.5% of the dose in 12 h, respectively; and the areas under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity were 96.1 +/- 14.4 and 70.5 +/- 10.3 mg.h/liter, respectively (P < or = 0.02). Imipenem had a mean half-life of 66.7 +/- 10.4 min; that of meropenem was 64.4 +/- 6.9 min. The volumes of distribution at steady state of imipenem and meropenem were 15.3 +/- 3.3 and 18.6 +/- 3.0 liters/70 kg, respectively, and the mean renal clearances per 1.73 m2 were 85.6 +/- 17.6 and 144.6 +/- 26.0 ml/min, respectively. Both antibiotics were well tolerated in this single-dose administration study. The SBAs were measured by the microdilution method of Reller and Stratton (L. B. Reller and C. W. Stratton, J. Infect. Dis. 136:196-204, 1977) against 40 clinically isolated strains. Mean reciprocal bactericidal titers were measured 1 and 6 h after administration. After 1 and 6 h the median SBAs for imipenem and meropenem, were 409 and 34.9 and 97.9 and 5.8, respectively, against Staphylococcus aureus, 19.9 and 4.4 and 19.4 and 4.8, respectively, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 34.3 and 2.2 and 232 and 15.5, respectively, against Enterobacter cloacae, and 13.4 and 2.25 and 90.7 and 7.9, respectively, against Proteus mirabilis. Both drugs had rather short biological elimination half-lives and a predominantly renal route of elimination. Both carbapenems revealed high SBAs against clinically important pathogens at 1 h; meropenem had a higher SBA against E. cloacae and P. mirabilis, and the SBA of imipenem against S. aureus was greater than the SBA of meropenem.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1993 to May 1994 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to chloramphenicol decreased. As for S. aureus, susceptible strains to minocycline (MINO) decreased in complicated UTIs. As for Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp., their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. Against E. coli, the activities of cefotiam decreased in complicated UTIs, and aminoglycosides decreased. As for Klebsiella spp., susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of P. mirabilis to all drugs except aminoglycosides and MINO were good. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to quinolones isolated from complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter increased, but susceptible strains to aminoglycosides decreased. The susceptibilities of Serratia spp. to MINO has decreased. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
TI  - Isolation and sequence analysis of rpoH genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mRNA and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  - The rpoH genes encoding homologs of Escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): Enterobacter cloacae (gamma), Serratia marcescens (gamma), Proteus mirabilis (gamma), Agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and Zymomonas mobilis (alpha). Comparison of these and three known genes from E.coli (gamma), Citrobacter freundii (gamma) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. Both the sequence complementary to part of 16S rRNA (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mRNA secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in E.coli were found for the rpoH genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. Moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues Q(R/K)(K/R)LFFNLR, designated the 'RpoH box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in DnaK/DnaJ chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. In addition, a putative sigma E (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoH genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. These results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in E.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.
TI  - Corneal ulcers in two institutions in Singapore: analysis of causative factors, organisms and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the causative factors, organisms and antibiotic resistance in patients with bacterial keratitis in Singapore. We analysed retrospectively 103 cases of bacterial keratitis admitted to the Singapore General Hospital or the Singapore National Eye Centre during a 21-month period from March 1992 to December 1993. Contact lens wear represented the largest single predisposing factor (35 eyes, 34.0%), followed by ocular trauma (28 eyes, 27.2%) and pre-existing ocular disease (28 eyes, 27.2%). Thirteen of the twenty-eight cases of trauma-related keratitis were work-related injuries. Gram-negative organisms formed the largest group (41 cultures, 80.4%), with Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most common organism identified (30 eyes). Pseudomonas was also responsible for 78.6% of all contact lens ulcers (11 out of 14 eyes). Resistance to gentamicin was only encountered in 1 case of Proteus mirabilis keratitis. All cases of Pseudomonas infection and 3 of the 10 Gram-positive cases were also resistant to chloramphenicol. All Gram-positive cases were sensitive to cephalosporins. Contact lens wear and ocular trauma are the major preventable risk factors for bacterial keratitis in young sighted eyes in Singapore. Gentamicin continues to be the antibiotic of choice for Gram-negative corneal infections in view of the low incidence of resistance. The routine use of chloramphenicol as the topical antibiotic of choice for corneal infection is not recommended due to the high resistance in Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms locally.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1993 to May 1994.

TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1992). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during June 1992 to May 1993 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated UTIs to quinolones has decreased. As for S. aureus, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., P. mirabilis and Serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. E. coli, all strains were highly susceptibilities to latamoxef and cefozopran. And the susceptibilities of E. coli isolated from uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter to minocycline has decreased in 1991, but they has been indicated a trend of recovery in 1992. The difference in according UTI's classification of the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. to minocycline in 1991 has not recognized in 1992. And the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. isolated from complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter to quinolones has decreased. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa isolated from complicated UTIs to quinolones has been indicated a trend of recovery. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.

TI  - In-vitro production of ethanol in urine by fermentation.
AB  - Driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) can lead to serious injuries to the intoxicated driver and surrounding individuals, in addition to revocation or suspension of driving privileges. The accuracy and interpretation of the testing procedures may be compromised if an individual's urine contains sugar, and either bacteria or yeast. Under these conditions, ethanol can be produced in vitro, producing a result that may be erroneously indicative of DUI. In this study three yeast species and six bacterial species were added to a blank urine sample devoid of any alcohol or sugar. Samples were incubated at 0, 25, and 35 degrees C for 24, 48, and 144 hours in the presence of one of four different sugars. Ethanol concentrations were assayed using an enzymatic alcohol dehydrogenase assay. Results showed that when glucose was used as a substrate, all yeast species (Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida sp. not albicans) and three bacterial species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis) were capable of producing ethanol while the other three (Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp. not aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were not. The rate of ethanol production is temperature dependent and can be inhibited by storage of samples at 0 degrees C or the use of approximately 1% sodium fluoroide as an antimicrobial agent. Many of these species were also able to use other substrates (sucrose, fructose, and galactose) to produce ethanol by fermentation.
TI  - The effect of iontophoresis on bacterial growth in urine.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the effect of iontophoresis (electrical current for therapeutic purposes) on the growth of pathogenic bacteria in human urine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathogenic bacteria were isolated and inoculated into a dynamic in vitro artificial bladder model. Pooled sterile human urine was regulated through the artificial bladder by intravenous tubing and pumps to simulate filling and emptying of the human bladder. The effect of electrical current on bacterial growth in the system was then studied. RESULTS: When iontophoresis is applied at low bacterial concentrations ( < 10(8) colony forming units [CFU]/l.), inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. However, when iontophoresis is applied after fulminant growth of bacteria ( > 10(8) CFU/l.), no inhibition of bacterial growth occurs. Iontophoresis was not found to enhance the antibacterial action of gentamicin to resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Iontophoresis inhibits bacterial growth at low bacterial concentrations. It does not inhibit bacterial growth after infectious levels have been attained, and it does not potentiate the action of gentamicin on resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Etiology and therapy of chronic suppurative otitis.
AB  - Infectious diseases of the ear are important in adults due to their incidence and relapses. We carried out a study of aerobic microorganisms on 251 otic exudates from patients diagnosed as having chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma (119), chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma (85) and chronic external otitis (47). The microorganisms predominantly isolated were, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and other Enterobacteriaceae. 86% of isolates were monomicrobial and 14% of isolates were polymicrobial. In these latter the predominantly isolated microorganisms were also P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Corynebacterium spp. and Proteus mirabilis. P. aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated and showed the highest percentages of resistance against antimicrobial agents tested. P. aeruginosa was most susceptible to ciprofloxacin and imipenem, but much less susceptible to cefotaxime, moxalactam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. S. aureus was highly sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanate, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin and teichoplanin. 100% of the isolates were resistant to penicillin G and ampicillin.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1991). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during June 1991 to May 1992 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to cefmenoxime and amikacin has decreased. As for Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., P. mirabilis and Serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, 1990 and 1991, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. The susceptibilities of E. coli to minocycline was observed a very clear alteration, that is, in uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, the susceptibilities has decreased. However, the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp. was not observed an obvious variation. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to quinolones isolated from uncomplicated UTIs has clearly decreased. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.

The susceptibilities of E. faecalis to minocycline (MINO) and ofloxacin (OFLX) has decreased. As for Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and P. mirabilis, which were detected very few in 1989 and 1990, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. The susceptibilities of E. coli to MINO was observed a very clear alteration, that is, in uncomplicated UTIs and complicated UTIs, the susceptibilities has decreased. However, the susceptibilities of Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa and Serratia spp. were not observed an obvious variation.
TI  - Survival of enterobacteria in liquid cultures during microwave radiation and conventional heating.
AB  - Bacteria in food have been reported to survive in larger numbers after processing by microwave radiation than after conventional processing. The bactericidal effect of a domestic microwave oven (SHARP R-7280) on certain pathogenic enterobacteria species was investigated in vitro, in comparison with conventional heating (boiling). The death rates of different nosocomial strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella sofia, Salmonella enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. The microwave oven and the conventional heating system used were both calibrated in order to calculate temperatures from exposure times. For each strain duplicate samples of 25 ml of pure culture with concentrations at least 10(6) cfu/ml were exposed to microwave radiation. An equal number of samples of the same volume and concentration were exposed to conventional heating. Subsequently all samples were examined qualitatively and quantitatively following standard microbiological procedures. The results indicate that microwaves have an efficient bactericidal effect on the enterobacteria in liquid cultures.
TI  - [Effects of the most frequently used solutions and ointments in routine surgical  practice].
AB  - The authors tested the effect of local antiseptics commonly used at the Clinic of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery in Brno on bacteria which most frequently infect extensive skin defects. The experiments were carried out in vitro and in vivo in a group of experimental animals. In vivo the effect on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated, in vitro also the effect on Proteus mirabilis. The authors found that 0.1% Persteril, Peru balsam, and Dermazine ung./Lek Co./exerted a very favourable effect on the tested microorganisms. A weaker effect was recorded after Vishnevsky balsam and 0.5% Rivanol. 0.5% gentian violet and 3% boricacid had no effect on P. aeruginosa, 0.05% permanganate and 2% Jodonal had no effect on staphylococci.
TI  - The detection of raised levels of IgM to Proteus mirabilis in sera from patients  with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - An analysis by ELISA of 100 rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive sera selected at random from a collection of sera from patients with various auto-immune diseases and joint pains, and 100 RF-negative sera from the same collection matched by patient age and gender, showed that the RF-positive sera had highly significantly (p < 0.0001) raised levels of IgM antibody, but not IgG antibody, to Proteus mirabilis over those of the RF-negative sera. This response was subsequently found to be associated with sera from patients who clinically had rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Sera from the RA patients had significantly greater amounts (p = 0.026) of IgM antibody to P. mirabilis than to the other organisms tested and these values were also highly significantly different (p < 0.0001) from P. mirabilis IgM antibody levels in matched RF-negative sera. Sera from RA patients also had significantly greater amounts of IgA to P. mirabilis (p < 0.0001) and greater amounts of IgM to Escherichia coli (p < 0.0001) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (p < 0.0001) than those in matched RF-negative sera. Other classes of antibody to these organisms and all classes of antibody to Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not raised in the sera of RA patients over those of RF-negative controls. The IgM response in RA patients was not specific for only one O serotype of P. mirabilis but was associated with all 11 different O serotypes of P. mirabilis tested and those of other Proteus spp. Moreover, the IgM antibodies to Proteus spp. appeared to be independent from C-reactive protein and RF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia spp. isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during June 1989 to May 1990 to various antimicrobial agents were compared with those in the same period of previous years according to a classification, uncomplicated UTIs, complicated UTIs without indwelling catheter, and complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. As for Citrobacter spp., P. mirabilis and Serratia spp., which were detected very few in 1989, their susceptibilities were not observed an obvious change. As for Enterobacter spp., the susceptible strains to flomoxef, cefixime, cefuzonam and ceftazidime increased in complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. The susceptibilities of E. coli to penicillins increased slightly in complicated UTIs with indwelling catheter. Against Klebsiella spp., a good activity of minocycline or cephems was found. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin and new quinolones increased in uncomplicated UTIs. These data should be considered in clinical treatment of various urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The followings, ampicillin (ABPC) and vancomycin (VCM) showed potent activities, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC), minocycline (MINO) and chloramphenicol (CP) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus VCM showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Dicloxacillin (MDIPC) and arbekacin (ABK) were active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. MINO showed the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. All other agents except ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed lower activity. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis MINO showed the highest activity against S. epidermidis. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. The followings, ABK and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others except CPFX were not so active. 4. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) Most of the agents were active against CNS. IPM, ABK and MINO showed the highest activities with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MDIPC, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml. Clindamycin (CLDM) showed lower activity, with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. Streptococcus agalactiae CEZ, cefuzonam (CZON), IPM and CLDM showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the MIC of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The followings, cefmenoxime (CMX) and erythromycin (EM) were active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. PIPC and VCM were also active with the MIC90S 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively Amikacin (AMK) showed lower activity. Escherichia coli IPM, CTM, flomoxef (FMOX), CMX, carumonam (CRMN), norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX) and CPFX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were .125 microgram/ml or below. ceftazidime (CAZ) and CZON were also active with the MIC90S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins except mecillinam (MPC) were not so active showing the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneuminiae FMOX, CMX, cefixime (CFIX), IPM, CRMN and NFLX showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Determination of muramic acid in organic dust by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
AB  - A method is described for the quantitation of muramic acid, a marker of bacterial peptidoglycan, in organic dust. House dust samples were hydrolysed in hydrochloric acid and then extracted with hexane to remove hydrophobic compounds. The aqueous phase was evaporated, heated in a silylation reagent to form trimethylsilyl derivatives, and analysed by gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. The muramic acid derivative gave two peaks upon injection into the gas chromatograph--mass spectrometer. Injection of 10 pg of the derivative gave a signal-to-noise ratio of 17 for the dominating peak when using selected ion monitoring in the electron impact mode, and a linear calibration curve was achieved upon analysis of samples containing 5-1500 ng of muramic acid. In a house dust sample, 40 ng of muramic acid was found per mg of dust; the coefficient of variation was 8.2% (n = 6, 1.2 mg of dust analysed). The described method is rapid and simple to apply, and should therefore become widely used for measuring peptidoglycan in many types of environmental samples, including organic dust.
TI  - Imipenem resistance in clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis associated with alterations in penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Two strains of Proteus mirabilis, IpR1 and IpR2, resistant to both imipenem and mecillinam, but susceptible to other beta-lactams were isolated from blood cultures of patients who had been treated with imipenem. Strain IpR1 was isolated in the same sample as a P. mirabilis IpS1 which was susceptible to imipenem and mecillinam. Strains IpR1 and IpR2 did not produce a beta-lactamase and their outer membrane protein profiles were similar to those of IpS1 and P. mirabilis ATCC 29906. Electrophoretic profiles of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) showed a decrease in PBP 1A of strains IpR1 and IpR2 compared with IpS1 and ATCC 29906. Competition experiments revealed a decrease in affinity of PBP 2 for imipenem from strain IpR1. These findings suggest that imipenem resistance in P. mirabilis might result from altered PBPs, as reported for Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Inhibitory action of metabolites of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  - Fifty clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested for inhibition of growth of clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella infantis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other Gram-negative bacteria in the authors' laboratory. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was strongly active against both E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae, with 89.4% and 94.7% inhibition respectively, but weakly active against S. infantis, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis with 56.3%, 48.8% and 23.8% inhibition, respectively. The pigmented strains were found to have stronger antimicrobial activity than the unpigmented strains. Pyocyanin, the major metabolite of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been shown to inhibit Escherichia coli, Proteus spp. and other Gram-negative bacteria, by research with a few strains of P. aeruginosa and a single inhibited strain. However, little attempt has been made to determine the inhibitory action of many strains of P. aeruginosa against a large number of clinical isolates such as Escherichia spp., Klebsiella spp., and Salmonella spp., up to now. For this reason, in this study we examined 50 randomly selected clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa for inhibition of growth of a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria, including 30 strains of E. coli, 30 of K. pneumoniae, 30 of S. infantis, 6 of Enterobacter cloacae and 9 of Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Buffering capacity and H+ membrane conductance of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Buffering capacity and membrane H+ conductance were examined in seven Gram-negative species: Aquaspirillum serpens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Aeromonas hydrophila. All strains of Enterobacteriaceae studied here showed a decrease in both parameters as the external pH increased, over the pH range studied. The other four species presented an increase in buffering capacity and membrane conductance to protons as the external pH increased from 5.5 to 7.0.
TI  - Studies on microbial aerobic flora of skin in leprosy patients.
AB  - This study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. These include 56 paucibacillary (PB) and 73 multibacillary (MB) cases. Thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. The non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically PB leprosy (TT/BT/I) patients were: (1) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus(1), Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Bacillus subtilis(1), Corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(1), Proteus mirabilis(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). The isolates from clinically MB leprosy (BB/BL/LL) patients were: (a) Gram-positive cocci: Micrococci(1), Staphylococcus aureus(1) and Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1); Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1). (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Proteus mirabilis(2). The specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. These were (a) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus albus(2), Staphylococcus aureus(2) and Micrococci(2); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1), Bacillus subtilis(2), Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(3), Proteus vulgaris(1) and Proteus mirabilis(1). While these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and PB/MB types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out subtypes if any.
TI  - Comparison of the efficacy and safety of isepamicin and amikacin in the treatment of skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Two hundred and three patients with skin and skin structure infections were treated with isepamicin once daily or amikacin twice daily in an open, randomised, comparative multicentre trial. Patients were randomised to treatment with isepamicin or amikacin in a 2:1 ratio. Severe infections (63 patients) were treated with isepamicin 15 mg/kg once daily (n = 15) or amikacin 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (n - 18), less severe infections (140 patients) with isepamicin 8 mg/kg once daily (n = 93) or amikacin 7.5 mg/kg twice daily (n = 47). The overall clinical response rate at the end of treatment was excellent in all treatment groups (94-96% cured or improved) with no significant differences between isepamicin and amikacin in patients with either server or less severe infections. The most commonly isolated target pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Overall, in patients who had a valid target pathogen isolated prior to treatment and who met other evaluability criteria, bacteriological eradication was achieved in over 90% of patients; amikacin patients with severe infections had a somewhat lower eradication rate (82%). Over all infections, 4/110 (4%) patients in the isepamicin group and 5/54 (9%) patients in the amikacin had organisms which persisted. Adverse events were reported in 12% of patients in the isepamicin group and 6% in the amikacin group. The most frequently reported adverse event in the isepamicin group as headache. Two patients (one in each treatment group), both of whom experienced skin rashes, were withdrawn. Potentially clinically significant changes in serum creatinine occurred in two patients, who received isepamicin and one who received amikacin (who was withdrawn from the study). Ototoxicity was rare, occurring in one patient treated with isepamicin.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Effect of salicylate on expression of flagella by Escherichia coli and Proteus, Providencia, and Pseudomonas spp.
AB  - Osmotic stress, salicylate, and Mar (multiple antibiotic resistance) mutation are known to block the expression of the OmpF porin. Since these conditions have also been shown to inhibit the expression of P and CFA fimbriae in Escherichia coli, we speculated that they might affect the expression of flagella as well. Hyperosmotic conditions have been shown to block the synthesis of flagellin and expression of flagella in E. coli (C. Li, C. J. Louise, W. Shi, and J. Adler, J. Bacteriol. 175:2229-2235, 1993). In the current study, sodium salicylate was found to inhibit the motility of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner. Swarming did not occur at 20 mM sodium salicylate. Salicylate also blocked the synthesis of flagellin in E. coli. Phenotypic Mar mutants of E. coli derived from motile strains were amotile. Flagella were markedly reduced as determined by scanning electron microscopy when P. mirabilis was grown in broth containing 20 mM salicylate. Salicylate had no apparent effect, however, on expression of a 40-kDa porin protein in P. mirabilis. This finding suggests that the noted effect of salicylate on Proteus spp. may be mediated through a mechanism other than porin production or that the Proteus porin may not be analogous to OmpF in E. coli. Salicylate decreased the motility of Pseudomonas cepacia but had no effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The exact mechanism by which salicylate exerts its effect is not known, but it appears to be related to osmoregulation.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of antiseptics in vitro and in an experiment in vivo].
AB  - The effect of topical antiseptics routinely used in the Department of plastic and aesthetic surgery was tested against bacteria commonly infecting burns and major skin defects. In vivo, the effect on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined, in vitro also on Proteus mirabilis. A very good effect on tested microorganisms was observed with 0.1% Persteril, Peruvian balsam and Dermazin crm. (Lek, Ljubljana). Gentian violet in a 0.5% concentration and 3% boric acid were not effective on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.05% permanganate and 2% Jodonal were moreover not effective against S. aureus.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in soft contact lens wearers.
AB  - We prospectively analyzed bacterial contamination in 15 soft contact lens wearing subjects. Contact lenses, cases, tips of saline solution bottles, and conjunctiva were cultured. Cultures were positive for 13 subjects (86.6%). Contamination was present in 13 contact lens cases (86.6%), 12 contact lenses (80.0%), nine saline solution bottles (60.0%), and in the conjunctiva of three patients (20.0%). Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis) were the most frequently isolated organisms. Staphylococcus aureus was the only gram-positive organism isolated. We discuss the possible sources of contamination, and emphasize the importance of contact lens care instruction.
TI  - [Phenotypes of resistance to antibiotics of the most frequently isolated strains  in five specialized hospital centers. Multicenter study].
AB  - Antibiotic susceptibility of 948 bacterial strains isolated from varied samples essentially proceeding from urinary infections in five Paris psychiatric Hospitals was determined by disk diffusion method. E. coli, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa et S. aureus are the predominant bacteria. 40% of S. aureus are methicilline resistant. Enterobacteriaceae are progressively becoming resistant to aminopenicillines, but remain sensitive to third generation cephalosporines. They are still susceptible to first generation quinolones. At least, if no resistance of P. aeruginosa to imipeneme has been reported, 30% of strains are resistant to ciprofloxacine. Resistance phenotypes to antibiotics of the strains isolated in patients from psychiatric Hospitals are located between those observed in out patients and in patients from general Hospitals. However, we noticed a worrying evolution of resistance to those encontered in psychiatric Hospitals. Therefore, a multiresistant strains emergence monitoring must be carried out regulary.
TI  - The danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  - Two strains-S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. After application in the surgery ward, two Enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. The resistant bacteria, B. cereus and 4 strains of Ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. In hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. Only one of them was S. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. Most of them were isolated from the floor, but also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. The most dangerous were three Gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. They were isolated from the floor (Enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (Proteus mirabilis) and from the container with oral mixture in infant ward (Ps. malthophilia). Many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: Enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), Citrobacter freundi, Ps. aeruginosa, Ps. cepacia (2 strains), Ps. maltophilia (2 strains) and Moraxella. Many resistant strains were also present on the walls (E. coli, Ps. mirabilis, Ps. cepacia, Alcaligens, Acinetobacter). The resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. Klebsiella oxytoca and Ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, Ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies to Pseudomonas pseudomallei and their potential for diagnosis of melioidosis.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens were  produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a crude whole cell extract. Hybrids secreting MAbs specific for P. pseudomallei antigens were identified by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a panel of crude whole cell extracts from P. pseudomallei, P. cepacia, P. aeruginosa, P. putida, P. alcaligenes, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, S. krefeld, S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Of the six specific clones, clone 5F8, which was IgM-producing and which reacted with all 56 P. pseudomallei isolates, was selected for further characterization and evaluation of its possible diagnostic potential. Results obtained from the indirect ELISA against various P. pseudomallei antigens, from direct bacterial agglutination, and from immunofluorescence tests suggested that 5F8 reacted with the surface envelope, and probably specifically with an epitope of the lipopolysaccharide. The antibody could be readily used to identify P. pseudomallei in primary culture or in a simulated hemoculture. The antibody was also used to prepare an affinity-purified antigen for use in an indirect ELISA that was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of circulating antibody in patients with acute septicemic melioidosis.
TI  - In vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  - Many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. It has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary pH, with consequent stone formation. Unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g. Escherichia coli). It has been recently reported that E. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. This study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus. Subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (P < 0.003) reduce the UK activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. The urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, M. luteus, was, however, the exception (P = 0.1079). In contrast to S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and M. luteus (P < 0.0213), P. mirabilis and S. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase activity (P < 0.4047). These results may explain why Proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. According to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. These conditions may lead to renal stone formation. An increase in urinary pH resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. It is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double role in renal stone formation.
TI  - Intracranial complications of suppurative otitis media: 13 years' experience.
AB  - Among 24,321 patients with otitis media treated at the Otolaryngology Department  of Chiang Mai University Hospital from 1978 through 1990, 87 patients had 140 central nervous system complications (0.36%). Multiple complications existed simultaneously in almost 45% of the patients. The group developing the complications were mainly in their second decade of life. Meningitis occurred in 43 patients, brain abscess in 29, perisinus abscess in 23, lateral sinus thrombosis in 16, and extradural abscess in 12 patients. The most striking symptoms and signs were increasing otorrhea, visible cholesteatoma and/or granulations, fever, headache and otalgia, and vestibular symptoms. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcal organisms were found in almost 80% of patients. Overall mortality was 18.4% with brain abscess being the main cause (31%). Epidemiologic presentation, clinical features, and results of treatment for each disease are compared and contrasted to those of previous studies.

TI  - Effects of silver on adherence of bacteria to urinary catheters: in vitro studies.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, mostly from complicated urinary tract infections, showed reduced adherence to silver-treated silicone or latex catheters as compared with latex or silicone catheters. The relative degrees of cell adherence to catheters at 2 h or 18 h, as indicated by radiolabeled cell assays, were in general agreement with growth rate-reduction assays and scanning-electron-microscopy data. For strains of E. coli, the correlation between cell hydrophobicity and degree of adherence to catheters was not significant. Antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, sulfathiazine, neomycin, kanamycin) and silver resistance were not associated. The radiolabel adherence procedure provided a quantitative method for evaluating the relative antimicrobial efficacy of silver-treated catheters.
TI  - [Antimicrobial and sporicidal efficacy of various disinfectant solutions].
AB  - The often indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents has led to increased bacterial resistance over the past years. This phenomenon is above all evident in nosocomial environments but also at a community level. It is therefore important that, in addition to the rational use of antibiotics, an accurate prophylaxis is performed which includes the correct use of disinfectants. This study examines the antimicrobial activity of various commercially available disinfectant solutions consisting of one or more active ingredients. An analysis of the results reveals that products consisting of an association of individual components (quaternary ammonium chloride with o-phenylphenol and/or isopropyl alcohol; chlorhexidine with benzalkonium chloride or with diazolidinylurea and isopropanol) demonstrate a greater efficacy in terms of microbicidal concentration and contact times.
TI  - Rapid identification of micro-organisms from urinary tract infections by beta-glucuronidase, phenylalanine deaminase, cytochrome oxidase and indole tests on isolation media.
AB  - Two commercially available media recommended for the isolation and rapid identification of Escherichia coli from urinary tract infections were supplemented with L-phenylalanine and L-tryptophan. The non-selective medium proved suitable for the direct detection of lactose fermentation, beta-glucuronidase and phenylalanine deaminase activities, indole production and the oxidase test. It was highly efficient in making a presumptive identification at species level of the most common gram-negative urinary pathogens, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that account for c. 85% of all urinary isolates. Among the gram-positive isolates, most colonies were non-fluorescent and could be separated into staphylococci and enterococci on the basis of the catalase test. Fluorescent colonies were found to be Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates, 61% of which were fluorescent. The selective medium proved suitable for the same biochemical tests, with the exception of indole, which was not visible against the red colour of the medium. Therefore, the differentiation of P. mirabilis from other Proteus-Providencia species was impossible on this medium.
TI  - Isolated fibrils rescue cohesion and development in the Dsp mutant of Myxococcus  xanthus.
AB  - Extracellular fibrils are involved in cell cohesion and cell development in Myxococcus xanthus. One group of social motility mutants, Dsp, is unable to produce extracellular fibrils; these mutants also lose the abilities to cohere and to develop. Extracellular fibrils isolated from vegetative wild-type cells and added to Dsp cells fully restored the abilities of these cells to cohere and to undergo normal morphological development. The fibrils thus mimic the ability of intact, wild-type cells to carry out the same rescue. Optimal cohesion rescue by fibrils required calcium and magnesium ions, did not require protein synthesis, but was energy dependent, i.e., sodium azide and sodium cyanide blocked rescue. Cohesion rescue was also blocked by the diazo dye Congo red. Cohesion rescue is genus specific, i.e., isolated fibrils did not cause the cohesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, or the related myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca. Developmental rescue of Dsp by isolated fibrils included aggregation, fruiting body formation, and myxospore morphogenesis. Developmental gene expression in the Dsp mutant was only partially rescued by the isolated fibrils.
TI  - [Experimental study on the role of bacteria from urinary tract infections on the  bladder carcinogenesis].
AB  - The role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological factor in the development of bladder cancer. The bacterial strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with UTI at the Kyushu University Hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mM) in a growth medium (pH 7.2) at 37 degrees C. Of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microM NO2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of E. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microM) could be detected. Various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. The effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. The mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees C was assayed by the Ames Salmonella/microsome test (using TA100 or TA98 with S9-mix). The mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing S. marcescens or P. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. Potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an XAD-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 3 for 4 hrs. The potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. The mutagen formation at an optimal pH 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. It was noted that even at a physiological pH 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. The mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 6. Mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. The levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Analysis of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable peptidoglycan autolysins of select  gram-negative pathogens by using renaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - For the first time, peptidoglycan autolysins from cellular fractions derived from sonicated cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Escherichia coli W7, Klebsiella pneumoniae CWK2, and Proteus mirabilis 19 were detected and partially characterized by zymogram analysis. Purified murein sacculi from P. aeruginosa PAO1 were incorporated into a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel at a concentration of 0.05% (wt/vol) to serve as a substrate for the separated autolysins. At least 11 autolysin bands of various intensities with M(r)s ranging between 17,000 and 122,000 were detected in each of the homogenated cultures. Some of the autolysins of the four bacteria had similar M(r)s. The zymogram analysis was used to show that a number of the autolysins from E. coli were inhibited by the heavy metals Hg2+ and Cu2+, at 1 and 10 mM, respectively, high ionic strengths, and reagents known to affect the packing of lipopolysaccharides. The activity of an autolysin with an M(r) of 65,000 was also impaired by penicillin G, whereas it was enhanced by gentamicin. A preliminary screen to determine the relationship between penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and autolysins was carried out by using a dual assay in which radiolabelled penicillin V bands were visualized on an autolysin zymogram. Radiolabelled bands corresponding to PBPs 3, 4, 5, and 6 from E. coli and P. aeruginosa; PBPs 3, 4, and 6 from Proteus mirabilis; and PBP 6 from K. pneumoniae degraded the murein sacculi in the gels and were presumed to have autolytic activity, although the possibility of two distinct enzymes, each with one of the activities, comigrating in the SDS-polyacrylamide gels could not be excluded. Some radiolabelled bands possessed an Mr of <34,000 and coincided with similar low-Mr autolysin bands.
TI  - [Agents of clinically significant bacteriuria].
AB  - Bacterial composition of cultures isolated from 468 patients hospitalized at the  urologic surgery department was analyzed to elucidate the etiologic structure of clinically significant bacteriurias. A total of 342 bacterial cultures were isolated. In 63.7% of cases monocultures were isolated, in 66.7% the isolated cultures were referred to Enterobacteriaceae and in 18.7% to Pseudomonas. The most significant agents of bacteriurias were Escherichia coli. Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Efficacy of a novel injectable cephalosporin, Cefclidin, on the experimental complicated urinary tract infections with urinary stones caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - We evaluated the effects of a novel cephalosporin, cefclidin (CFCL) and imipenem  (IPM), on the eradication of bacteria from the urine, bladder stones and the kidneys, and also on the prevention of the infection stone formations, in our polymicrobial urinary tract infection model of rats associated with bladder stones using IMP-sensitive or IPM-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis as a causative pathogen. CFCL completely eradicated P. mirabilis from the urine and the stone in the short-term regimen (5 days). CFCL completely eradicated both IPM-sensitive P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis from the urine, the stones and the kidneys as compared to IPM in the long-term regimen (11 days), reflecting the superior antibacterial activity of CFCL. CFCL also significantly prevented the development of infection stones as compared to IPM in the long-term regimen. There was no significant difference in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values between the CFCL or IPM-treated and the non-treated groups. The cumulative recovery rate of unchanged CFCL reached 47.3% of the total dosage (20 mg/kg) within 8 hours.
TI  - The features and aetiology of Fournier's gangrene.
AB  - This paper reports a clinical study of 20 cases of gangrenous ulcers of the scrotum and/or of the penis (Fournier's gangrene) and a review of previous publications. Even though found mostly in elderly male patients, the disease spares no age group and can involve the external genitalia in neonates and women as well. The disease is a necrotising fasciitis of infective origin and always has a portal of entry of the infecting organisms even though it may be so trivial as to be undetected. The commonest portals of entry of infection are periurethral sepsis, groin wound sepsis, anorectal sepsis, prostatic sepsis and trauma. The infecting organisms comprise both aerobic and anaerobic organisms such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis and anaerobic streptococcus. Fournier's gangrene is probably the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis occurring in other parts of the body, but modified by the peculiar anatomy of the genitoperineum.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of isepamicin against fresh clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of isepamicin (ISP), MICs of ISP as well  as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many strains of Gram-negative bacilli that were clinically isolated in 1993. 1. No ISP-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp. or Proteus mirabilis. 2. ISP-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The frequency of resistant strains in each species, however, was lower for ISP than other AGs. 3. When MIC90s were compared, antibacterial activities of ISP determined in this study were quite similar to those determined during the drug's development period (1980's) in Japan, suggesting no increase in the number of ISP-resistant strains over the years. 4. The number of clinically isolated Gram-negative bacilli resistant to multiple drugs are increasing in from year to year Japan. Our results in this study suggest that antibacterial activities of ISP may be potent enough against such Gram-negative bacilli resistant to multiple drugs.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate administration dose of arbekacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in the disk susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (ABK) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the ABK disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of ABK. The 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy were studied. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC90 values of ABK against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC90 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. The disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disk manual. The inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with MICs. Results of ABK disk susceptibility test with 30, 10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, P < 0.01). In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values of ABK proposed are (+ + +) MIC < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) MIC > 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. With 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. Similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. In the break point classification system of Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the MIC break point for ABK proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. It appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with MIC values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. A pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for ABK (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of ABK reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Investigation of synergism with combinations of dibromopropamidine isethionate or propamidine isethionate and polymyxin B.
AB  - Combinations of polymyxin B and dibromopropamidine isethionate exhibited synergistic inhibitory and bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Similar results were obtained with polymyxin B plus propamidine combinations except that propamidine was not as active as dibromopropamidine and the combination of polymyxin B plus propamidine against S. aureus only had additive activity. The antibacterial agents were tested in solutions and in a cream formulation. The findings indicate a potential for the use of selected combinations of these antibacterial agents in the treatment of wound and superficial eye infections.
TI  - Enhanced staining of bacterial flagella using aged mordant in the silver stain.
AB  - Intensity of bacterial flagella staining using a modified silver stain was increased by aging the mordant for one week at room temperature. The use of aged mordant increased the apparent diameters of stained flagella and resulted in a darker stain. The mordant remained stable for at least four months at room temperature. The staining protocol presented allows application to liquid or solid cultures.
TI  - Proteolytic activity and fatal gram-negative sepsis in burned mice: effect of exogenous proteinase inhibition.
AB  - Circulating proteolytic activity (PA) increases following burn or surgical trauma. Challenging traumatized mice with the yeast Candida albicans further increases PA. Once a PA threshold has been passed, mortality increases as PA increases. The purposes of this study were to determine (i) if gram-negative bacterial challenge affects circulating PA and mortality as Candida challenge does and (ii) if proteinase inhibitor treatment with aprotinin, antithrombin III, and alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor decreases circulating PA and increases the survival of burned mice infected with a bacterium. For all bacteria tested (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), burn plus challenge significantly elevated PA and mortality above levels in mice that were only burned or only challenged. Quantitative culture counts indicated that the mice died of sepsis. Proteinase inhibitor treatment of mice burned and challenged with K. pneumoniae significantly decreased circulating PA, decreased the hepatic microbial load, and increased survival. Hence, in traumatized mice challenged with either C. albicans or gram-negative bacteria, a relationship exists between proteolytic load and subsequent septic death. Parallels between these animal studies and human studies are discussed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of aztreonam against clinical isolates].
AB  - To evaluate the antibacterial activity of a monobactam antibiotic, aztreonam (AZT), MICs of AZT and other antibiotics against clinical isolates collected at 36 participating institutions after January 1992 were determined using the agar plate dilution method (size of inoculum, 10(6) cfu/ml) according to the Japan Society of Chemotherapy standard. The antibiotics that were tested along with AZT included piperacillin (PIPC), cefoperazone (CPZ), and amikacin (AMK). AZT was found to be more active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri than CPZ, PIPC, and AMK. AZT was also more active against Serratia marcescens than the other antibiotics, but about 6% of the strains tested were resistant to AZT with MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii, however, was more active AMK than AZT. AZT showed a normal activity distribution with a single peak at the MIC of 3.13-6.25 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 35% of inoculum was resistant with high MIC values (MIC > or = 25 micrograms/ml). Activities of AZT against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were comparable to those of CPZ.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of Pseudomonas pseudomallei flagellin proteins.
AB  - Flagellin proteins from several different strains of Pseudomonas pseudomallei have been isolated and purified to homogeneity by mechanical shearing and differential centrifugation techniques. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded flagellin monomer protein bands with an estimated M(r) of 43,400. No lipopolysaccharide contamination of the purified protein preparations was detectable by silver staining of flagellin displayed on polyacrylamide gels and by Western immunoblotting with P. pseudomallei antilipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the flagellin protein of P. pseudomallei 319a revealed significant homology with flagellins from Proteus mirabilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the 319a flagellin protein reacted with 64 of 65 P. pseudomallei strains tested. The polyclonal antiserum proved effective in inhibiting the motility of these organisms in motility agar plates. Passive immunization studies demonstrated that 319a flagellin-specific antiserum was capable of protecting diabetic rats from challenge with a heterologous P. pseudomallei strain.
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates from urinary tract to antimicrobial agents in Japan, 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of urinary tract isolates to antimicrobial agents examined at 123 hospital laboratories in Japan from September to December in 1991. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory. The susceptibility testing was performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. MRSA showed high resistance rates to all agents tested except to minocycline (MINO). MSSA had good susceptibility to imipenem (IPM) and cephalosporins with susceptibility rates higher than 90%. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to IPM, ampicillin and piperacillin (PIPC) and highly resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin (GM), erythromycin, clindamycin and MINO. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX). High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii to IPM, GM, and OFLX and of Serratia marcescens for IPM and GM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly susceptible to IPM, ceftazidime, AMK, cefsulodin, cefoperazone, PIPC in this order.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of crude extracts of Mitracarpus villosus.
AB  - Mature leaves and inflorescence of Mitracarpus villosus, collected from Niger State, Nigeria, were shade dried over a period of 5 days, ground into fine particles in a Waring blender and extracted individually with hot distilled water and 95% ethanol. The crude extracts obtained were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activities using agar diffusion and tube dilution techniques. The extracts produced zones of inhibition (8-23 mm) against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were not inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the effective extracts were in the range 0.06-8.0 mg/ml, while the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were in the range 0.06-32.0 mg/ml. The ethanolic extracts appeared to exert more inhibitory action against the bacteria than the hot water extracts.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary cellulitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis.
AB  - Eight episodes of gram-negative bacillary cellulitis in seven patients with hepatic cirrhosis are reported. The patients comprised five women and two men (mean age 59.6 years). The diagnosis was based on a positive culture of specimens obtained by needle aspiration from cutaneous lesions. All patients had grade C cirrhosis according to Pugh's classification. Cellulitis involved the lower extremities in all cases. Five patients developed bullous lesions, three ulcers, two abscesses and two extensive cutaneous necrosis. A single bacterial species was found in seven cases. Organisms isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 cases), Escherichia coli (2 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 cases), Proteus mirabilis (1 case) and Aeromonas hydrophila (1 case). Bacteremia was documented in six cases. Four patients died, death being related to sepsis in three of them. It is concluded that gram-negative bacilli should be considered as possible pathogens in severe infectious cellulitis in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Microbiological study of cutaneous specimens obtained by needle aspiration may be of high diagnostic value in these cases.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of combinations of EDTA-Tris and amikacin or neomycin on the microorganisms associated with otitis externa in dogs.
AB  - Combinations of EDTA-Tris and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (amikacin and neomycin) were tested for synergistic activities against the microorganisms associated with otitis externa in dogs and for the solutions' stability over time. Synergistic activity was observed when EDTA-Tris plus amikacin and EDTA-Tris plus neomycin were tested against Staphylococcus intermedius, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, but not against Candida albicans. Stability studies over a 3-month period indicated that the test solutions were stable at room temperature and that their antimicrobial activity was maintained.
TI  - Study of the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of chronic otitis.
AB  - Over a period of 18 months 76 patients presenting with acute exacerbations of chronic otitis were enrolled in this study. The mean age of the patients was 46.4 +/- 16.8 years, the interval between the onset of symptoms of otitis and enrollment in the study was 22.1 +/- 19.4 years and the infective episode had been developing for 36.4 +/- 72.4 days. The patients received either 500 or 750 mg ciprofloxacin twice daily for a period of 9 days with no topical antibiotic treatment. The bacteriological specimen taken at enrollment was positive in 93% of the patients and led to the isolation of 85 microorganisms, 65% of which were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Proteus mirabilis. At the end of the treatment period, discharge from the ears (the primary clinical evaluation criterion) had ceased in 44/69 (64%) patients examined. The clinical cure rate was 23/39 (59%) for patients treated with 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice daily and 21/30 (70%) for those treated with 750 mg twice daily (difference was not statistically significant). At the end of a 4-week post-treatment follow-up, the clinical relapse rate was 7%. There was no relapse in the patients with chronic otitis which had been bacteriologically documented. Eight adverse effects were observed in five patients and treatment had to be discontinued in one case. This study shows ciprofloxacin to be an effective and safe agent for use in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic otitis treated in general practice. In certain cases, however, additional treatment with a topical antibiotic may be desirable.
TI  - [Staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. Bacteriologic aspects].
AB  - Struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. Ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. Incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. This trial examines the bacteriologic aspects pre and post-ESWL. Eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (UTI) were submitted to urine cultures pre and post-ESWL. The first 50 patients underwent during and post-ESWL, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of generalized sepsis. No patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. With respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-ESWL UTI, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a UTI post-ESWL. The distribution of organisms pre and post-ESWL was as follows: Proteus mirabilis (22/22), Escherichia coli (11/11), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), Enterobacter cloacae (0/1), Alcaligenes odorans (1/2) Enterococcus faecalis (1/3), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and Candida albicans (1/1). In this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-ESWL probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. According to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. In 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial infection.

TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of cefepime: a multicentre study.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated in vitro against 1757 recent clinical Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates. Cefepime was active at low concentrations (MIC50 values < or = 0.06 mg/L and MIC90 values < or = 0.12 mg/L) against non-cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.). For Klebsiella pneumoniae, MICs were between 0.016 and 16 mg/L; the highest MIC values were observed for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Against Enterobacteriaceae, such as cephalosporinase producing Enterobacter cloacae, MICs were < or = 0.5 mg/L, but MICs against cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains were generally higher. Ticarcillin-sensitive strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by cefepime concentrations of 0.5-16 mg/L, while cefepime MICs were 8-64 mg/L for strains resistant to ticarcillin. The cefepime MIC50 value for Haemophilus spp. including many resistant to amoxycillin, was 0.03 mg/L. Against methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus, cefepime MICs were 0.5-16 mg/L; MICs against methicillin-resistant staphylococci were 16- > 128 mg/L). Against methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, cefepime MIC values were 0.03-16 mg/L; corresponding values for methicillin-resistant strains were 2-128 mg/L. Streptococci (Groups A, C and G) were sensitive to cefepime with MICs ranging from < or = 0.008-2 mg/L (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L; MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). The activity of cefepime against Group B streptococci and pneumococci were comparable, with MIC50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively, and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Most enterococci and all Listeria monocytogenes strains had MICs > or = 32 mg/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the Pseudomonas putida protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase genes.
AB  - The genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-PCD [EC 1.13.11.3]) were cloned from a Pseudomonas putida (formerly P. aeruginosa) (ATCC 23975) genomic library prepared in lambda phage. Plaques were screened by hybridization with degenerate oligonucleotides designed using known amino acid sequences. A 1.5-kb SmaI fragment from a 15-kb primary clone was subcloned, sequenced, and shown to contain two successive open reading frames, designated pcaH and pcaG, corresponding to the beta and alpha subunits, respectively, of 3,4-PCD. The amino acid sequences deduced from pcaHG matched the chemically determined sequence of 3,4-PCD in all except three positions. Cloning of pcaHG into broad-host-range expression vector pKMY319 allowed high levels of expression in P. putida strains, as well as in Proteus mirabilis after specific induction of the plasmid-encoded nahG promoter with salicylate. The recombinant enzyme was purified and crystallized from P. mirabilis, which lacks an endogenous 3,4-PCD. The physical, spectroscopic, and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, the same transient enzyme intermediates were formed during the catalytic cycle. These studies establish the methodology which will allow mechanistic investigations to be pursued through site-directed mutagenesis of P. putida 3,4-PCD, the only aromatic ring-cleaving dioxygenase for which the three-dimensional structure is known.
TI  - Iontophoresis and chloride-containing compounds: parameters required for killing.
AB  - Fungi, and gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were susceptible to iontophoretic killing in simple media. Iontophoresis did not depend on electrode type but did require chloride-containing compounds in the medium. All organisms could be killed efficiently if chloride-containing compounds (for example sodium chloride and calcium chloride) were present in physiological concentrations. Effectiveness of iontophoretic killing could be reduced by nonphysiologically elevated concentrations of other substances (for example creatinine and albumin). The data suggest that iontophoresis should function well in urine, since chloride-containing compounds are present in adequate concentrations even if some naturally occurring compounds, such as creatinine or albumin, are elevated.
TI  - Blockage of urethral catheters by bacterial biofilms.
AB  - We report the case of a 63-year-old woman whose indwelling urethral catheter became blocked regularly at 4-5 day intervals over a period of 10 weeks. 'Worm-like' structures 25-30 cm in length were found either in the catheter, completely occluding the lumen, or in the drainage tube thereby blocking the valve of the drainage bag. Electron microscopy showed that these structures were composed of bacteria, while culture revealed them to be mixed communities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Proteus mirabilis. Following treatment with ciprofloxacin, catheter drainage continued freely for a further period of 10 weeks.
TI  - The ureter in vitro: normal motility and response to urinary pathogens.
AB  - The effects of bacteria on in vitro ureteric contractility were studied, using a  model which allowed selective exposure of organisms to the ureteric mucosa and smooth muscle, respectively. A cannula attached to a pressure transducer was ligated into the proximal lumen of 2.5-cm segments of canine ureter. The distal ureter was ligated to form a closed pressure monitored system, and the segment suspended in a 20-ml organ bath containing Krebs Henseleit buffer at physiological pH and temperature. Following onset of spontaneous activity, broths of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were added to either the buffer solution or ureteric lumen in doses of > 10(6) organisms/ml. Experiments were repeated using heat-killed organisms, bacterial filtrates and E. coli endotoxin. Ureteric contractility was stimulated by organisms added to the buffer medium, but reversibly inhibited by bacteria placed in the ureteric lumen. Heat-killed organisms, endotoxin and live filtrates had no effect on normal motility when exposed to either the ureteric mucosa or muscularis respectively. These findings reflect the conflicting changes in ureteric motility seen in vivo when bacteria are administered systemically or directly into the ureteric lumen.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of two different dosage regimens of imipenem in an in-vitro dynamic model.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of imipenem was tested in an in-vitro model mimicking  human serum pharmacokinetics after either 1000 mg im once daily or 500 mg im twice daily. Six recent clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella group B were used as test strains. Our results suggest that a single daily dose of imipenem 1000 mg im exerts an antibacterial action comparable to that obtained with two divided doses of 500 mg.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of isoxazolyl++ naphthoquinones. I].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of 2-hydroxy-N-(3,4-dimethyl-5-isoxazolyl) 1,4 naphthoquinone-4-imine (I) and three of this derivatives against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis y Morganella morganii was investigated. From the four naphthoquinone-imine studied, compound I exhibited activity against S. aureus. This effect was observed even in oxygen atmosphere with 5% CO2 and in the presence of human albumin. The development of drug-resistant strains by serial passage in media with concentrations lower than the C.I.M. was determined in 31 strains of S. aureus from clinical material and one from collection. No significant differences in C.I.M. were observed.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - The penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  - We examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. Ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. We obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. These vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as the MIC70 of S. aureus and Bacillus cereus. Therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial activity of the aminothiazolyl cephalosporin RU 29,246.
AB  - A total of 1,007 clinical isolates from a tertiary care center were tested against RU 29,246, ampicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, Augmentin, oxacillin, piperacillin, gentamicin, amikacin and vancomycin. Bacteria tested consisted of 479 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, 64 pseudomonads, 18 Xanthomonas, 42 other gram-negative bacilli, 56 enterococci and 348 isolates of staphylococci. RU 29,246 showed excellent in vitro activity inhibiting > 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia, Morganella, Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas hydrophila, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus at an MIC of 0.5-1.0 mg/l. Seventy-seven percent coagulase-negative staphylococci had an MIC of 1.0-4.0 mg/l. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and X. maltophilia were resistant to RU 29,246. Fifty-six percent of the enterococcal isolates were inhibited by 1.0-16.0 mg/l of RU 29,246.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - Biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase I. Its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total of 650 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). Biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei and Yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of Serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. Biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [A clinical study on upper urinary tract calculi treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) monotherapy, with regard to bacteriuria before ESWL treatment].
AB  - To study a clinical problem in urolithiasis complicated with bacteriuria treated  by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), we studied relationships between the frequency of bacteriuria and some clinical factors such as sex, location of, size of and composition of calculi in patients with upper urinary tract calculi. We also evaluated whether bacteriuria caused fever elevation after ESWL monotherapy. Six hundred seventy patients with upper urinary tract calculi, 440 renal calculi and 230 ureteral calculi, were subjected to the present study. The results were summarized as follows: 1) Bacteriuria was found in 40 of 440 patients with renal calculi (9%) and 12 of 230 patients with ureteral calculi (5%). 2) The frequency of bacteriuria was significantly higher in female (11%) than in male (6%) (p < 0.05). 3) Ten strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7 of Escherichia coli and 6 of Proteus mirabilis were isolated in patients with bacteriuria. 4) On the location of renal calculi in patients with bacteriuria, 37 out of 40 patients (93%) were found in R2. In contrast, bacteriuria was the most frequently found in DS 6 (19%), whereas the positive rates were about 10% in DS 3 (7%), DS 4 (*7%) and DS 5 (9%). The presence of bacteriuria was not related to the location of calculi or the size of calculi in patients with ureteral calculi. 5) Most of the calculi with bacteriuria were composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate or the mixture of calcium phosphate and carbonate with or without oxalate. 6) Patients with bacteriuria had a significantly higher rate of fever elevation after ESWL than those without bacteriuria (p < 0.01).
TI  - [An urease enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection].
AB  - A sensitive and specific serological diagnostic test for Helicobacter pylori infection has been developed and validated in 120 patients with dyspeptic symptoms undergoing endoscopy. This test is to use urease, a protein unique to H. pylori, as the basis for the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects serum H. pylori urease antibodies. The ELISA mean optical density (OD) in H. pylori-positive group is higher than that in H. pylori-negative group (0.57 +/- 0.23 vs 0.24 +/- 0.15, P < 0.001), a cut-off 0.3 OD yields a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 93%. Serum absorption test showed that Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolotica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell lysate do not influence serum H. pylori urease antibody level, though they all have urease except E. coli. The result implied that H. pylori urease can be a good antigen to detect serum H. pylori antibody and it would be useful for epidemiological survey and routine diagnostic approach. Nearly half of the blood donors showed positive result with H. pylori urease antibody. It is suggested that H. pylori infection is quite common in the asymptomatic population.
TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Bacteria in Er(III) Solution by Thin-Film Magnetopheresis.
AB  - Magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, Er, was evaluated. The magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. The optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with Escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM ErCl(3) solution. Three gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. Quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. Qualitative analysis consisted of Gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. The magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of E. coli down to the concentration of 10 CFU ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. Er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the Gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. Indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. On average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of Er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. The thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.
TI  - Effect of a human IgG preparation rich in antibodies to a wide range of lipopolysaccharides on gram-negative bacterial sepsis in burned mice.
AB  - A human intravenous IgG preparation (Anti-LPS IgG) rich in antibodies to different lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and a normal human intravenous IgG (NIgG) were investigated for their ability to confer passive immunity. Both preparations were given at the time of infection (prophylaxis) or during sepsis (therapy) to burned mice with lethal infection induced by various clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria. When given at the time of infection both IgG preparations (5 mg/mouse) inhibited lethality induced by some bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa serogroup G and B), but not others (Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis), indicating a protection by by strain-specific antibodies. However, no significant protection was seen when mice were treated during sepsis. The range of specific antibody titers to the whole live bacteria and heat-killed (LPS-preserved) bacteria in the NIgG paralleled that of Anti-LPS IgG; however, the magnitude of the antibody titers did not accurately reflect the protective capacity in vivo. Thus, the exact specificity of the protective antibodies is still unknown. The protective effect of both IgG preparations was dose-dependent; at low IgG doses (0.5 mg/mouse) better protection was obtained with Anti-LPS IgG, whilst at higher doses (> or = 1 mg/mouse) both preparations exhibited identical effects. Low doses of either IgG preparation in combination with subtherapeutic doses of piperacillin significantly enhanced early survival (day 2 for NIgG and day 2 + 3 for Anti-LPS IgG) against P. aeruginosa, but the protective effect waned thereafter. We conclude that a strain-specific antibacterial effect in a compromised mouse infection model can be obtained by early passive immunization with human IgG from large plasma pools. It is suggested that Anti-LPS IgG or NIgG may be of benefit in some cases of gram-negative sepsis when administered as prophylaxis together with proper antibiotic treatment.
TI  - New heterocyclic structures. thiazolo[3,2-a][1,2,5] thiadiazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine  and [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3',4':4,5] pyrimido[2,1-b][1,3]thiazine. biological assays.
AB  - 6,7-Dihydro-9H-thiazolo[3,2-a][1,2,5]thiadiazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidin-9-one, 7,8-dihydro-6H,10H-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3',4':4,5]pyrimido [2,1-b][1,3]thiazin-10-one and its 3-methyl derivative were prepared by reacting 6,7-diamino-2,3-dihydro-5H-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-5-one, 7,8-diamino-3,4-dihydro-2H,6H-pyrimido[2,1-b][1,3]thiazin-6-one or its 3-methyl derivative with N-thionylaniline. A reaction mechanism is proposed. The compounds and the sodium salts of (7-amino-2,3-dihydro-5H-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-5-on-6-yl)sulfamic acid, (8-amino-3,4-dihydro-2H,6H-pyrimido[2,1-b][1,3]thiazin-6-on-7-yl) sulfamic acid and its 3-methyl derivative were tested for antimicrobial and antimycotic activity on a number of strains, namely: E. Coli, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp, Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans, and for antiviral activity on Herpes simplex virus type 1 and Vescicular stomatitis virus. None of the compounds showed antiviral activity or exhibited biological activity against gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria or against mycetes.
TI  - [Phage and serological types of bacteria infecting patients in anesthesiology and intensive therapy (1988-1990)].
AB  - 1736 of biological materials, being taken from 264 patients, were investigated since 1988 to 1990. 1410 kinds of microorganisms were cultured from 999 biological materials, in which the growth of bacterial flora was noticed. Following species were isolated most frequently: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15.39%, Proteus mirabilis 12.91%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10.43% and Staphylococcus aureus 10.43%. The most frequent serological type according to Fisher's scheme was Pseudomonas aeruginosa--immunotype T 3.7 and according to Habs scheme--immunotype P 16. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently sensitive to phages the group II. In case of Klebsiella sp. bacilli, the most predominant strains were not typed either by basic or extended phage sets.
TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot.
AB  - Immunological characterization of various Pseudomonas pseudomallei preparations was carried out by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using sera from infected humans and from patients with other bacterial infections. Somatic (SOM) and partially purified cell extracts (PCE) gave more complex SDS-PAGE patterns: M(r) ranged from 86 to 12.7 and 48 to 10 kDa, respectively. The culture-filtrated antigens (CF) from 3 different kinds of synthetic media consisted of fairly simple profiles with common bands M(r) of 40, 26 and 16 kDa. PCE and CF reacted specifically with infected human sera; SOM did not. The components with M(r) of 40 kDa in CF reacted consistently with all infected sera but failed to react with sera infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. stutzeri. This peptide was demonstrated to be a major component in CF thus suggesting its potential for development of immunodiagnostic methods for melioidosis.
TI  - Effectiveness and safety of ofloxacin in chronic otitis media and chronic sinusitis in adult outpatients.
AB  - A multicentric study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of ofloxacin in the treatment of chronic sinusitis and chronic otitis (CSOM) in outpatients. Two hundred milligrams of ofloxacin was administered twice a day orally for 12 days in 198 patients with chronic sinusitis and 215 patients with CSOM. Cultures for bacteriology were carried out before treatment. The spectrum of pathogens sensitive to ofloxacin included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae. Higher concentrations of ofloxacin were obtained at sites of infection than in serum. Favorable results were achieved clinically in 93.7% of chronic sinusitis cases and 93.9% of CSOM cases. Adverse effects occurred in only 4.1% of cases. These results support the use of ofloxacin as the drug of first choice in the treatment of chronic sinusitis and CSOM in adult outpatients.
TI  - [Nose and throat carriage in "food handlers"].
AB  - From December 1991 to February 1992, 450 personnel have been investigated for pathogen microorganisms in their nose and throat. The study was performed in the Infectious Diseases Section of Gulhane Military Medical Academy. Pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from 54 nose culture (12%) and 6 throat culture (1.33%). In one person pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from his nose and throat. The difference between the two groups (The nose and throat cultures) was significant at p = 0.001 by Fisher's exact test (t = 6.414). In the nose cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (85.2%), Proteus vulgaris (5.6%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.8%), Citrobacter freundii (1.8%), Group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus (1.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.8%). Only one (1.85%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus vulgaris) in his nasal culture. In the throat cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (66.7%) and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (50%). Only one (16.6%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) in his throat culture. The same pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus) has been isolated in an only one person's nasal and throat cultures (0.22%). We treated 60 personnel who were nasal and throat carriers according to the results of antibiograms. After treatment, two still had previous pathogen microorganism (Staphylococcus aureus). These two carriers were eradicated by repeating the treatment.
TI  - [Bacteriologic examinations of patients with burns].
AB  - Bacteriological studies were performed on 189 patients treated during 1985-1989.  800 samples were tested which were taken from various sites of burn wound (3-5 smears from a patient). Surface of burn amounted to 15-86% and degree of burn was IIb/III. In 772 samples, 2073 bacterial strains were found. Most frequent were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31%) and Staphylococcus aureus (29%). Remaining strains consisted chiefly of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Serological typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa carried according to Fisher demonstrated dominance of immunotype T3.7 (43%). Staphylococcal strains were most frequently sensitive to group III phages and/or supplementary phages.
TI  - [Etiologic bacterial factors of infections in patients treated at the clinical anesthesiology ward and with intensive therapy].
AB  - Bacteriological investigations were carried on 264 patients treated in 1988-1990. 1736 samples of biological materials were taken and it amounts to 6-7 samples from each patient. Most frequently isolated microorganisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15%), Proteus mirabilis (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%) and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). Serological typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed according to Habs and domination of immunotype P16 (30%) was detected. Majority of isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae were not typable with basic and broadened phage set. One strain was susceptible to phages KI12 and KI27. This phage type was not isolated in Poland before. Staphylococci were most frequently susceptible to group II phages (29%), additional phages (19%) and 15% were not typable with the phage set used. Isolated bacteria were in majority resistant to numerous antibiotics.
TI  - Microwave sterilization of enterobacteria.
AB  - A new method is described which makes it possible to treat metal materials with microwaves. In consequence scalpel blades as well as cover glasses contaminated with four species of bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were sterilized. With this method sterilization can be achieved quite rapidly (1.5-2 min). Scanning electron microscopy revealed a progressive alteration in the morphology of micro-organisms and this proved proportional to the microwave exposure time. Only in Proteus mirabilis were no modifications found, even after long periods of microwave exposure.
TI  - Potentiation of the in vitro activity of some antimicrobial agents against selected gram-negative bacteria by EDTA-tromethamine.
AB  - The in vitro synergistic effects of combinations of EDTA-tromethamine and six antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, nalidixic acid and sulphadimethoxine) on clinically isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli were investigated. The antibacterial activity was assessed from the minimal inhibitory concentration for the antibiotics alone or in combination with EDTA-tromethamine. EDTA-tromethamine potentiated the antibacterial activity of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline and streptomycin up to four-fold. There were no significant or consistent synergistic effects with nalidixic acid or sulphadimethoxine.
TI  - Proteus mirabilis urease: transcriptional regulation by UreR.
AB  - Proteus mirabilis urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, initiating the formation of urinary stones. The enzyme is critical for kidney colonization and the development of acute pyelonephritis. Urease is induced by urea and is not controlled by the nitrogen regulatory system (ntr) or catabolite repression. Purified whole-cell RNA from induced and uninduced cultures of P. mirabilis and Escherichia coli harboring cloned urease sequences was probed with a 4.2-kb BglI fragment from within the urease operon. Autoradiographs of slot blots demonstrated 4.2- and 5.8-fold increases, respectively, in urease-specific RNA upon induction with urea. Structural and accessory genes necessary for urease activity, ureD, A, B, C, E, and F, were previously cloned and sequenced (B. D. Jones and H. L. T. Mobley, J. Bacteriol. 171:6414-6422, 1989). A 1.2-kb EcoRV-BamHI restriction fragment upstream of these sequences confers inducibility upon the operon in trans. Nucleotide sequencing of this fragment revealed a single open reading frame of 882 nucleotides, designated ureR, which is transcribed in the direction opposite that of the urease structural and accessory genes and encodes a 293-amino-acid polypeptide predicted to be 33,415 Da in size. Autoradiographs of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of [35S]methionine-labeled polypeptides obtained by in vitro transcription-translation of the PCR fragments carrying only ureR yielded a single band with an apparent molecular size of 32 kDa. Fragments carrying an in-frame deletion within ureR synthesized a truncated product. The predicted UreR amino acid sequence contains a potential helix-turn-helix motif and an associated AraC family signature and is similar to that predicted for a number of DNA-binding proteins, including E. coli proteins that regulate acid phosphatase synthesis (AppY), porin synthesis (EnvY), and rhamnose utilization (RhaR). These data suggest that UreR governs the inducibility of P. mirabilis urease.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - Identification of gram-negative bacteria by isoelectric focusing of soluble cellular proteins.
AB  - Strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, isolated from clinical specimens were disrupted by repeated freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature. The samples were separated by isoelectric focusing using polyacrylamide gels. The resulting protein patterns showed clear differences between the three species and made identification possible.
TI  - Survey of the prevalence of beta-lactamases amongst 1000 gram-negative bacilli isolated consecutively at the Royal London Hospital.
AB  - beta-Lactamase expression was examined in 1000 consecutive Gram-negative bacilli  isolated from urine, wound swab, sputum or blood specimens received at the Microbiology Laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. This survey, performed between January and April, 1991, followed a similar study undertaken in early 1982. The distribution of species was similar in the two surveys, except that the proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates had increased from 11% in 1982 to 17.5% in the present study. This increase was balanced by a decreased proportion of enterobacteria. Amongst plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, TEM-1 (especially), TEM-2, SHV-1 and OXA types continued to predominate in enterobacteria. Their frequency in Escherichia coli was unchanged (46% in 1991 compared with 43% in 1982), but had increased from 5 to 22% amongst Proteus mirabilis isolates. An apparent decrease in their frequency amongst Enterobacter cloacae isolates, from 48% in 1982 to 17% in 1991, probably reflected changes to strain prevalence rather than enzyme prevalence. Plasmid type beta-lactamases were present in fewer than 2% of P. aeruginosa isolates in both surveys. In the present study, chromosomal beta-lactamase derepression (constitutive hyperproduction) was detected in 10/76 isolates of E. cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia spp. and Morganella morganii, and in 2/170 P. aeruginosa isolates. These proportions were increased, compared with those seen the 1982 survey, though the significance was borderline (P approximately 0.05; chi 2 test). Extended-spectrum plasmid mediated beta-lactamases, unknown in 1982, were found in 11/70 Klebsiellae pneumoniae isolates in the present study. Ten of these organisms, representing at least five distinct strains, produced TEM-10 enzyme, encoded by a plasmid of c. 90 kb; the remaining organism had an unidentified SHV-derived enzyme.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of new heterocyclic structures: [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c] [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo [4', 5': 4,5] pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine.
AB  - Some derivatives of thiazolo[3,2-c]pyrimidine, pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine, thiazolo[2,3-i]purine, [1,3]thiazino[2,3-i]purine, thiazolo[3,2-c][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-e]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4',5':4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b][1,3]thiazine were prepared. The compounds were tested for antimicrobial and antimycotic activity on a number of strains, namely, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans, Aspergillus sp., and for antiviral activity on Herpes simplex virus, Type 1 (HSV-1), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Coxsackievirus B5 (CoxB5). The compounds proved to be devoid of activity against viruses, mycetes and gram-negative bacteria, while some of them exhibited a modest activity against gram-positive bacterial strains.
TI  - Pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility profiles in the urinary tract.
AB  - Of 2,780 specimens of midstream urine (MSU) collected from patients of Medical out-patient Unit of Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), and examined between March 1989 and February 1990, 780 (28.1%) had bacterial colony counts greater than 100,000 per ml. The commonest pathogens were E. coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 9.8% of the infections were caused by Gram-positive bacteria while 6.0% were due to the fungus, Candida albicans and Candida species.
TI  - A descriptive analysis of urine cultures: pure versus mixed isolates.
AB  - Out of 5,670 urine cultures performed in 1989, 1,448 positive cultures with unique results were analyzed. Of these 1,448, 67% were pure cultures, and 50% had at least one isolate with a colony count greater than 100,000 colony forming units/ml. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were more likely (p < 0.01) to occur in mixed than pure culture, while Escherichia coli was more likely to occur in pure than mixed culture. The most common organism combinations were diphtheroids-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (30 cultures), E. faecalis-coagulase negative Staphylococcus (28), E. faecalis-P. aeruginosa (13), K. pneumoniae-P. aeruginosa (9), and E. coli-P. aeruginosa (9).
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1988). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - Isolation frequencies and sensitivities to antibacterial and antibiotic agents were investigated on 801 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 9 hospitals during the period of June to November 1988. Of the above total bacterial population, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus spp. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.7% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis: Vancomycin was most active with its MIC90 < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. Ampicillin, piperacillin, ofloxacin (OFLX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and imipenem (IPM) were also active. 2. Staphylococcus aureus: Arbekacin and minocycline were most active with their MIC90s 0.39 microgram/ml and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Among penicillins, dicloxacillin was the most active. Activities of cephems were considerably lower. 3. E. coli: Most of the agents were tested active. Particularly the second and third generation cephems were active in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. Carumonam (CRMN), IPM, OFLX and CPFX were also active with MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml. 4. Klebsiella pneumoniae CRMN and IPM were highly active. Penicillins generally showed lower activities. Cephems and new quinolones had high activities with their MIC90s in a range of 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. 5. Proteus mirabilis: The third generation cephems were active with their MIC90s in a range of < or = 0.10-0.20 microgram/ml. CRMN, OFLX and CPFX were also active with their MIC90s < or = 0.10 microgram/ml, 0.39 microgram/ml and 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. 6. Pseudomonas aeruginosa: IPM and tobramycin were active with their MIC90s 1.56 micrograms/ml and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. CRMN and new quinolones showed MIC80s of 25-100 micrograms/ml. Most of penicillins and cephems were not active. 7. Other Gram-negative rods: Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, IPM, CPFX and OFLX were active. Penicillins and cephems were not so active. CRMN was active against S. marcescens with its MIC80 at 6.25 micrograms/ml.
TI  - A novel electrical method for the prevention of microbial colonization of intravascular cannulae.
AB  - An electrical device designed to prevent microbial attachment to plastic intravascular cannulae is described. The device produced an electrical current (10 microA) in both carbon-impregnated and 'Hydrocath' cannulae. In-vitro models were utilized to demonstrate that the current can block several mechanisms by which microorganisms gain initial access to intravascular devices, including extra- and intra-luminal routes. The electrical system prevented organisms from traversing along both the external and internal surfaces of the cannulae. Effective prevention of cannula colonization was demonstrated subsequent to challenge with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The findings suggest that the electrical device may offer in-vivo cannula protection from microbial attachment and colonization, thereby reducing the potential for infection.
TI  - Nonspecific reactions of a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (TECRA) for detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins in foods.
AB  - A staphylococcal enterotoxin visual immunoassay kit (TECRA) has recently become commercially available. Since the kit is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system equipped with polyvalent antisera against staphylococcal enterotoxin types A to E (SEA to SEE) and the test is simple and rapid to perform (4 h), it has been widely used for screening purposes. In this study, the sensitivity of the kit for detection of SEA, SEB, and SEC in ham, cheese, and mushrooms was similar to those of kits based on an enzyme immunoassay and reversed passive latex agglutination: 0.75 to 1.0 ng of SEA per ml, 0.5 to 0.75 ng of SEB per ml, and 1.0 to 1.25 ng of SEC per ml. However, the TECRA kit showed nonspecific reactions with food samples contaminated by microorganisms other than Staphylococcus aureus, such as Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. The substance contributing to the false-positive results differed from true staphylococcal enterotoxins in that it was (i) heat labile (completely inactivated by heating for 2 min at 100 degrees C, whereas true staphylococcal enterotoxins were inactivated by about 10% with this treatment), (ii) lower in molecular weight than staphylococcal enterotoxins, and (iii) not bound to a copper chelate Sepharose gel (all of the substance remained in the unbound wash fraction, whereas staphylococcal enterotoxins were quantitatively bound to the gel). The problem of false-positive results with the TECRA kit could be resolved by heat treatment (2 min at 100 degrees C) or by cleanup procedures involving metal chelate affinity chromatography with copper chelate Sepharose for 4 h before use of the TECRA kit.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - To investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (SISO), MICs of SISO as well as other aminoglycosides (AGs) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. Results are summarized below: 1. No SISO-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii. 2. In comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was higher, and SISO-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the MRSA. Also, SISO-resistant strains of Serratia marcescens increased. However, the rate of SISO-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris, SISO-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. MICs of SISO against Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of SISO was weak against genus Providencia. 4. For comparison, according to MICs of ofloxacin and imipenem, new quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. 5. SISO is still one of the useful AGs in the 1990's since it maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.
TI  - Urinary tract infection in acute spinal cord injury.
AB  - Preservation of renal function and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections is the ultimate goal of any method of neurogenic bladder management in spinal cord injury patients. METHOD--The hospital courses of fifty such patients admitted to our Rehabilitation Department from August 1989 to August 1990 were studied according to age, gender, spinal cord injury level, method of bladder drainage on admission and upon discharge, type of urinary tract infections and results of bladder management were documented. RESULTS--Forty-five men and ten women were studied. Mean age of males was forty and females, forty-two. The commonest cause of injury was road traffic accident followed by accidents at work place. Fifty-three percent had cervical cord injuries, thirteen percent thoracolumbar and sixteen percent lumbo sacral injuries. Seventy-eight percent had an indwelling foley catheter upon admission. Upon discharge eighty-two percent of spinal cord injury patients were able to void with/without tapping and compression. There were a total of one hundred and forty-three urinary tract infections in our study group. All positive urine cultures had greater than or equal to 100,000 CFU/ml. The commonest organisms causing urinary tract infection were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION--For bacteria to produce disease in the urinary tract, they must gain access and colonise the uroepithelium, induce inflammation and tissue damage. The indwelling catheter provides a direct access to the uroepithelium, making bacteriuria and subsequent infection inevitable. Impaired voiding and sensation in spinal cord injury patients provides an excellent reservoir for the multiplication of bacteria, tissue invasion and recurrent urinary tract infection. Hence current methods of neurogenic bladder management have to focus on attaining a catheter-free status as soon as possible; relevant antibiotic therapy and careful attention to individual urinary tract problems to reduce morbidity and improve on spinal cord injury patient's future. Although spinal cord injury patients are described, the material covered is applicable to any type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of ticarcillin alone and ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid against beta-lactamase producing and non-producing microorganisms.
AB  - A total of 818 clinical bacterial isolates were tested for the production of beta-lactamase by rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method and for the susceptibility to ticarcillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid (2 micrograms/mL) by agar dilution method. These included 83 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 31 of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 49 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 58 of Haemophilus influenzae, 112 of Escherichia coli, 118 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 58 of Proteus mirabilis, 30 of Proteus vulgaris, 60 of Serratia marcescens, 113 of Enterobacter cloacae, 60 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 46 of Bacteroides fragilis. The results revealed that 46.6% of P. mirabilis, 53.4% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of N. gonorrhoeae, 80% of P. vulgaris, 83.9% of MRSA, 85.6% of MSSA, 87.5% of E. coli, 91.7% of S. marcescens, 95.7% of B. fragilis, 98.2% of E. cloacae, and 100% of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa strains produced beta-lactamase. In general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to ticarcillin than beta-lactamase producers. The ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ticarcillin for beta-lactamase nonproducers of MSSA, MRSA, H. influenzae, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, E. cloacae, B. fragilis and beta-lactamase producers of MSSA, H. influenzae strains were all within the in vitro susceptible range. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the antibacterial activity of ticarcillin against beta-lactamase producers of MRSA, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris and B. fragilis strains. Clavulanic acid had no synergistic activity for ticarcillin against S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae.
TI  - Evaluation of the usefulness of a novel injectable cephalosporin, E1040, and ceftazidime for management of complicated urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis by using the rat urolithiasis model.
AB  - A novel injectable cephalosporin, E1040, significantly eradicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the urine, in contrast to ceftazidime, in rats with complicated P. aeruginosa urinary tract infections associated with urinary stones, suggesting that E1040 is a prospective therapeutic agent in the management of refractory Pseudomonas urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Effect of pH on preferential antibacterial-activity of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)].
AB  - Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a chelating agent, was examined for the antibacterial activity against 15 species of bacteria by treating with a 10mM solution at pH adjusted to 5.0, 7.0 or 9.0. All bacterial species tested were classified into three groups; tentatively named the pH5 EDTA-sensitive group comprising Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus, the pH9 EDTA-sensitive group comprising Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the EDTA-nonsensitive group comprising Proteus mirabilis. The EDTA-sensitivity grouping may be used as a tool for preferential decontamination of certain bacteria in live edible fishes, although further experiments are needed to characterize more strains and also species of bacteria.
TI  - Onychia of a macronychia in congenital aphalangia.
AB  
TI  - Effects of cefaclor, cefetamet and Ro 40-6890 on inflammatory responses of human  granulocytes.
AB  - The effect of three cephalosporins (cefetamet, cefaclor and Ro 40-6890) upon human granulocytes and their ability to modulate the chemiluminescence response, phagocytose, kill bacteria and generate leukotrienes was studied. In the presence of the cephalosporins there was a significant increase in phagocytosis of Escherichia coli. The bactericidal activity of human granulocytes for several other bacteria was also enhanced. Cefetamet and cefaclor increased the chemiluminescence response of human neutrophils to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis in contrast to Ro 40-68790, which decreased the chemiluminescence response. The cephalosporins decreased the synthesis of leukotrienes from human neutrophils after stimulation with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. These data emphasize the immunomodulatory functions of various cephalosporins on cells involved in host defence.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - Evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in a university hospital in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of aztreonam were evaluated in an open trial at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 45 critically-ill adult patients were enrolled in the study. All patients with documented Gram-negative infection were treated with aztreonam as monotherapy. Antibiotics active against only Gram-positive and/or anaerobic organisms were allowed. Twenty cases were clinically evaluable. Eleven had lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia), 3 had urinary tract infections, and 6 had septicemia. Clinical signs and symptoms, cultures and other laboratory profiles were assessed prior to treatment, at 4-6 days during treatment and within 2-3 days of the end of therapy (usually 7-15 days). Nineteen out of 20 (95%) had a satisfactory clinical response. All cases with septicemia and urinary tract infections were microbiologically cured. The overall microbiological response rate was 90%. Fifty-five percent of all infections were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two patients with Gram-negative pneumonia due to P. aeruginosa did not respond microbiologically to aztreonam therapy. No serious adverse events requiring discontinuation of aztreonam therapy were reported. No mortality occurred.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate efficacy of amikacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of amikacin (AMK) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the AMK disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of AMK. Included in the study were a 3 category system of NCCLS, a 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the British Society for Antimicrobial chemotherapy. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of AMK against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobactor aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. The disc susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disc manual. Inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MIC values. The results of AMK disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with MICs, indicating that the disc method was reliable in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.807 to -0.897, P less than 0.01 in both instances). In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, the break points in MIC values of AMK proposed are (+3) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. In the 3 category classification system of NCCLS, the MIC break points proposed are defined sensitive (S) for MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (R) for MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. In this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Inhibition of motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis by subinhibitory concentrations of azithromycin.
AB  - Exposure to subinhibitory concentrations (4-8 micrograms/ml) of azithromycin resulted in loss of motility in Proteus mirabilis strains and a significant reduction of motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Examination revealed that the loss of motility was due to a total absence of flagella in Proteus mirabilis while the poor motility observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was due to absence of flagella in the majority of the population. Since motility may be considered a pathogenicity trait in the two species, these results confirm the unusual ability of azithromycin to reduce the expression of virulence factors in gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem (SM-7338) against major respiratory pathogens and amikacin-resistant nosocomial isolates.
AB  - Meropenem, a new broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, demonstrated excellent in  vitro activity against major respiratory pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of meropenem for Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae isolates were frequently less than those of imipenem. For nosocomial amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli, meropenem had eightfold lower MIC90 values compared to imipenem against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli; it was 32-fold more active than imipenem against Proteus mirabilis isolates. Activity was similar to that of imipenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Overall, meropenem showed excellent activity against common community-acquired pathogens as well as amikacin-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide Er(III) and a magnetic field.
AB  - A trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (Er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. Erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 Bohr magnetons, and following addition as ErCl3 (final concentration 5 mM) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the Quality Control Depository of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA as suspensions in 0.9% NaCl, in concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. Bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 T) and quantified by a light scattering method. The quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample pH (prior to ErCl3 addition), affinity to Gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The hydrophobicity of gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients with inflammatory and suppurative-destructive lung diseases].
AB  - Hydrophobic properties of 11 enterobacterial strains and 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from patient with inflammatory and purulent destructive diseases of the lungs were studied. The hydrophobic properties of the isolated bacteria were determined by the method of salting out with ammonium sulfate. A high correlation (r = 0.56) between the above-mentioned properties of gram-negative bacteria and their isolation rate from patients with destructive diseases was established. The hydrophobic properties of bacteria were supposed to be of importance in the process of the colonization of pulmonary tissues with bacterial flora.
TI  - The effect of repeated instillations of antiseptics on catheter-associated urinary tract infections: a study in a physical model of the catheterized bladder.
AB  - The activity of three antiseptic bladder washout solutions was examined in a physical model of the catheterized bladder. Tests were performed against cultures of four common urinary tract pathogens that had established themselves in the model and colonized the surfaces with biofilm. Double instillations of chlorhexidine (0.02% w/v) at 6-h intervals failed to eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Providencia stuartii from the bladder model. Escherichia coli, however, was susceptible to a second instillation provided that it was performed within 12 h. Supplementing chlorhexidine with EDTA and TRIS potentiated its activity against E. coli. Mandelic acid (1.0% w/v) was the most effective of the agents, double instillations eliminating all but Pr. mirabilis infections.
TI  - [The antibacterial immunity of people under dynamic observation in an altered radiation situation].
AB  - The comparative study of the isolation rate, level, antigenic and class specificity of serum antibodies to the causative agents of purulent septic infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and acute enteric infections in healthy adults with different ABO blood groups before (836 persons) and after (1,429 persons) the catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power station was made. The study revealed the fact that the genesis of antibodies directed against different microorganisms can be stimulated without additional antigenic challenge in the form of disease or immunization, which was definitely indicative of the influence of small radiation doses in Kiev on the humoral immunity of the population. The multifactor character of the dependence of antibacterial antibody formation under altered radiation conditions on the specific features of the infective agent and the intensity of its circulation among the population, individual immune responsiveness of the body and concrete radiation conditions was established.
TI  - Susceptibility of recent clinical isolates to temafloxacin (A-63004) and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of 1008 strains of recent clinical isolates was determined against the new aryl fluoroquinolone temafloxacin (T-167, A-63004) ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin, oxacillin and vancomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of temafloxacin in micrograms/ml required for > or = 90% isolates were 0.13-0.5 for enterobacter, 0.03-0.25 for Escherichia coli, 0.12-0.5 for Klebsiella, 0.5-1.0 for Proteus mirabilis, 0.12-0.5 for Morganella morganii, 0.03-0.12 for Salmonella, 0.25-1.0 for Serratia marcescens, 0.03-0.12 for Shigella, 0.06-4.0 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.06-0.12 for Aeromonas hydrophila, 0.12-0.5 for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.12-1.0 for coagulase negative staphylococci and 4.0-8.0 for enterococci. The antibacterial activity of temafloxacin was comparable or superior to other drugs tested against most organisms. However, Xanthomonas malthophilia was relatively more susceptible to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, and temafloxacin had significantly high antibacterial activity against enterococci as compared to other fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyrA.
AB  - Two plasmids containing the cloned Escherichia coli wild-type gyrA gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for DNA gyrase A-mediated quinolone resistance. The results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of Gram-negative species including E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The use of an arithmetical MIC series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening for the detection of altered gyrase A. The observations were consistent with the suggestion that DNA gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase A-mediated resistance can occur in all.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to pefloxacin and 14 antibiotics].
AB  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin against 782 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized patients (July-September 1991) in Wroclaw was compared with that of 14 antibiotics (4 aminoglycosides and 10 beta-lactamase). The most susceptible to pefloxacin were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (96.0%), Klebsiella (94.4%), Proteus mirabilis (93.8%) and Escherichia coli (92.7%). The least susceptible proved to be: nonfermentative Gram-negative rods (46.5%), and among them Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3% weakly sensitive, 0% sensitive strains). It was found that over 80% of Gram-negative rods were susceptible to pefloxacin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. The most active against staphylococci were netilmicin (92.6%), pefloxacin (89.4%) and amikacin (82.5%).
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Microbiological exploitation of cardiac glycosides and alkaloids from Garcinia kola, Borreria ocymoides, Kola nitida and Citrus aurantifolia.
AB  - The four medicinal plants, Garcinia kola (roots), Borreria ocymoides (leaves), Kola nitida (bark) and Citrus aurantifolia (roots) were screened for phytochemical components. They were found to contain tannins, phlobatannins, polyphenols, hydroxymethyl anthraquinones, glucides, saponins, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, flavanoids and reducing compounds. The aqueous and alcoholic extracts as well as alkaloids and cardiac glycosides of the medicinal plants were tested on various pathogenic bacteria. They were found to inhibit such organisms as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The usefulness of the phytochemical bases of these plants as potential sources of pharmaceutical drug preparation is discussed.
TI  - The penicillins.
AB  - The penicillin family of antibiotics remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. In general, these agents have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections caused by susceptible bacteria. The initial introduction of aqueous penicillin G for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an important pharmacologic landmark. The emergence of penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (for example, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin), in which an acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactam [corrected] ring. Subsequently, the aminopenicillins (such as ampicillin and amoxicillin) were developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. Their spectrum included Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella Salmonella, Listeria, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. The search for a penicillin with additional antimicrobial activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the development of the carboxypenicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and temocillin) and the ureidopenicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, and apalcillin). Finally, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an aminopenicillin or ticarcillin has further extended their antibacterial spectra. The development of an ideal penicillin that is rapidly bactericidal, nonsensitizing, nontoxic, bioavailable, resistant to beta-lactamase, and without inoculum effect and that has a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins remains the goal.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The immunogenicity of mono- and associated vaccines made from strains of opportunistic bacteria].
AB  - In experiments on white mice the immunogenic potency of two variants of combined  vaccines prepared from strains of opportunistic bacteria was compared with that of monovaccines used as the components of the combined vaccines. All the vaccines under study were found highly immunogenic. Decrease of monovaccine share in the combined vaccine did not reduce the immunogenic potency to any of the strains. An 8- to 16-fold increase in the level of specific antibodies in the colostric lactosera of cows immunized with combined vaccines was observed, and the survival rate of newborn calves increased 3- to 4-fold.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  - Tazobactam (YTR 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. A total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. Their susceptibilities to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. The percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. In general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). For the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the MICs of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Salmonella species and Bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in MIC50, MIC90 and the geometric mean of MIC. For Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs did not change after adding tazobactam. For other species, there was a moderate decrease in MICs. We conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - [An experimental study of a lactoglobulin preparation against opportunistic bacteria and salmonellae].
AB  - A preclinical study of seven batches of lactoglobulin, a new biological preparation against opportunistic bacteria and salmonellae, has been carried out. High antibacterial activity of the preparation with respect to the virulent forms of Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis has been established. The preparation has been shown to be safe and nontoxic. The 4-year term of its storage at a temperature of 6 degrees +/- 4 degrees C has been substantiated.
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - Bacteriology of community acquired urinary tract infection. Analysis of 1048 cases.
AB  - Urine samples from 1048 cases clinically suspected to have urinary tract infection were examined for bacteriological culture and antibiotic sensitivity. Of 1048 cultures, 530 (50.5%) were sterile, 163 (15.5%) showed the presence of nonpathogenic bacteria and 11 (1%) revealed nonsignificant bacteriuria with Escherichia coli. Significant bacteriuria (more than 10(5)/ml) was found in the remaining 344 (32.8%) cases. Escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen isolated from 170 (16.2%) samples; Klebsiella aerogenes was the next in order, found in 46 (4.3%) cases. Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated in 37 (3.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 29 (2.7%), Proteus mirabilis in 26 (2.4%), Streptococcus faecalis in 21 (2.0%), Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (1%) and Citrobacter freundii in 3 cases. Nalidixic acid was the most effective drug against gram negative organisms. Nitrofurantoin was the next antibiotic of choice, whereas cephalexin was the third drug in order of sensitivity. Ampicillin was the first drug of choice in infection with gram positive cocci, followed by nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, cephalexin and cephaloridine. The results of sensitivity tests emphasise the problem of multiple drug resistance in our community.
TI  - In vitro activity of the novel cephalosporin GR69153.
AB  - The in vitro activity of GR69153 was compared to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem and gentamicin against a total of 702 recent clinical isolates. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(8) cfu) were used throughout. GR69153 inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Citrobacter freundii (MIC90 16 mg/l), Morganella morganii (MIC90 128 mg/l) and Enterobacter spp. (MIC90 greater than 128 mg/l) were considerably more resistant to GR69153. GR69153 was four-fold more active than ceftazidime against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus but was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis group.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, E-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Ro 09-1428 inhibited group A streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for Staphylococcus aureus Ro 09-1428 had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and E-1040. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. The majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Providencia, Salmonella and Shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. For most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae Ro 09-1428 had higher MICs of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. Anaerobes, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes were resistant to Ro 09-1428. Ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, Staphylococcus aureus PC-1, Moraxella catarrhalis Bro-1, Enterobacter P-99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Sabath-Abraham or Klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-7 and TEM-9. Ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid pH.
TI  - [Diabetic foot infections: a preliminary report].
AB  - Foot infection is a common cause of hospitalization for diabetic patients. Our study aimed to analyze patients' age, sex, the primary sites of infection, presenting features, outcome, bacteriologic studies and their clinical significance in diabetic foot infections. The age of our diabetic patients with foot infections ranged from 43 to 82 years, with a mean of 62.5 years; fifty-two of them were males and twenty-eight were females. The male to female ratio was 1.9:1, but there was no statistically significant difference between the sexes (p greater than 0.05). The commonest age group was the seventh decade of life (47.5%), followed by the sixth decade (32.5%). The commonest primary site of infection was the toes (53.8%), followed by foot area other than toe (25%) and the leg area was the least frequent (21.2%). Cellulitis combined with other foot lesions presented in 78.8% of these patients, foot ulcers in 75% of them, gangrenous change in 68%, necrotizing cellulitis or fasciitis in 16.3%, abscess formation in 12.5% and osteomyelitis in 7.5%. The legs were amputated in 53 patients (66.3%), usually below the knee (in 47.5%). We found that patients with a long history of DM had statistically significantly higher rate of amputation (p less than 0.01) than patients with only a brief history. Bacterial cultures from the infected foot lesions yielded numerous organisms in 58.8% of cases and a single organism in 31.1% of cases. Proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated, followed by E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The commonest month of the onset of diabetic foot infection was January, followed by February.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of pyrimido[2,1-b][1,3]thiazine, [1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]purine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d][1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives and thiazole analogues.
AB  - Some series of thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine, pyrimido[2,1-b] [1,3]thiazine, thiazolo[3,2-a]purine, [1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]purine, thiazolo[3,2-a][1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine and [1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-d][1,3]thiazino[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivatives, variously functionalized, were prepared. The compounds were tested for antimicrobial and antimycotic activity on a number of strains, namely: E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus, S. faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Aspergillus sp., and for antiviral activity on Herpes simplex virus Type 1, Vesicular stomatitis virus and Coxsackievirus B5. The compounds proved to be devoid of activity against viruses and gram-negative bacteria, while some of them exhibited modest activity against gram-positive bacterial strains.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new oral cephalosporin, ceftibuten. Results of a multicenter study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ceftibuten (CBT) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,416 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (I) Naturally non beta-lactamase producing species: E. coli 0.12-0.5, Shigella 0.06-0.12 and Salmonella 0.03-0.12, P. mirabilis 0.16-0.03. (II) Chromosomal penicillinase producing species: K. pneumoniae 0.03-0.5 and K. oxytoca 0.03-0.06. (III) Chromosomal cephalosporin producing species: E. cloacae and C. freundii 1- greater than 128: S. marcescens 0.25-2; indole + Proteus 0.06-0.12. Activity of CBT was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains; however, CBT was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and its activity was variably reduced on broad spectrum beta-lactamases producing strains. CBT was inactive on P. aeruginosa (MIC greater than or equal to 32) and on A. baumannii (8- greater than 128). Haemophilus and Gonococci, regardless on beta-lactamase production status, were very susceptible to CBT (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.06-0.5 and 0.016-0.06); it is the same situation for Meningococci; B. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.03 to 2 (strains susceptible to penicillin G) and 0.12 to 16 (strains resistant to penicillin G). CBT was inactive on Staphylococci. Enterococci and Streptococci B were generally resistant; Streptococci A, C, G were inhibited by low concentrations: 0.06 to 1 (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.25-0.5), whereas MIC for other Streptococci 0.12 to 128 (MIC 50 and 90%: 8-128) and for Pneumococci were 0.25 to 16 (4-8). These antibacterial properties particularly against Enterobacteriaceae placed CBT in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.
TI  - Activity of some antiseptics against urinary tract pathogens growing as biofilms  on silicone surfaces.
AB  - The activity of chlorhexidine, mandelic acid and a mandelic/lactic mixture were tested against biofilms of four species of gram-negative nosocomial organisms that commonly infect the catheterized urinary tract. Cells growing on silicone discs were exposed to concentrations of agents used in bladder instillation. Citrobacter diversus biofilms proved to be sensitive to all three agents. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae all survived well in chlorhexidine but their viability was significantly reduced by the mandelic acid formulations. These results suggest that bladder instillations of mandelic acid or mandelic/lactic acids would be more effective than chlorhexidine in eliminating biofilms from catheter surfaces.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of human amniotic membranes.
AB  - Amniotic membranes are widely used in a multitude of surgical applications and have been shown to reduce bacterial counts and promote healing in infected wounds. Antibacterial properties of amniotic fluid are well documented and the presence of many potentially antibacterial factors has been demonstrated. No such factors have yet been found in amniotic membranes. We have applied a direct disc-diffusion susceptibility test to try to establish the possible existence of such a factor. Amniotic membranes did not inhibit five bacterial species when tested at 3 X 10(6) and 3 X 10(8) colony forming units/ml. However, complete growth inhibition of all organisms was seen immediately under the amniotic membrane discs. These results support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial effect of amniotic membranes in vitro is due to their close adherence to the wound surface.
TI  - Differentiation of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides and Haemophilus species in gram-stained direct smears.
AB  - The accuracy of examination of the Gram-stained direct smear to classify presumptively Gram-negative rods into three morphotype groups, that is, (a) Enteric bacteria, (b) Pseudomonas, and (c) Bacteroides or Haemophilus, was evaluated. Randomly selected clinical strains (4-9) each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Ps. aeruginosa, B. fragilis, and H. influenzae were used to produce peritonitis or subcutaneous abscesses in mice. A Gram-stained direct smear was prepared from exudate collected from each animal. The direct smears were examined to classify bacteria observed into one of the three morphotype groups. The percent accuracy was 82, 56, and 95, respectively, and 76 overall. The assumption was made that classification was based primarily on differences in length and width of the organisms. To test this hypothesis, we prepared scanning electron photomicrographs from each specimen of exudate and measured the lengths and widths of bacteria. Examination of the Gram-stained direct smear was more accurate for classification of enteric bacteria, H. influenzae, or B. fragilis. Electron microscopy was more accurate for classification of Ps. aeruginosa. The higher length-width radio should be helpful in recognizing Ps. aeruginosa in direct smears.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of lomefloxacin in vitro.
AB  - The MIC of lomefloxacin was determined for 554 isolates from the urinary tract. Some of the more resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied in a dynamic in-vitro model in order to study dosing strategies. The model simulated, in Mueller-Hinton broth, the profile of plasma lomefloxacin concentrations in volunteers. Bacteria were exposed to a range of lomefloxacin concentration profiles achievable by oral dosing. The first dose of lomefloxacin was rapidly bactericidal in a dose-dependent manner for all strains. On re-exposure, a dose-dependent inhibitory effect was observed. Drug-resistant mutants were readily isolated from all bacteria tested on lomefloxacin-containing plates. These occurred at a high frequency in P. aeruginosa (10(-1)), but less frequently in K. pneumoniae (10(-3)). P. mirabilis (10(-5)), and E. coli (10(-6)). The number of resistant mutants isolated tended to be lower with use of higher drug concentrations. The results suggest that lomefloxacin dosing regimens ensuring maintenance of a high serum concentration: MIC ratio will result in maximal antibacterial effects and minimal problems with resistant strains.
TI  - Freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  - Freeze-substitution was performed on strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Campylobacter fetus, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, Caulobacter crescentus, and Leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. A thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width was displayed in E. coli K-12, K30, and His 1 (a K-12 derivative containing the K30 capsule genes), P. multocida, C. fetus, P. putida, A. salmonicida, H. pleuropneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. The other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. Capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular to the cell surface, was observed on E. coli K30 and His 1 and P. mirabilis cells. A more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of H. pleuropneumoniae. For the first time a capsule, distinct from the sheath, was observed on L. discophora. In all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. Other distinct envelope structures were observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of L. discophora and the S layers of A. salmonicida A450 and C. crescentus CB15A. We believe that the freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.
TI  - Effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis on adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and gentamicin-containing PMMA.
AB  - The goals of this study were to determine 1) effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis adherence and biofilm production on adherence of the opportunistic pathogens Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA); 2) if the biofilm killed by autoclaving altered adherence of other organisms; 3) if adherence of S. epidermidis to gentamicin-containing PMMA altered adherence of the opportunistic pathogens P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa to gentamicin-containing PMMA. Results show that biofilms formed by S. epidermidis, whether alive or dead, significantly increased adherence of Pseudomonas. Adherence of Proteus was significantly increased on dead biofilms and increased, but not significantly (p = less than 0.1), on live ones. Greatest adherence seen in the study was to autoclaved biofilms. Significant adherence of Proteus and Pseudomonas was found on gentamicin-containing PMMA specimens, which were preincubated with S. epidermidis for formation on the biofilm. These results indicate that a biofilm is formed on PMMA-gentamicin specimens and this may impair the ability of gentamicin to kill other organisms.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Open randomized controlled parallel study of ofloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of lower respiratory tract and urinary infections.
AB  - A total of 60 patients with lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections were enrolled in an open, randomized, controlled, parallel study comparing 300 mg ofloxacin (OFX) b.i.d. with trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (TMP 800 mg + SMX 160 mg), 1 tablet, b.i.d. The signs and symptoms of low respiratory tract infection were cured in 12 patients (80%) of the OFX group and improved in 2 other patients (13%); at the end of therapy, the 2 germs that persisted were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients (86%) in the TMP-SMX group, while 2 patients were considered as failures (14%); after therapy, the 3 organisms that persisted were 2 S. pneumoniae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As far as urinary tract infections are concerned clinical cure and complete eradication of bacteria were achieved in 14 patients in the OFX group (93%); the germ that persisted was Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU), but the patient was asymptomatic. In patients of the TMP-SMX group the urinary infections were cured in 11 subjects (73%); the germs that persisted were 2 E. coli and 1 Proteus mirabilis. Adverse effects were reported for 3 patients (10%) in the OFX group and 4 patients (13%) in the TMP-SMX group. The measurement of serum and intracellular (polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes) levels of OFX and TMP-SMX and the assessment of the host's immunocompetence ruled out the possibility of any immunotoxicological side effect.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of goats suffering from clinical PPR: isolation and identification.
AB  - Bacteriological isolation of aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of achondroplastic West African dwarf goats showing clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and the laboratory procedures carried out for the identification of the isolates are described. From a total of forty nasal swabs obtained seventy five isolates were recovered. The percentage frequency of isolation of different organisms in descending order of occurrence is as follows: Staphylococcus 44.0%; Streptococcus 22.67%; Neisseria 12.00%; Pasteurella 10.67%; Pseudomonas 4.00%; Proteus 4.00% and Corynebacterium 1.33%. A further break-down using biochemical tests revealed that Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 30.67% of the total bacteria isolates; Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.33%; Streptococcus viridans 18.67%; Streptococcus pyogenes 4.00%; Neisseria catarrhalis 12.00%; Proteus mirabilis 2.67%; Proteus rettgeri 1.33%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5.33%; Pasteurella multocida 4.00%; Pasteurella haemolytica 6.67% and Corynebacterium pyogenes 1.33%.
TI  - Rhythmic bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics at a large hospital.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility response of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a set of antibiotics was investigated in a survey comprising 19,380 positive cultures over a period of 5 years in a large hospital environment. Four out of the five species (P. aeruginosa being the exception) presented a species-specific, drug-independent, rhythmic variation of their level of susceptibility to several antibiotics over the time of the study. The species-specific rhythmic responses were further characterized by spectral analysis, autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. Through this analysis it was possible to rank the species according to their main period of oscillation. The longest period of oscillation was detected for S. aureus (38 months). K. pneumoniae and E. coli presented intermediate values (25 and 23 months respectively), and P. mirabilis the shortest period of oscillation (11 months). Species displaying long periods of oscillation tended to present very low levels of susceptibility, while species displaying short periods of oscillation usually presented the highest levels of susceptibility observed. Although some hospital environmental factors, such as drug consumption, were also analyzed, no correlation was found between them and the in vitro bacterial cyclic responses to antibiotics.
TI  - Ability of uropathogens to bind to Tamm Horsfall protein-coated renal tubular cells.
AB  - Epithelial cells were isolated from a healthy human kidney and found to be of normal, renal tubular origin. The cells were maintained in tissue culture and found to secrete Tamm Horsfall protein (THP). Three strains of uropathogenic Escherichia coli, and one each of Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to adhere to the THP-coated tubular cells. Extraneous THP bound to all the organisms except P fimbriated E. coli, and caused a reduction in the adhesion of type 1 fimbriated E. coli and P. mirabilis to the renal cells. However, irrespective of reduced adhesion in three of five strains tested, there was adequate evidence to indicate that THP does not competitively exclude all uropathogenic adhesion. On the contrary, its presence on renal cells may act to mediate bacterial colonization.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - [Studies on the sub-MIC of beta-lactam antibiotics--bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum].
AB  - Bactericidal activity in compromised host's serum i.e. patients with cancer, the  elderly, diabetes, was stronger than that in normal serum against Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) but was weaker against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). Against Escherichia coli (E. coli), bactericidal activity on serum of patients with cancer was weaker in the following order, that in elderly serum, that in diabetic serum. Against Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), bactericidal activity in elderly serum was similar to that in normal serum but was stronger than that in serum of patients with cancer. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), bactericidal activity in elderly serum and diabetic serum was similar to that in normal serum but was weaker than that in serum of patients with cancer. Piperacillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, normal serum and compromised host's serum at a concentration of 1/4 MIC against E. coli, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa. Aspoxicillin showed bactericidal activity in nutrient broth, and bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity in normal serum and serum of patients with cancer against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. While cefazolin and cefmetazole slightly inhibited the growth of bacteria in nutrient broth, they showed hardly any bactericidal activity in normal serum and compromised host's serum.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Antibody coated bacteria in urine of patients with recent spinal injury.
AB  - Twenty patients with an acute spinal injury were prospectively studied to assess  the clinical importance of antibody coated bacteria (ACB) in the urine and the association among the different bacterial species with a positive antibody coated bacteria test. Clinical urinary tract infection was associated with a positive ACB test on 45% of occasions. Three hundred and ninety nine urine samples containing 541 bacterial isolates were assessed for the presence of ACB; 13% were found to be positive and 87% negative for ACB; 67% of urines contained a single bacterial isolate. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most commonly associated with clinical urinary tract infection, found in 25% of episodes, followed by Proteus mirabilis (17.5%), Klebsiella sp (12.5%), and Proteus morganii (10%). Providencia stuartii, however, was most commonly associated with a positive ACB test (found in 17%). Other bacteria associated with a positive ACB test included Klebsiella sp (14%), Acinetobacter sp (12.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Citrobacter sp (11.5%). A positive ACB test is not to be expected from a patient with spinal injury who has a catheter in place, and the test may provide a useful guide to identify those patients with an invasive infection. It is doubtful that a decision to treat or not treat bacteriuria could rest on the identification of the bacterial species alone.
TI  - [Cooperation between the urologist and microbiologist in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. II. The most common microbial species and their sensitivity to antimicrobial drugs in sepsis at the Urologic Clinic of the Medical School Hospital].
AB  - The authors investigated the spectrum of aetiological agents and their sensitivity to antimicrobial substances in 52 patients with septicaemia at the Urological Clinic in Hradec Kralove during 1984-1987. They found a predominating number of Gram-negative bacteria (82%). The most frequent agent producing sepsis was Klebsiella pneumoniae (19X), its source were in 52% the urinary pathways and 16% the cannula in the subclavian vein. In nine instances the aetiological agent was Escherichia coli and 5 times Proteus mirabilis. The above microorganisms are the most important pathogenic organisms of the urinary pathways. In all cases of bacteriaemia urosepsis was involved. The source of sepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7X) was in 43% the urinary tract, in particular in conjunction with instrumental procedures and in 14% a cannula in the subclavian vein. The most effective antimicrobial substance in Gram-negative bacteraemia in the investigated group was amicacin (100%); high sensitivity was recorded also in colistin. In Gram-positive bacteriaemia, where most frequently enterococci were isolated (6X), ampicillin and vancomycin were most effective.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - The effect of protein and urine on uropathogen adhesion to polymer substrata.
AB  - Uropathogenic adhesion was measured using a range of polymer materials with differing surface tension properties. Experiments were carried out in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (controls), Tamm Horsfall protein (THP), and human urine with quantitation by image analysis. The results showed that THP did not bind to the polymer materials and therefore did not act as a receptor surface for type 1 fimbriated Escherichia coli. However, the THP did interfere with adhesion by binding directly to these organisms as well as to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and, to a lesser extent, Proteus mirabilis. Incubation of the uropathogens in THP and urine resulted in altered adhesion profiles to polymer surfaces, with no single trend apparent. The results emphasize that fluid components, particularly proteins, and substratum surface tension influence bacterial adhesion to biomaterials.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of gentamicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of gentamicin (GM), compared with activities of other aminoglycosides (AGs) and beta-lactam antibiotics, were studied against clinical isolates obtained during a period of July-December 1989. 1. GM-resistant strains were noted in 24% of Staphylococcus aureus, 12% of Enterobacter spp., 24% of Serratia marcescens, 7% of Morganella morganii and 26% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but no GM-resistant strains were observed among isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris. 2. A majority of GM-resistant strains of S. aureus were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and a large number of GM-resistant strains of Enterobacter spp. was also resistant to new quinolones. GM showed, however, strong antimicrobial activities against new quinolones-resistant strains of S. marcescens, M. morganii and P. aeruginosa. 3. Among all the isolates tested of S. marcescens, 24% were GM-resistant, 72% were tobramycin (TOB)-resistant, 86% were dibekacin (DKB)-resistant and 64% were amikacin (AMK)-resistant, hence the incidence of GM-resistant strains was the lowest. This tendency was also observed with P. vulgaris. However, among P. aeruginosa, 26% were GM-resistant, 14% TOB-resistant, 18% DKB-resistant and 22% AMK-resistant, thus the incidence rate for GM-resistance was somewhat higher. These results suggest that different AGs-modification enzymes were produced by various clinical isolates under the present condition. 4. Comparing the ratio of GM-resistant strains in the present study with those in 1980 and 1983, the ratio increased among S. aureus, while decreases were observed among Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa, indicating that a unilateral tendency of increases in GM-resistant strains did not exist among clinical isolates over the years.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the Bacteroides fragilis recA gene.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.5-kb DNA segment containing the Bacteroides fragilis recA gene was determined. The coding region of the recA gene specifies a protein of 318 amino acids. The RecA protein of B. fragilis shows significant homology with that of Escherichia coli, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. No SOS box characteristic of LexA-regulated promoters could be identified in the 5'-noncoding region of the B. fragilis recA gene. Promoter activity of the cloned recA gene in E. coli was located within a 113-bp fragment of the B. fragilis DNA by in vitro construction of operon fusions with a promoterless lacZ gene. The transcription start point for this gene in B. fragilis was determined by primer extension analysis.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to urethral catheters.
AB  - Closed sterile catheter drainage has markedly reduced the incidence of nosocomial urinary tract infections. Infections that occur during closed drainage must ascend by colonizing the catheter or urethra. Our study compared adherence by different bacterial species to different catheter surfaces. We found no bacteria adhering to the hydrophilic catheter surface. Of the gram-negative bacteria Proteus mirabilis showed the greatest adherence to the other catheters and it, like most bacteria, showed the most marked adherence to the red rubber catheter.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Open trial of cefepime (BMY 28142) for infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum, semisynthetic parenteral cephem antibiotic, were evaluated in an open trial at a single hospital. Seventy patients were treated with cefepime: 44 had lower respiratory tract infections, 4 had urinary tract infections, and 22 had skin or soft tissue infections. Of 65 clinically evaluable patients, 64 (98%) had satisfactory responses. No mortality or superinfections occurred. Of 57 respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, 54 (95%) were eradicated and 3 (5%) persisted after therapy. Five bacteremias (two with Streptococcus pneumoniae and one each with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and a coagulase-negative staphylococcus) were eradicated. MICs ranged from 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for 13 S. aureus and 9 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and were less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 10 streptococcal isolates. Adverse effects occurred in two patients: transient diarrhea and Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool in one patient and loose bowel movements and increased transaminases in the other patient. Cefepime appeared to be well tolerated in humans and was effective against a wide range of isolates, including S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Mucinophilic and chemotactic properties of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in relation to  pulmonary colonization in cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Representative isolates of nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied to investigate the hypothesis that mucinophilic and chemotactic properties in this species act as potential factors in the initial stages of pulmonary colonization in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Transmission electron microscopy with a surfactant monolayer technique was used in a novel manner to demonstrate the adhesion of all 10 P. aeruginosa strains examined to porcine gastric mucin and tracheobronchial mucin from a patient with CF. Control experiments showed that Escherichia coli K-12 and single representatives of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella aerogenes did not bind to these mucins. The Adler capillary technique, used to measure bacterial chemotactic response, showed that purified CF mucin acted as a chemoattractant for most P. aeruginosa strains, with the exception of the nonmotile mutant M2Fla- and the nonchemotactic mutant WR-5. The ability of the major sugar and amino acid components of mucin to act as chemoattractants was investigated. The degree of chemotaxis was strain specific; optimum chemotaxis was observed toward serine, alanine, glycine, proline, and threonine. No strain showed chemotaxis to N-acetylneuraminic acid, but all strains showed a strain-dependent chemotactic response to the sugars L-fucose, D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. These results provide new information on the mucinophilic and chemotactic properties of nonmucoid P. aeruginosa and support the hypothesis that these properties could play a role in the initial stages of pulmonary colonization in patients with CF.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of RU 51746 (sodium salt of cefpodoxime). Results of a multicenter study].
AB  - Cefpodoxime proxetil, a new oral cephalosporin, is the prodrug ester of cefpodoxime. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of RU 51746 (sodium salt of cefpodoxime: CPD) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1 696 bacterial strains isolated in 5 hospitals. For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC 50 and 90% were respectively (micrograms/ml): (1) naturally non betalactamase producing species: E. coli, Shigella and Salmonella 0.25-0.5; P. mirabilis 0.06-0.12. (II) chromosomal penicillinase producing species: Klebsiella 0.12-1. (III) chromosomal cephalosporinase producing species: E. cloacae and C. freundii 2-greater than 128; S. marcescens 2-64; indole + Proteus 0.25-64; P. stuartii 0.25-16. Activity of CPD was not modified on plasmid mediated penicillinase producing strains, but CPD was inactive on cephalosporinase hyperproducing strains, and on broad spectrum betalactamases producing strains. CPD was inactive on P. aeruginosa (MIC greater than or equal to 64) and on A. baumannii (16-pi 128). Haemophilus, regardless on betalactamase production status, were very susceptible to CPD (MIC less than or equal to 0.25) and B. catarrhalis was generally inhibited by 0.12 to 1. CPD was poorly active on methicillin susceptible Staphylococci (MIC 50 and 90%: 2-4) and inactive on methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes were generally resistant; Streptococci A, B, C, G and Pneumococci were inhibited by low concentration: 0.002 to 0.25 (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.016-0.032) whereas MIC for other Streptococci were 0.004 to 32 (MIC 50 and 90%: 0.25-4). These antibacterial properties placed CPD in excellent position among oral cephalosporins.
TI  - [In vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
AB  - Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for Serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), Proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive Proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and Providencia (1 mu/ml). The MICs of cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against Acinetobacter (mode MIC 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). The MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 0.5) for Haemophilus and from 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. The MICs for N. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. Methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low MICs ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 0.016). The MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). The MICs for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 1-2). With the exception of Clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode MIC 0.06 for C. Perfringens and 0.03 for Bacteroides fragilis).
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - Recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  - We treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. Four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. All recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. At the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. The bacterial species isolated were S. epidermidis, group D streptococcus, P. acnes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. All patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. Factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. A single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. Patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.
TI  - Bacterial phospholipid analysis by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
AB  - The structural analysis of naturally occurring bacterial phospholipids in mixtures by fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry are reported. The bacterial strains examined included several genera of actinomycetes, two strains of Escherichia coli, and one strain each of Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. FAB mass spectrometry proved to be a useful tool for the structural identification of phospholipids in mixtures and provided stable pseudo-molecular ions and characteristic fragment ions which permitted the identification of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidyl choline. Information regarding the chain length of the fatty acids, their degree of unsaturation in the chains and the presence of hydroxyl groups was also obtained. The results obtained by FAB mass spectrometry were supported by high-resolution mass spectral data, tandem mass spectrometric studies and FAB mass spectrometry of components which had been separated and partially purified by thin-layer chromatography. Each organism displayed a highly characteristic phospholipid profile suggesting the possible use of FAB mass spectrometry as a method for rapid bacterial detection and identification.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of the main opportunistic pathogenic aerobic bacteria].
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity of 1421 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. was studied. Gentamicin, levomycetin (chloramphenicol) and ristomycin proved to be the antibiotics of choice in treatment of purulent inflammatory diseases caused by S. epidermidis and S. aureus. For antibiotic therapy of infections caused by gram-negative organisms gentamicin and polymixin might be recommended.
TI  - Nonspecific resistance-enhancing activity of zymosan in experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The nonspecific resistance-enhancing activity of zymosan on experimental bacterial (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus) infections was investigated. Zymosan, being of very low toxicity, significantly enhanced nonspecific resistance to the above bacteria. The enhancement was the most pronounced 2 to 5 days after zymosan treatment.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. II. Clinical observations].
AB  - A study was made of 92 bacteremia episodes among patients admitted to the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy) between June 1986 and September 1989. A single microorganism was isolated in 84 episodes (91.3%), the most common being: Staphylococcus aureus (21.7%), Escherichia coli (18.5%), Enterococcus (9.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (5.4%). The episodes were of both hospital and community origin: 54.3% vs. 45.7%. Their main sources were: the urinary tract (16.3%), abdominal infections (14.2%), endocarditis (7.6%), and the respiratory tract (5.5%). No source could be identified in 26%. Brucellosis, salmonellosis and listeriosis together constituted 8.7% of the episodes. Abdominal infections were primarily responsible for the 8 cases (8.7%) of polymicrobial bacteremia. The overall mortality was 18.5% (6.5% community vs. 12% hospital episodes). Mortality directly due to bacteremia was 8.7%. Bacteremia was the direct or indirect cause of death in 22.6% of patients greater than or equal to 65, compared with 19% and 10% in those aged 35-64 and 15-44 respectively. The patient's clinical picture at the time of infection was a prognostic factor: mortality was much lower in subjects previously healthy or free from basic diseases (11.8%) than in those with non-rapidly-fatal diseases (21.7%) or rapidly-fatal diseases (54.5%). Bacteremia-linked mortality (direct and indirect) was higher in Gram-positive vs Gram-negative infections: 22.2% vs 15.8%. Mortality was 12.5% in the group of patients with polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Correlation between disc potency and zone size in temafloxacin activity in vitro.
AB  - A multi-test disc potency evaluation of a new fluoroquinolone, temafloxacin, has  been prepared in order to evaluate the variation of the zone dimension with the disc antibiotic concentration. A direct correlation between these parameters has been demonstrated. All pathogens have been isolated in hospitalized patients.
TI  - [Stimulation of nonspecific antibacterial resistance of mice to opportunistic gram-negative microorganisms with triterpene glycosides from Holothuroidea].
AB  - A total fraction of triterpenic glycosides from Cucumaria japonica named cucumarioside was used as a stimulator of nonspecific resistance to bacterial infections in mice. After intraperitoneal administration to mice subsequently infected with various strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis, cucumarioside provided survival of 40 to 90 per cent of the infected animals against 100 per cent in the control group. The protective effect directly depended on the dose of cucumarioside. It was optimal to administer the preparation 3 days before the infection. When the preparation was administered at such periods LD50 for Neisseria meningitidis BT-2 and Salmonella minnesota SF 1111 lowered 5 and 4.3 times, respectively. Therefore, the total fraction of triterpenic glycosides from Far Eastern holothuria had a marked ability to increase natural resistance of the animals to infections caused by various gram-negative organisms.
TI  - [Sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  - 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "C.S. Virgen de la Arrixaga" in Murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. The common infection was significantly associated to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus A group and Neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescens y Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter. We did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by E. Coli and Proteus mirabilis. These factors were associated to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the imipenem/cilastatin combination in the therapy of severe infections in patients with malignant diseases.
AB  - Thirty hospitalized patients (23 men and 7 women), aged 42 to 78 years, with impaired host defences for malignant underlying diseases and affected by life-threatening infections, were treated with the imipenem/cilastatin combination at a dosage ranging between 2 and 4 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 9.6 +/- 2.09 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12], Escherichia coli [10], Klebsiella pneumoniae [5], Proteus mirabilis [3], P. vulgaris [2], Serratia marcescens [1], Staphylococcus aureus [3], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Bacteroides fragilis [5]. In fourteen patients a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-three patients (76.66%) were completely cured of infection and 35 out of 44 isolated organisms (79.54%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - Sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (O), flagellar (H) and capsular (Vi) antigens of Salmonella typhi. The assay based on anti-O monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect S. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from S. typhi. Anti-H MoAbs detected motile S. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect Vi-containing S. typhi as well as soluble Vi antigen. The three assays reported here detected S. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing Salmonella senftenberg, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis or Streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia. The assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.
TI  - Receptors for human plasminogen on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A total of 188 strains representing 11 species of gram-negative bacteria were examined for the ability to interact with human plasminogen. Highly purified human plasminogen was labeled with 125I, and its uptake by different bacterial strains was measured. All 14 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and all 13 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis tested were positive with respect to plasminogen uptake. Also, eight species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae were tested, and of those, Proteus mirabilis demonstrated the most substantial uptake, with 28 of 39 strains taking up more than 10% of the plasminogen. Ten strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also tested, of which seven showed uptake values higher than 10%. With H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis strains, Scatchard analysis indicated a two-phase receptor interaction, one more-avid receptor with a Kd of 6 to 8 nM and 2,000 to 2,500 sites per bacterium and a second receptor with a Kd of 50 to 80 nM and 9,000 sites per bacterium. With Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, a single receptor interaction was detected with a Kd of 60 nM and the number of sites was estimated as 8,000 per bacterium. Scatchard analysis with strains of P. mirabilis indicated binding of a less-specific nature. However, plasminogen uptake by this species could be reduced by 50% by the addition of 2 mM unlabeled plasminogen. This estimate of Kd, as well as uptake studies with plasminogen fragments, suggests different properties of this receptor. With all receptor types, the addition of plasmin-aprotinin complex inhibited plasminogen uptake, which demonstrates that both forms of the molecule react with the same receptors. Plasminogen uptake could be eliminated by the addition of lysine or epsilon-aminocaproic acid, which suggests that the lysine-binding sites of the plasminogen molecule are involved in the receptor-ligand interaction.
TI  - [Antibacterial action of some saturated and unsaturated long-chain carboxylic acids and their bis(2-chloroethyl)aminoethyl esters in vitro].
AB  - Using the method of twofold serial dilution of substances in liquid nutrient medium with subsequent reseeding on solid nutrient medium a comparative study has been carried out of the antibacterial action in vitro of long chain saturated (C10-C18) and unsaturated (C11-C22) carboxylic acids and their bis(2-chloroethyl)aminoethyl esters against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae tp 16 Koph, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus 101+ and Proteus mirabilis 56. The compounds studied have an inhibitory effect upon the development of the microorganisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration ranges from 1.8 to 19.3 mumol/ml. There exists a linear correlation between the length of the carbon chain (the number of C atoms) of the compounds and the minimum inhibitory concentration in the following cases: esters of saturated acids (C16-C24) and unsaturated acids (C11-C22) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; unsaturated acids (C11-C22) against Klebsiella pneumoniae tp 16 Koph; esters of unsaturated acids (C17-C28) against Staphylococcus aureus 101+. This correlation has not been found in all other compounds against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Proteus mirabilis 56.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime in serious infections. A prospective, controlled clinical trial with third-party blinding.
AB  - Oral ciprofloxacin has been shown to be effective in the treatment of infections  due to gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. The efficacy and safety of intravenous ciprofloxacin was compared with that of intravenous ceftazidime in the treatment of 59 patients with well-documented serious infections in a prospective, controlled, randomized study with a third-party blinding. Thirty-three patients were treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 mg every 12 hours, plus a daily extra placebo dose); 26 patients were treated with ceftazidime (1 g every eight hours). The severity of the infections, underlying diseases, and demographic features were comparable in both groups, although there were more men in the ciprofloxacin group. For ciprofloxacin/ceftazidime treatments, respectively, the evaluated infections were: pyelonephritis (16 patients/nine patients), pneumonia (three/five), soft-tissue infections (four/zero), spontaneous peritonitis (five/two), primary bacteremia (three/eight), and other (two/two). Isolated pathogens included: Escherichia coli (22/12), Klebsiella sp. (five/four), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two/three), Haemophilus influenzae (one/one), Proteus mirabilis (two/zero), Proteus vulgaris (one/zero), Salmonella sp. (zero/two), Plesiomonas shigelloides (one/zero), and others (one/four). The clinical responses were cure or improvement in 31 ciprofloxacin cases/21 ceftazidime cases; failure, zero/four; and indeterminate, two/one. The bacteriologic responses were eradication in 28 ciprofloxacin cases/22 ceftazidime cases; persistence, one/three; and indeterminate, four/one. Mild intolerance occurred in three ciprofloxacin cases and two ceftazidime cases. A mild increase in serum hepatic enzymes was observed in two patients in each group. Superinfections occurred in five patients: enterococcal septicemia (zero/two) and urinary tract infections (one/two). The results presented suggest that intravenous ciprofloxacin is an effective and safe antimicrobial agent for the treatment of serious infections, with an efficacy comparable with that of ceftazidime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. An additional advantage seems to be a lower rate of superinfections.
TI  - [Bacteremia secondary to decubitus ulcer].
AB  - We have prospectively evaluated 16 episodes of bacteremia induced by decubitus ulcers. The most commonly isolated microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis. Bacteremia was polymicrobial in 5 cases (31%). Most ulcers were already present at the time of admission, but bacteremia developed within the hospital in 13 patients. In 3 patients, ulcers did not show local features of infection. The initial antibiotic therapy was satisfactory in 13 cases. Mortality rate directly associated with bacteremia was 18%, but the overall mortality rate was 62%. We did not identify data permitting a reliable prediction of the findings of blood culture; therefore, the initial empirical therapy should be active against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, enteric Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Glutathione transferase in bacteria: subunit composition and antigenic characterization.
AB  - The presence of glutathione transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) in Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 25422, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 8427, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella oxytoca CIP 666, K. oxytoca AF 101, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 6085, Serratia marcescens CIP 6755, and Proteus mirabilis AF 2924 was investigated. Using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate, GST activity was found in the glutathione-(GSH-)affinity-purified fraction of all strains tested. SDS-PAGE analysis of GSH-affinity-purified enzyme indicated that the GSTs of all these bacteria are dimers of two identical subunits of Mr about 22,500. Rabbit antiserum directed against the major isoenzyme present in Proteus mirabilis AF 2924, Pm-GST-6.0, was used to investigate the antigenic properties of bacterial GSTs. Western blot analysis indicated that a GST antigenically identical to Pm-GST-6.0 is present in Enterobacter cloacae CIP 6085, Escherichia coli ATCC 25422 and Proteus vulgaris ATCC 8427, but absent in Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella oxytoca CIP 666, K. oxytoca AF 101 and Serratia marcescens CIP 6755. The presence of Pm-GST-6.0, but not mammalian GST, increased the MIC values of amikacin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, cephalothin and nalidixic acid for E. coli ATCC 25922. It is suggested that bacterial GST may represent a defense against the effects of antibiotics.
TI  - [Antibacterial effect of cefixime].
AB  - Cefixime (CFM) is a new hemi-synthetic orally active cephalosporin which exhibits a particular affinity for PBPs 3, 1a, 1bs. Its penetration through the Gram negative bacilli outer membrane is similar to that of third generation cephalosporins. The MICs were assessed by the agar dilution method against 2,489 bacterial strains collected in 10 hospitals. Against Enterobacteriaceae, MICs50 and 90 are respectively (mg/l): naturally non beta-lactamase-producing species: E. coli and Shigella: 0.25-0.5, Salmonella: 0.06 - 0.25, P. mirabilis: 0.008 - 0.0.32; chromosomal penicillinase producing species: Klebsiella: 0.06 - 2; chromosomal cephalosporinase producing species: E. cloacae and C. freundii: 1 - greater than 128, S. marcescens: 0.25 - 16, Proteus indole: + 0.06 - 4, P. stuartii: 0.032 - 0.5. CFM activity is not altered in strains producing an acquired penicillinase. On the other hand, CFM appears to be inactive against cephalosporinase hyperproducing mutants and its activity is variably decreased against expanded spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. CFM is inactive against P. aeruginosa (MIC50 and 90: 64 - 128) and against A. baumannii (16 - 128). Haemophilus and gonococci, beta-lactamase producing or not, as well as meningococci, are highly susceptible to CFM (MIC 0.008 - 0.12). B. catarrhalis is usually inhibited by 0.03 to 0.5. CFM is moderately active against meticillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC50 and 90: 1-64), and inactive against meticillin-resistant strains. Enterococci are usually resistant, whereas streptococci and pneumococci are inhibited by low concentrations: 0.08 to 1. CFM is a bactericidal antibiotic, as shown by MBC and killing curves determination. These antibacterial properties relate CFM to the third generation cephalosporins and position the compound in an excellent place among the orally active cephalosporins.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - [The effect of an immune antibacterial plasma and a donor leukocyte mass on the immune system of patients with suppurative-septic processes].
AB  - The influence of immune antistaphylococcal, anti-Proteus and anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa plasma and donor leukocyte mass on some humoral and cell-mediated immunity characteristics in patients with purulent and septic diseases has been studied. The study has shown that treatment with immune plasma leads to an increase in the amount of circulating T lymphocytes and in the concentration of IgA, IgM and IgG, to the activation of phagocytosis and to an increase in the titers of the corresponding antimicrobial antibodies simultaneously with a decrease in the content of bacterial antigens in the blood serum. Treatment with donor leukocyte mass has also been found to lead to an increase in the concentration of T lymphocytes and immunoglobulins, to enhance the functional activity of phagocytizing neutrophils and to promote the normalization of the content of leukocytes in the peripheral blood. The use of these preparations as stimulating agents in the treatment of patients having purulent septic diseases and, simultaneously, low cell-mediated immunity characteristics is recommended.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - Therapeutic activity of meropenem in experimental infections.
AB  - Meropenem and comparative antibiotics were evaluated in five models of infection. All antibiotics were administered parenterally; imipenem was used in combination with cilastatin but meropenem and other agents were given alone. Generalized infections in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa all responded to low doses of meropenem or imipenem. Immunocompromised mice infected with Ps. aeruginosa responded to slightly higher doses of meropenem or gentamicin but required four to seven times the dose of other agents. Those given a greater challenge of Ps. aeruginosa were treated most successfully by meropenem. Treatment with meropenem, imipenem or ceftazidime caused significant reductions of E. coli in the urinary bladder and kidneys of mice challenged per urethram. Infection with Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia localized to the subcutaneous neck tissue of guinea pigs was also treated successfully. Lung infections caused by Ps. aeruginosa in guinea pigs were treated effectively by meropenem, imipenem, and ceftazidime at the dose of 10 mg/kg but only meropenem eradicated bacteria from all the tissues examined. These results demonstrate that meropenem has excellent antibacterial activity in vivo in both normal and immunocompromised animals and in some models of infection is superior to imipenem.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of SM7338, a new carbapenem antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SM7338 was tested against 670 routine clinical isolates and 130 cefoperazone-resistant isolates of bacteria by agar dilution methods. SM7338 was at least as active as imipenem against gram-negative organisms but was slightly less active against gram-positive organisms. SM7338 was particularly active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with MICs for 90% of strains of less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for all species tested. Differences in activity between SM7338 and imipenem were particularly striking against Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii, against which MICs of SM7338 and imipenem for 90% of strains were 0.125 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The presence of unique plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PU21 transconjugants did not affect activity substantially, except in the case of OXA-2 (eightfold-increased MIC) and OXA-3 (fourfold-increased MIC). SM7338 was also active against a laboratory-derived strain of P. aeruginosa which hyperproduced chromosomal beta-lactamase, inhibiting both the wild type and the mutant at a concentration of 1.0 micrograms/ml.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin against strains  isolated from clinical material].
AB  - The susceptibility of 392 strains of pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical material of hospitalized patients in Institute for Chest Diseases Golnik were studied. 100 strains of Escherichia coli, 56 strains of Enterobacter spp., 40 strains of Proteus mirabilis, 50 strains of Gram negative nonfermentative bacteria, 46 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 100 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin were determined by agar dilution test. The susceptibility of tested strains is greater to ciprofloxacin, except susceptibility of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, which is greater to pefloxacin. Strains of nonfermentative bacteria have lower susceptibility to both quinolones.
TI  - Rapid flow cytometric bacterial detection and determination of susceptibility to  amikacin in body fluids and exudates.
AB  - A flow cytometry-based method for rapid and quantitative detection of bacteria in various clinical specimens and for rapid determination of antibiotic effect is described. Achieving such a measurement with high sensitivity required discrimination between bacteria and other particles which were often present in clinical samples in high concentrations. This discrimination was facilitated by detecting the bacterial characteristic light scatter and fluorescence signals following staining, e.g., with the fluorescent nucleic acid-binding dye ethidium bromide, as well as by measuring bacterial proliferation during short time intervals. Antibiotic susceptibility was measured by observing the inhibition of such proliferation. The method was applied to 43 clinical specimens from various sources, such as wound exudates, bile, serous cavity fluids, and bronchial lavage. Bacterial detection, achieved in less than 2 h, agreed with results of conventional methods with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 88%. Susceptibility to amikacin was detected in 1 h in 92% of 13 positive specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - [Frequency of germ isolation from urinary infections in community practice; their sensitivity to 7 antibiotics including a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Evaluation on 1611 samples].
AB  - A multicenter study including 10 outpatient private laboratories (hospital laboratories excluded) was carried out in France. 1,611 urines samples from patients with UTI were collected during the forth trimester of 1987. The most frequently recovered pathogens were: E. coli (71%), Proteus mirabilis (9%), Staphylococcus coagulase (6%), Klebsiella (6%), Enterobacter (2%). Other sorts (Streptococcus D, Proteus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter sp) were infrequent (less than 1%). The sensitivity of the aerobic Gram-negative bacteria to ampicillin, clavulanic acid-amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, pipemidic acid, norfloxacin and co-trimoxazole was tested.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Evaluation of the treatment with oral ciprofloxacin: experience with 24 patients].
AB  - We have evaluated the clinical effectiveness and possible side effects of oral ciprofloxacin therapy in 24 patients (11 females and 13 males). Two episodes from overall 25 infections were excluded of clinical and microbiological evaluation but were assessed regarding possible side effects. In most patients, the clinical condition was stable at the beginning of therapy. Only 3 patients had nonfatal diseases. Seventeen episodes were urinary tract infections (four of them with concomitant bacteremia), four chronic osteomyelitis, and two severe soft tissue infections; 21 episodes were monomicrobial, and two polymicrobial. The isolated organisms were mostly aerobic gram negative bacilli or facultative anaerobes: E. coli (9), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas stutzeri (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). There were only two gram positive isolates: Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The overall clinical response rate was 91%. Gastrointestinal tolerance was excellent. Colonization by Candida or Enterococcus developed in 3 cases (13%), and only one of them developed superinfection. Four patients developed several nervous system abnormalities, two increased transaminase activity and one drug exanthema. Ciprofloxacin appears as an effective drug for the monotherapy of several bacterial infections, including severe enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas infections.
TI  - [Effects of sulbactam on the activity of cefoperazone against various clinical isolates].
AB  - Sulbactam/Cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) have been used in clinical infusion at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 in Japan and U.S.A., respectively. After an administration of these drugs as a 1:1 parenteral formulation, the ratio of levels of CPZ and SBT in blood was 1:1/4 to 1:1/5 for 1 to 2 hours, whereas the ratio of free, unbound drug levels was 1:1.4 to 1:1.5. In urine these drugs were excreted at a ratio between 1:1 and 1:4 during 6 hours after the infusion. Antimicrobial interaction studies using various combinations of CPZ and SBT were performed to obtain information with respect to the effect of SBT on the antimicrobial activity of CPZ in vivo and the most appropriate ratio of these drugs for the in vitro test system. Antimicrobial activities were determined using the agar dilution method and the disk diffusion susceptibility test. SBT increased the activity of CPZ against various clinical isolates tested except Enterococcus faecalis. CPZ-SBT at a fixed ratio of 1:1/5 significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of CPZ, resulting in decreases in MIC values and increases in disk inhibitory zone diameters. These drugs at ratios 1:1 to 1:3 maximized the synergistic enhancement of the activity. Therefore, a fixed ratio between 1:1/5 and 1:1 would be appropriate for the in vitro antimicrobial test system using either the agar dilution method or the disk susceptibility test. Based on pharmacokinetic data for CPZ and SBT, results of the present study on antimicrobial activity would support that the parenteral formulation of CPZ-SBT at the fixed ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 for the intravenous infusion used in Japan and U.S.A., respectively, are appropriate. The effect of SBT on the activity of CPZ was more marked against clinical isolates with greater production abilities of beta-lactamase than against those with less production abilities. SBT/CPZ, however, exerted a synergistic effect against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus without beta-lactamase production. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ (1:1) against various clinical isolates with 10(6) CFU/ml inoculum size were as follows: S. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, Staphylococcus epidermis 3.13 micrograms/ml, and E. faecalis 50 micrograms/ml. Those of Gram-negative bacilli were: Escherichia coli 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae 0.20 micrograms/ml, Proteus mirabilis 0.78 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris 0.78 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.5 micrograms/ml, Serratia marcescens 25 micrograms/ml, Enterobacter spp. 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter spp. 12.5 micrograms/ml and Acinetobacter spp. 0.78 microgram/ml.
TI  - Effects of selected carbohydrates and the contribution of the prophenoloxidase cascade system to the adhesion of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis to hemocytes of nonimmune larval Galleria mellonella.
AB  - The adhesion of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis to the plasmatocytes and granular cells of nonimmune larval Galleria mellonella was influenced by and varied with the type of carbohydrate. Laminarin enhanced prophenoloxidase activation and bacterial adhesion to the hemocytes whereas sucrose suppressed both activities. For all other sugars there was no correlation between bacterial adhesion to the hemocytes and phenoloxidase activity. It is proposed that bacterial adhesion to the hemocytes may be mediated by both lectinlike binding and components of the prophenoloxidase activating system acting like opsonins.
TI  - Comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. Of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB  - Urea splitting bacteria are related to the formation of struvite or apatite. We investigated the urease activity of bacteria by two methods; the direct measurement of urease activity of viable bacteria and sonicated bacteria from amounts of ammonia by the indophenol method, and the measurement of urease activity by alkalization of infected urine. Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had moderate activity of urease, and Morganella morganii and Staphylococcus epidermidis had the most powerful activity. P. mirabilis caused the strongest alkalization in infected urine.
TI  - Purification of cross-reacting protein antigen shared by Yersinia enterocolitica  and other gram-negative bacteria with monoclonal antibody.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody against the Yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kDa) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (CRPA), was obtained by cell fusion. The CRPA common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from Y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (IgG1) thus obtained. The purified CRPA showed a single band of 60 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and reacted with rabbit antisera against Y. enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei in Western blot analysis. The monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kDa peptide from Y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such as V. cholerae, E. coli, S. sonnei, Salmonella enteritidis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. The results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on a CRPA molecule.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin in the therapy of severe infections in high-risk patients.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  imipenem/cilastatin in life-threatening infections in high-risk patients. Thirty hospitalized patients (22 men and 8 women), aged 28 to 78 years, with impaired host defences and severe infections were treated with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage ranging between 1 and 3 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 8.61 +/- 3.14 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli [7], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [9], Staphylococcus aureus [5], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Strep. viridans [1], Proteus mirabilis [1], P. vulgaris [2], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], Citrobacter freundii [2], Bacteroides fragilis [2]. In only one patient the aetiological agent remained unknown and in five patients (16.67%) a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-four patients (80%) were completely cured of infection and 29 isolated organisms (82.86%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of monobactams against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of monobactam antibiotics (carumonam (CRMN) and aztreonam (AZT] against Gram-negative bacilli isolated from inpatients in the latter half of 1987 were investigated using penicillin (PC: piperacillin (PIPC], cephems (CEPs: ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefsulodin (CFS], carbapenem (imipenem (IPM] and pyridonecarboxylic acids (norfloxacin (NFLX) and ofloxacin (OFLX] as reference antibiotics. A total of 400 strains of 13 species, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, were used as test strains. 1. CRMN and AZT, both monobactam antibiotics, were roughly comparable in their activities and no resistant strain to these antibiotics were found among isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., M. morganii, P. rettgeri or H. influenzae and few resistant strains were observed among isolates of S. marcescens. On the other hand, isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa included rather numerous strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. Among these cases, whereas R strains, i.e. resistant strains showing MICs greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to PC and CEPs, I strains, i.e. intermediately resistant strains showing MICs between 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml, accounted for a large proportion of strains resistant to the monobactam antibiotics. 2. Strains resistant to PIPC, a PC, were detected with high and more or less uniform frequencies over the entire spectrum of the isolates examined. 3. Antibacterial activities of CEPs varied against different bacterial species. While strains resistant to CTX, CAZ and LMOX were commonly detected with high frequencies among isolates of C. freundii, Enterobacter spp. and S. marcescens, large percentages of LMOX-resistant strains of C. freundii and Enterobacter spp. were of the I type. CTX-resistant strains were also found among isolates of P. vulgaris and M. morganii. Proportions of CEP-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were 28% for CFS and 12% for CAZ. 4. No or few strains among the isolates of 13 species investigated were resistant to IPM, a carbapenem antibiotic, which showed the most stable antibacterial activity, but it was less active than monobactam antibiotics and CEPs against Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis and H. influenzae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of circumcision status on periurethral bacterial flora during the first year of life.
AB  - To determine whether bacterial colonization is a factor in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection, we compared the periurethral bacterial flora of uncircumcised versus circumcised boys during the first year of life. Intraurethral and circumferential glans cultures were obtained from 25 circumcised and 25 uncircumcised infants at 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 months of age. Different children were used at each age (300 total). The types of bacteria and the total and specific colony counts were compared. The results of the glans cultures were similar to those from the urethra. Uncircumcised boys had significantly higher total colony counts (p less than 0.003) at all ages except 12 months. Escherichia coli was present significantly more often (p less than 0.01) in the urethras of uncircumcised boys at 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. Gram-negative uropathogenic organisms (Klebsiella-enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were cultured more frequently (p less than 0.0005) from the urethras of uncircumcised boys at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. The specific colony counts for E. coli and the other uropathogenic organisms were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) at all ages except 12 months. We conclude that during the first 6 months of life, the presence of a foreskin is associated with a greater quantity of periurethral bacteria and a greater likelihood for the presence of, as well as higher concentrations of, potentially uropathogenic organisms.
TI  - In vitro activities of PD 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) CFU per spot). The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibility of gram-negative bacterial isolates to six beta-lactam and two aminoglycoside antibiotics at our university hospital].
AB  - Susceptibilities of Gram-negative bacterial strains isolated at the University Hospital in 1987 to six beta-Lactam antibiotics (azthreonam cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, latamoxef, aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin) and two aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin and amikacin) were examined by agar dilution and the agar diffusion method. Results obtained from both methods correlated well in most of the strains. Most of the strains belonging to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were sensitive to the beta-lactam antibiotics except aminobenzyl-penicillin and piperacillin. They were also sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Most strains of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were sensitive to azthreonam, latamoxef and aminoglycosides, but were less sensitive to other beta-lactams. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was generally resistant to beta-lactams except ceftizoxime, but was sensitive to aminoglycosides. More than half of the strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to azthreonam, piperacillin and aminoglycoside antibiotics and only latamoxef was active in Pseudomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Recurrent gram-negative bacteremia.
AB  - PURPOSE: Recurrent gram-negative bacteremia is defined as two or more episodes of bacteremia occurring in the same patient with an infection-free interval between each episode. Our purpose was to identify patients with recurrent gram-negative bacteremia in order to define possible risk factors for its recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a recently completed prospective study of all episodes of gram-negative bacteremia at the Buffalo Veterans Administration Center between April 1, 1984, and May 31, 1987, 35 patients with 74 episodes of gram-negative bacteremia were identified. The following information was obtained from all 35 patients: age, service, date of hospital admission, date of the bacteremia, underlying diseases, initial antimicrobial therapy, focus of infection, the presence or absence of shock, antimicrobial susceptibility of the blood isolate, and outcome. RESULTS: All 35 patients were men, had a mean age of 69 years, and all had one or more underlying diseases; 45 percent had a malignancy. The duration of time between a pair of episodes was four weeks or more for 74 percent of 38 pairs of episodes. In 25 of 38 (66 percent) pairs of episodes, the focus of infection was the same; in 80 percent of these 25 pairs, the urinary tract was the focus. Overall, the urinary tract was the focus of gram-negative bacteremia in almost 50 percent. Escherichia coli was the single most common organism isolated (28 percent of all episodes), followed by Proteus mirabilis (17.5 percent) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.5 percent). Six of 35 (17 percent) patients died due to gram-negative bacteremia; five of these six had a respiratory tract focus of infection. CONCLUSIONS: In a population of veterans, recurrent gram-negative bacteremia was identified in almost 10 percent of all patients with gram-negative bacteremia during a 37-month study period. Recurrent gram-negative bacteremia most frequently occurred in the setting of underlying malignancy with the urinary tract as a common focus of infection. The mortality rate of 17 percent was similar to that of all patients with gram-negative bacteremia reported in previous studies.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-76,252 (CS-807), a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - U-76,252 is the prodrug of U-76,253. MICs of U-76,253 were 0.015 to 0.06 microgram/ml for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis; 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml for Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter diversus; 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus spp.; and 2 to greater than 16 micrograms/ml for other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Aeromonas hydrophila; for 72% of the latter group, MICs were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis were greater than 16 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Suitability of a propanolic PVP-iodophor preparation as preoperative skin disinfectant: germicidal activity and chemical stability.
AB  - The preparation Solutio Betadini propanolica 3% w/w, used as a pre-operative skin disinfectant was examined for its germicidal activity and its chemical stability. The additive activity of iodine and propanol resulted in a wide range of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, including bacterial spores, and fungi, with a rapid onset and sustained duration of action. The solution is easily manufactured and analyzed, its stability is guaranteed for 6 months. Because of its staining property, there is no need of coloured additives to mark the disinfected area. In addition, no skin irritations by the disinfectant were observed so far. Thus, the preparation fulfills the essential requirements for preoperative skin disinfectants and is suitable for the preparation and the compounding in hospital pharmacies.
TI  - [Immunomodulating therapy of adjuvant disease in rats using cyclophosphamide in combination with prodigiozan--its effect on anti-infectious resistance].
AB  - The effect of immunomodulating therapy of adjuvant disease in rats with cyclophosphamide, prodigiozan and their combinations on infection resistance, weight of the lymphoid organs and leukocyte counts in peripheral blood, as well as the effect of prodigiozan on acute toxicity of cyclophosphamide in intact mice and mice exposed to the Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) was studied. Prodigiozan did not increase acute toxicity of cyclophosphamide in the intact mice. It lowered the cyclophosphamide toxicity at the background of the FCA and decreased the levels of leukopenia induced by the immunosuppressor in the rats with adjuvant arthritis. It was shown on the models of local infectious inflammation caused by Proteus and lethal sepsis due to P. aeruginosa that the combined use of prodigiozan and cyclophosphamide resulted in correction of the infection resistance impairment induced by both the arthritis development and the immunosuppressor administration.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  - Renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. Ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. To study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. The ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. The mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. Preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. Cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach in estimating the effective dosage of cefamandole].
AB  - Reliability of the cefamandole (CMD) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with Showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of CMD). Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the CMD disc tests, which is normally used in Japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose of administration. The results obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The results of the CMD disc susceptibility test were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of MICs. Break points in MIC values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. Only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. In this study, approximately 90% of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by CMD at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to CMD at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. CMD was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. About 90% of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. Susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml CMD of highly methicillin-resistant strains (MIC greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of S. aureus were examined. Ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to CMD, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. Imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. Minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of apalcillin on aerobic bacteria and the regression curve].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of apalcillin (APL) were evaluated by agar dilution on 1,201 bacterial strains isolated simultaneously in four university hospitals; agar diffusion tests (disks APL: 75 micrograms) were performed on these strains to establish relationship between MIC and zone diameters. For Enterobacteriaceae naturally non beta-lactamase-producing (E. coli and P. mirabilis), mode MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml; some acquired penicillinase-producing strains were only inhibited by concentrations greater than or equal to 16. Chromosomal penicillinase producing Klebsiella were inhibited by 2 to 8 micrograms/ml but APL was inactive on acquired penicillinase-producing strains. For chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species (Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, indole + Proteus and Providencia) two populations of strains were observed: one sensitive and the second resistant to carboxypenicillins: on the first population, mode MIC of APL was 1 to 4 micrograms/ml; on the second MIC were generally greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml. P. aeruginosa strains sensitive to carboxypenicillins were inhibited by 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; this activity was diminished on strains resistant to these antibiotics (MIC APL 8-32). MIC of Acinetobacter varied to 0.25 to greater than 128 with a majority of strains inhibited by 4 to 64 micrograms/ml. APL was active against non penicillinase producing Staphylococci; mode MIC was 2 micrograms/ml for Enterococci. Correlation coefficient of regression curve was 0.87. For critical concentrations less than or equal to 8 and greater than 64 micrograms/ml, critical diameters could be greater than or equal to 19 and less than 12 mm.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against clinical isolates in pediatrics].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of gentamicin (GM), along with activities of other aminoglycosides and beta-lactams, was studied against clinical isolates collected from pediatric patients during a period of May 1986-April 1987. 1. GM-resistance was noted in 22% of Staphylococcus aureus, 6% of Proteus vulgaris, 8% of Morganella morganii, 40% of Providencia spp., 6% of Enterobacter spp., 14% of Serratia marcescens, and 14% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. No GM-resistance was observed with isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. 2. The antibacterial activity of GM against clinical isolates from pediatric patients was found to be comparable to its activity against clinical isolates from adults studied at the same time. 3. The majority of GM-resistant strains of S. aureus were MCRSA, and the GM-resistant strains of S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa were found also to be resistant to multiple drugs. 4. GM-resistant strains were found at relatively high rates (14-22%) in S. aureus, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa. These rates did not increase compared to the rates observed in the first half of the 1980's. 5. GM was considered to have poor antibacterial activity against genus Providencia. It is concluded from above results that GM still maintains effective antibacterial activity against many of causative organisms of infections in both adults and children.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a difluoroquinolone 3-carboxylic acid, compared with those of other quinolones.
AB  - Lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198) is a new difluoroquinolone agent. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Aeromonas spp., Yersinia spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin inhibited 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was equal in activity to norfloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but was twofold less active against Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. Ofloxacin was generally 2- to 4-fold more active, and ciprofloxacin was 4- to 16-fold more active. Lomefloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but MICs for 90% of streptococcal species tested were 8 micrograms/ml. In the presence of 9 mM Mg2+, MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were increased, as they were when they were tested in urine. A single-step increase in resistance to eightfold above the MIC occurred at a frequency of less than 10(-10), but serial transfer of bacteria in the presence of the agent produced MIC increases. Lomefloxacin had activity and properties comparable to those of many of the new quinolones.
TI  - Activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against Staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. E-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. In general, E-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs giving 90% inhibition for E-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of E-3846 increased at acid pH; in contrast, acid pH caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In vivo, E-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
TI  - Microbial keratitis associated with contaminated ocular medications.
AB  - We studied seven cases of severe gram-negative microbial keratitis associated with the use of contaminated topical ocular medications. Five cases involved Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one involved Serratia marcescens, and one involved Proteus mirabilis. In each case the same organism was cultured from corneal scrapings and from the medication. Either prednisolone acetate (one case) or timolol maleate (seven cases) was implicated in all instances.
TI  - New plate medium for screening and presumptive identification of gram-negative urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - A new selective, differential plating medium to screen the common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens is described. The medium combines adonitol fermentation, phenylalanine deaminase, and beta-glucuronidase tests and allows the indole and cytochrome oxidase tests to be performed directly from the plates. High-level agreement with individual conventional tests was recorded in comparative studies with 504 cultures of gram-negative rods. There was 100% agreement, except for the Providencia spp. indole spot test (61.6% agreement). Adonitol fermentation by Providencia species could not be determined. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified with a high efficiency (100, 85.7, 83.5, and 100% agreement, respectively) without further testing. There was 96% overall agreement for the 267 infected urine samples tested.
TI  - A survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. Drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the United States. Data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. The unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. The duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). Predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). Signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. Pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. In 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. After treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. Of 411 isolates of P. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 Escherichia coli and 80% of 248 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Also eradicated were 95% of 166 Klebsiella, 96% of 139 Proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other Proteus, 94% of 123 Enterobacter, 100% of 68 Haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 Citrobacter, 89% of 45 Serratia, 95% of 41 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 Salmonella, 100% of 38 Morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 Providencia isolates. Adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. The most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated SGOT, SGPT, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). Crystalluria, judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Interactions between antibacterial agents of the quinolone group and nitrofurantoin.
AB  - Plate diffusion tests showed that nitrofurantoin antagonized the activity of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against many Gram-negative bacilli, including all Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella aerogenes strains tested. No interaction was exhibited when nitrofurantoin and the newer quinolones were tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci or streptococci. Antagonism was not reliably demonstrated in chessboard titrations, especially with the newer quinolones. Continuous turbidimetric monitoring revealed that antagonism in Pr. mirabilis was associated with abolition of the bacteriolytic response to quinolones and parallel viable counts established that the bactericidal effect of quinolones was suppressed. Apparent potentiation of the effect of nitrofurantoin by nalidixic acid and other quinolones against Pr. mirabilis appeared to be caused by inhibition of swarming into the nitrofurantoin inhibition zone.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefotetan in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The authors studied 302 hospitalized patients, 164 males and 138 females aged 15-88 years (average 66 years), with severe infections. Cefotetan was administered to 278 of them at the dose of 1 or 2 g, b.i.d. or a single daily dose i.m. Other patients [24] were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of cefotetan (3 g daily in 5% dextrose). Of these patients 121 were treated for urinary tract infections (UTI); 114 for respiratory tract infections (RTI); 41 for liver biliary duct infections (BDI); 17 for skin or skin structure infections (SKI); 6 for fever of unknown origin and 3 for sepsis. The following Gram-positive organisms [156] were isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group D; and the following Gram-negative organisms [122]: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 74% and for Gram-negative organisms it was 88%. The clinical response was satisfactory in 87.7% of patients (specifically, cefotetan was effective in 90% of UTI, 84.2% of RTI, 97.5% of BDI and 82.3% of SKI). The drug was well tolerated and side-effects (such as skin rash, diarrhoea, purpura and pain at the site of injection) occurred in only 4% of patients treated with cefotetan. In conclusion, cefotetan appears to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing of broad-spectrum antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Time-kill studies and synergy testing were performed with blood culture isolates  from 80 patients with septicemia. Ten isolates each of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were included. The isolates were tested against netilmicin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime, alone and in different combinations. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against Enterobacteriaceae, whereas netilmicin was the most active agent against P. aeruginosa and staphylococci. The most active antibiotic combinations were netilmicin-cefotaxime and netilmicin-piperacillin, where a synergistic activity was observed in 68 and 61%, respectively. The highest synergistic activity was against Enterobacteriaceae, but the netilmicin-cefotaxime combination also acted synergistically against more than half of the S. aureus isolates. A relatively low synergistic activity was noted against P. aeruginosa. No case of antagonism was observed. Subinhibitory concentrations of netilmicin, in combination with a greater than or equal to MIC concentration of one of the tested beta-lactam antibiotics, significantly improved the killing of the isolates. Netilmicin exerted a more rapid and pronounced bacterial reduction than the beta-lactam antibiotics tested.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Antibacterial activity after a single-dose of norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pipemidic acid detected in urine of volunteers.
AB  - Six healthy volunteers received in a triple-crossover design a single oral dose of norfloxacin, ofloxacin or pipemidic acid. Urine samples were collected during the 24 h following the administration and were tested for inhibitory and bactericidal activity against selected strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Norfloxacin and ofloxacin inhibited the urinary growth of sensitive strains during the 24 h of sampling time at dilutions much higher than those generally considered satisfactory. Nalidixic acid was less effective and did not achieve bactericidal activity against Ps. aeruginosa over the interval of 12 to 24 h.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime alone and in combination against 320 gram-negative clinical isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime and its intermediate metabolite, desacetylcefotaxime, against 320 Gram-negative bacterial strains was analysed to investigate whether combination of the 2 substances led to increased bactericidal activity. The in vitro study of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) showed the combination to be more effective against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp. and Proteus mirabilis, requiring less than or equal to 50% of the concentration of cefotaxime alone to inhibit 90% of strains. For other micro-organisms the MIC90 for the combination was equal to or within 1 dilution of that for cefotaxime alone.
TI  - A regional survey of the resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of (facultative) aerobic micro-organisms.
AB  - From 1980 to 1986 a regional survey was performed to investigate the susceptibility of beta-lactam antibiotics in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 6 hospitals located in the southern part of the Netherlands. Each year 300 to 400 strains were tested. The susceptibility to representatives of the older and the newer beta-lactam antibiotics was determined by a microbroth dilution assay using an inoculum size of 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml in ISO-Sensitest broth (Oxoid). No significant differences in antibiotic sensitivity of the micro-organisms from the different hospitals were found. There was no evidence for an increase in antibiotic resistance of the strains during the sampling period. In contrast, there was a general tendency to an increase in antibiotic sensitivity.

TI  - Antitumor effect of normal intestinal microflora on Ehrlich ascites tumor.
AB  - In order to investigate the antitumor activity of intestinal microflora, the constitution of normal flora was examined in humans, guinea pigs and mice. It was clarified that Eubacterium, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides were the predominant bacterial genera in humans. In addition, neither Clostridium nor Enterobacteriaceae was detected in guinea pigs and neither Clostridium nor Bifidobacterium was present in mice. Total bacterial counts in tumor-bearing mice were reduced in comparison with those in normal mice. Especially, in the ileum of tumor-bearing mice, the incidence of anaerobic bacterial genera was strikingly decreased. From the bacteria found, 59 living and killed strains isolated from intestinal microflora were examined for antitumor activity against Ehrlich ascites tumor. It was observed that 11 of the tested strains had antitumor activity. Four of these were toxic to the host, and in particular, all mice injected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (TYM-8) died within several days. Eubacterium lentum (TYH-11), Propionibacterium acnes (TYM-28), Proteus mirabilis (TYM-7) and Serratia marcescens (TY-142), in which antitumor activity was recognized with living and formalin-killed bacteria, cured the tumor-bearing mice, and the culture supernatant of S. marcescens contained apparent antitumor activity.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial activities of temafloxacin hydrochloride (A-62254) and  two reference fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo properties of a new 1-difluorophenyl-6-fluoroquinolone,  temafloxacin hydrochloride (A-62254), were compared with those of difloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Temafloxacin hydrochloride was as active as ciprofloxacin and difloxacin against staphylococci and as active as ciprofloxacin and 2 twofold dilutions more active than difloxacin against streptococci. Against gram-negative enteric bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, temafloxacin hydrochloride was 2 twofold dilutions more active than difloxacin but 2 to 4 twofold dilutions less active than ciprofloxacin. The MICs of temafloxacin hydrochloride and difloxacin were increased by 2 to 5 twofold dilutions in urine at pH 6.5 compared with 4 to 5 twofold-dilution increases in the MICs of ciprofloxacin. The MICs of temafloxacin hydrochloride, difloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were increased by 1 to 3 twofold dilutions in serum. The MICs of temafloxacin hydrochloride, difloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were the same or within 1 to 2 twofold dilutions at pHs 6.5, 7.2, and 8.0. When administered orally in mouse protection tests, temafloxacin hydrochloride was as active as difloxacin and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against infections with Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci. Against infections with gram-negative enteric bacteria and P. aeruginosa, temafloxacin hydrochloride was as active as difloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Temafloxacin hydrochloride was three times less active than difloxacin but was five times more active than ciprofloxacin against infections with Salmonella typhimurium. Temafloxacin hydrochloride was as active as difloxacin and ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis pyelonephritis in mice. The peak serum concentration and serum half-life of temafloxacin hydrochloride in mice were approximately one-half and one-sixth, respectively, that of difloxacin after oral administration. The peak serum concentration of temafloxacin hydrochloride in mice after oral administration was six times higher than that of ciprofloxacin, and the serum half-life was equal to that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of sisomicin (SISO) against clinical isolates obtained in the second half of 1986 were investigated together with other 4 aminoglycosides (AGs) (gentamicin (GM), tobramycin (TOB), dibekacin (DKB), amikacin (AMK] and 2 cephems (cefotiam, cefotaxime), and were compared to the results reported in the period of late 1970's through early 1980's in Japan. 1. The incidence of SISO-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the present study was 18% and is comparable to that of the other studies suggesting that the incidence of SISO resistant strains remains on the stable level. The incidence of SISO-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the tendency of slight increase. 2. SISO-resistant strains of Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii did not show increase from the 1970/1980 levels. 3. Isolation rates of SISO-resistant indole(+) Proteus varied depending on strains. Isolation rates of SISO-resistant P. vulgaris and Morganella morganii were both as low as 4%, but that of Providencia rettgeri was as high as 60%. Refering to an American study reporting that the Genus Providencia including P. rettgeri showed high incidence of resistance to SISO as well as to GM or TOB, we pointed out that the antimicrobial activity of AGs against Genus Providencia should be evaluated separately from those of other indole(+) Proteus strains. 4. No SISO-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or P. mirabilis were found. 5. SISO had good antimicrobial activity against most of the investigated species and SISO may still be regarded as one of the clinically useful AGs.
TI  - R-plasmid RP1 promotes adhesion of gram-negative bacteria to medical prostheses and glass.
AB  - The presence of R-plasmid RP1 increased the adhesion of chemostat-grown iron- and carbon-limited Proteus mirabilis to the surfaces of various medical prostheses and to glass. Similar results were obtained with iron-limited Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobically-grown Escherichia coli. Changes in the surface properties of P. mirabilis indicated that the R-plasmid-mediated increase in negative charge was one of the factors that promoted adhesion.
TI  - Assessment of antiseptic bladder washout procedures using a physical model of the catheterised bladder.
AB  - A simple physical model of the catheterised bladder has been used to assess the activities of antiseptic agents that have been recommended as bladder instillations in the treatment of urinary tract infections in patients with indwelling catheters. The activities of povidone-iodine, phenoxyethanol, chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine supplemented with EDTA + Tris, noxythiolin and neomycin were examined against selected species of uropathogens. Except for phenoxyethanol against Pv. stuartii and possibly Ps. aeruginosa, single applications of these antibacterials for 30 min were not effective in sterilising urine in the artificial bladder. However, a second application 1 h later of phenoxyethanol but not chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine did eradicate Ps. aeruginosa. It is suggested that bacteria growing as a film on the bladder wall are particularly resistant to antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. It  inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of sulbactam/cefoperazone. Comparison with other new cephems].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) against 50 fresh clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were compared to those of CPZ, Cefotiam (CTM), Cefotaxime (CTX) and Latamoxef (LMOX). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of SBT and CPZ mixed in a ratio of 1:1 were determined by the dilution method using Mueller-Hinton agar and expressed by absolute concentrations of CPZ. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/CPZ against principally penicillinase (PCase) producing bacteria, i.e., S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, were superior to those of CPZ alone. The presence of SBT in concentrations around 0.39 approximately 1.56 micrograms/ml clearly enhanced CPZ's antimicrobial activities against these PCase producing strains. The synergistic antimicrobial effects of SBT in combination with CPZ were less pronounced against principally cephalosporinase (CEPase) producing bacteria, i.e., C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris, and P. aeruginosa, and exerted with SBT at concentrations around 3.13 approximately 12.5 micrograms/ml. Comparative antimicrobial activities indicated by MIC80's of tested agents showed that SBT/CPZ had more stable activities against bacteria ranging from Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria than CTM, CTX and LMOX. MIC's of SBT/CPZ were higher than 25 micrograms/ml against 8% of S. aureus, 18% of C. freundii, 10% of Enterobacter spp., 26% of S. marcescens, 2% of P. vulgaris, and 18% of P. aeruginosa. These resistant strains against which the addition of SBT showed no synergism, may possess other mechanism of resistance than beta-lactamase production. It is concluded that the presence of CPZ resistant strains is an actual current problem and not an imaginary future problem, and that the number of resistant strains against other new cephems which have different chemical structure from CPZ is increasing. When these present bacteriological environments are considered, the appearance of SBT/CPZ in the clinical practice is timely and meaningful.
TI  - The penicillins.
AB  - The penicillin family of antibiotics is ever expanding and remains an important part of our antimicrobial armamentarium. These medications generally have bactericidal activity, excellent distribution throughout the body, low toxicity, and efficacy against infections due to susceptible organisms. The clinical introduction of aqueous penicillin G for treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections was an important pharmacologic landmark. The emergence of penicillinase-producing staphylococci prompted the development of the penicillinase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, nafcillin, and others), in which the acyl side chain prevented disruption of the beta-lactamase ring. The aminopenicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, and others) were later developed because of the need for gram-negative antimicrobial activity. Their spectrum included Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella, Salmonella, Listeria, and Haemophilus. The search for a penicillin with even further antimicrobial activity against the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa led to the development of the carboxypenicillins, ureidopenicillins, and piperazine penicillins. Recently, the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid or sulbactam) and an amino-penicillin or ticarcillin has resulted in further extension of their antibacterial spectra. The development of an ideal penicillin that is nonsensitizing, bioavailable, beta-lactamase-resistant, rapidly bactericidal, nontoxic, and inexpensive and that has high affinity to penicillin-binding proteins and no inoculum effect remains the goal.
TI  - Susceptibility of gentamicin sensitive and resistant gram negative bacilli to ceftazidime.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was compared with other third-generation cephalosporins and gentamicin against 409 isolates. Ceftazidime was the most active agent against Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia sp., Proteus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was less active against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella than moxalactam and cefotaxime but more active than cefoperazone. Against gentamicin resistant E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and P. aeruginosa, ceftazidime was more active than moxalactam, cefotaxime or cefoperazone but was as active as moxalactam against gentamicin-resistant Proteus sp. and more active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
TI  - The resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  - Isolates of Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with Escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. All species survived the antiseptic. Organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. The effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. Examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. We conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.

TI  - [Study of the sensitivity to pipemidic acid, pefloxacin and norfloxacin of 444 bacterial strains isolated at a general hospital].
AB  - After one year of use of pefloxacin in the intensive care unit, medicine unit and surgery unit and the following recent commercialization without prescription of norfloxacin, we studied for a period of two months (april and may 1986) the susceptibility to pipemidic acid, to pefloxacin and norfloxacin of 444 bacteria strains isolated obtained from clinical specimens. The antibiotic susceptibility is determined by disk diffusion test. We obtained the following results: susceptible methicillin Staphylococcus aureus (SMSA 63 strains): 85.7% PEFS, 11.1% PEFI, 79.4% NORS, 15.9% NORI, resistant methicillin Staphylococcus aureus (RMSA 36 strains): 33.3% PEFS, 2.9% PEFI, 41.6% NORS, 0% NORI; Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (252 strains): 94% PIPS, 94.8% PEFS, 97.2% NORS; Enterobacter, Proteus indol (+), Providencia and Citrobacter (33 strains): 72.7% PIPS, 72.7% PEFS, 84.8% NORS; Pseudomonas aeruginosa (53 strains): 32% PEFS, 47.2% PEFI, 90.6% NORS, 5.6% NORI; Acinetobacter (7 strains): 57.2% PEFS, 42.8% PEFI, 42.8% NORS, 28.6% NORI. Norfloxacin in active in vitro against the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolated. We found an important methicillin and pefloxacin resistance among the Staphylococcus aureus isolated: 36 strains RMSA (36.4% out of Staphylococcus aureus) and 23 strains RMSA PEFR (63.8% out of RMSA). These later strains were isolated in eight different units mainly in visceral surgery unit and geriatric units but not in intensive care unit. After an epidemiologic study and the following recommendations to physicians and nurses: treatment by pefloxacin should be used only after bacteriological results and associated with an other antibiotic, the handwashing should be frequent and regular to prevent the spread of infection, four months later we isolated 26 strains of RMSA with 7 RMSA PEF (26.9%).2$
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of diethyldithiocarbamate and dimethyldithiocarbamate against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus has appeared which is highly resistant to both methicillin  and aminoglycosides. Current therapy involves long-term intravenous therapy of vancomycin. Since vancomycin is currently the only drug used to treat these patients, there is a need to develop additional antimicrobial therapy. The in vitro antimicrobial effect of the metal chelator, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) and its structural analog dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMTC) were investigated. Both DDTC and DMTC were effective against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). By agar diffusion, DDTC at 10 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 12 to 21 mm and at 100 micrograms per disk produced zone sizes of 26 to 34 mm against MRSA. The DMTC produced slightly greater zone sizes against MRSA of 16 to 24 mm and 24 to 37 mm for 10 micrograms per disk and 100 micrograms per disk, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for DMTC against MRSA was 6 micrograms per ml. Both DDTC and DMTC were also effective against enterococci, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii at 100 micrograms per disk. The MICs of DMTC for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Citrobacter freundii were approximately 128 micrograms per ml while the MICs for Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens was greater than or equal to 256 micrograms per ml. In addition, DMTC was synergistic with gentamicin against MRSA and coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additive and synergistic effects of DMTC were displayed with gentamicin against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The post-antibiotic suppressive effect (PAE) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. Recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a PAE against gram-negative bacteria. In this study, the PAEs of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis were determined. The differences in PAE determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for S. aureus and E. coli. Ciprofloxacin had a PAE by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. A ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in Mueller-Hinton broth, pH 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a PAE of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for S. aureus, but had no effect on S. faecalis. Exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour PAE for E. coli, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. Use of Mueller-Hinton broth with a magnesium concentration of 8 mM, pH 5.5, yielded similar results. Using human serum, a four-hour PAE was found for P. aeruginosa. There was a progressive increase in the PAE as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from 0.9 hours to three hours. Increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for P. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the MBC for E. coli did not cause a significant difference in the PAE using a two-hour exposure. Overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent PAE for most gram-negative bacteria and for S. aureus, but not for S. faecalis. A PAE caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the pH adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. These results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment of tissue and urinary infections.
TI  - Use of intravenous ciprofloxacin in difficult-to-treat infections.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin was administered to 54 patients who were either critically ill or in whom oral administration was not possible. The 31 males and 23 females ranged in age from 20 to 89 years (mean, 53.2 +/- 17.8 years). Patients had "difficult-to-treat" infections, i.e., respiratory infections (15), abscesses (four intraabdominal, three lung, two soft tissue, and one intrahepatic), deep soft tissue infections (10), chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (nine), upper urinary tract infection (five), malignant external otitis (two), catheter-related bacteremia (two), and infectious endocarditis (one). Thirty patients (56 percent) had serious associated medical problems. Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38 isolates), Acinetobacter species (10 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (eight isolates), Escherichia coli (two isolates), Proteus mirabilis (one isolate), Kingella kingae (one isolate), Bacteroides fragilis (eight isolates), and Peptostreptococcus species (five isolates). Minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.003 to 2 micrograms/ml. In 39 patients, the isolated microorganisms were multi-resistant; resistance included ceftazidime and amikacin in 32 patients. In 24 patients, ciprofloxacin was given exclusively by the intravenous route at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours; in 30 patients, treatment was completed after discontinuation of the parenteral drug with the oral preparation of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours. The duration of parenteral treatment ranged from six to 40 days (mean, 14.9 days). A successful clinical response was observed in 49 patients (91 percent), while five (9 percent) failed to show a response. Bacteriologic outcomes were as follows: eradication of pathogen in 33 patients (61.1 percent), persistence in 18 (33.3 percent), and relapse in three (5.6 percent), with development of resistance to ciprofloxacin in nine patients (16.7 percent) and superinfection in two patients (3.7 percent). Side effects included vein irritation at the site of the infusion (three patients), abnormal elevation in liver enzyme levels (two patients), reversible renal failure (one patient), and nausea (one patient). Parenteral ciprofloxacin is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective therapy for the critically ill patient, and can be replaced with the oral form when clinically appropriate.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin therapy for gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.
AB  - The efficacy and toxicity of ciprofloxacin, an orally administered fluoroquinolone, were evaluated in 24 infections in 23 patients with osteomyelitis caused by aerobic gram-negative bacilli. The diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and the results of bone biopsy and culture of bone or deep soft tissue. The aerobic gram-negative bacilli were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15 isolates), Serratia marcescens (five isolates), Escherichia coli (three isolates), Enterobacter species (three isolates), Proteus mirabilis (one isolate), Pseudomonas fluorescens (one isolate), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one isolate). Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 1.56 micrograms/ml or less for all but one isolate. Nine infections were polymicrobial, involving aerobic gram-positive cocci or anaerobes in addition to aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Additional antibiotics to which the aerobic gram-negative bacilli were resistant were given when the additional organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Patients received 750 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily for a mean of 62 days. Peak serum levels of ciprofloxacin were at least threefold higher than the MBCs in 20 of 24 patients. Twenty of 22 infections in which a full course of therapy was completed were without evidence of active disease at one to 17 months posttreatment. A sternotomy wound infection relapsed after eight weeks of therapy with a newly resistant S. marcescens strain, and an infection of a compound fracture relapsed two months posttreatment with a still sensitive P. aeruginosa strain. Toxicity was minimal in most patients: eosinophilia (six patients), nausea (eight patients), mild elevation in transaminase levels (three patients), pruritus (one patient), diarrhea (two patients), thrush (two patients), rash (two patients), and mild leukopenia (one patient). Two additional patients had severe side effects (vertigo in one and acute renal failure in another) that required discontinuation of ciprofloxacin therapy. Overall, ciprofloxacin is a promising agent for the oral treatment of gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis.
TI  - [Recent trend of childhood bacterial meningitis in Japan (1979-1984). Part 4. A classification of prognosis and antibiotic treatment based on causative agents].
AB  - Nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in Japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. The number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (AGs) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-AGs antibiotics including beta-lactam (Non AGs) was observed. A trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (CFR) was observed except that CFR for Gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + AGs remained at a same level. Cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. Cases with Staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, CFR was 28.6% (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + AGs and 37.5% (3/8) with beta-lactam + Non AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 100 cases of group B Streptococcus (GBS), CFR was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + AGs (P less than 0.1). Among 198 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, CFR was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. CFR for the cases treated with beta-lactam + AGs was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + Non AGs was 3.6% (1/28) (P less than 0.1). CFR for 292 cases of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + AGs and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam + Non AGs, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. Among 111 cases of Escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + Non AGs gave 6.5% (2/31) CFR, and 5.6% (1/18) CFR, respectively, whereas beta-lactam + AGs showed CFR of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (P less than 0.1). Similar tendencies were observed in the cases of Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Contrary to the high CFR observed with the beta-lactam + AGs treatment, significantly low CFR was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. Infections with GBS, E. coli, and P. mirabilis occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and CFR was especially high in the very young.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - [Etiology of corneal ulcers with special reference to bacterial genesis].
AB  - The authors report on 134 patients (141 eyes) seen between May 1982 and December  1985 with corneal ulcers with or without hypopyon. Eight patients (11 eyes) had a facial palsy, 7 (7 eyes) a varicella zoster infection, 1 (2 eyes) a marginal ulcer ("furrow keratitis") associated with collagenosis, 29 (29 eyes) an ulcerative keratitis with endophthalmitis, 1 (2 eyes) a pemphigoid-associated ulcer and 90 (92 eyes) a herpetic infection. Pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated from 20 patients: 10 coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (4 coinfections), 3 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 coinfection), 2 Proteus mirabilis (1 coinfection), 2 Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and beta-hemolyzing streptococci as well as enterococci in one case each, and non-hemolyzing streptococci and alpha-hemolyzing streptococci in two cases each as coinfections. A comparison of the range of bacterial strains of postoperative endophthalmitis and kerato-/conjunctivitis with bacterial corneal ulcers revealed a high percentage of gram-negative organisms in the latter. Laboratory work-up should include microscopy, agar plating and differentiation as well as antibiotic sensitivity testing and modern immunofluorescent direct techniques. Management includes bactericidal topical and systemic antibiotic regimens as well as surgical procedures if necessary, e.g., perforating tectonic and mini-keratoplasty, and conjunctival flapping followed by lamellar keratoplasty.
TI  - Purple urine bag syndrome.
AB  - Purple pigment extracted from the urinary catheters and collecting bags of two elderly female patients was analysed by a variety of chemical techniques, including mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Although previous studies identified the pigment as indigo, we failed to confirm this. Our analysis also demonstrated that indicanuria is not a requirement for the production of the pigment and furthermore indicates that the molecular structure of the pigment is either a steroidal or bile acid conjugate.
TI  - In-vitro bacterial killing kinetics of ticarcillin/clavulanic acid.
AB  - An in-vitro model was developed to study the rates of killing by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combinations of various beta-lactamase producing, ticarcillin resistant, logarithmic phase clinical isolates. Killing, defined as a 3 log reduction, was dependent on the organism, the concentration of clavulanic acid and the duration of exposure. For most isolates studied an optimum period of exposure to and concentration of clavulanic acid could be defined. Certain test strains showed optimum response to readily attainable in-vivo concentrations of clavulanic acid while other strains, although sensitive by MIC data showed a poor response. The clinical implications of this are discussed.
TI  - In-vitro anti-microbial susceptibility of clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria to ten antibiotics including phosphomycin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ten antibiotics was determined for  various bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical specimens in a Lagos hospital. The in-vitro activity of penicillin and tetracycline was not very impressive and a similarity was noticed in the resistance patterns of these two antibiotics, while the activity in vitro of the relatively more toxic aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol was high for Gram-negative rods. Ceftazidime demonstrated the highest activity in vitro against all pathogens studied. Cefoxitin, cefuroxime and phosphomycin demonstrated an impressive activity in vitro. Clindamycin was very active against strains of Staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactamase production amongst these strains was studied and the clinical significance of this and their MIC results are discussed.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children. Status in a pediatric hospital and sensitivity of bacterial strains to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid combination].
AB  - Three hundred bacterial strains from positive urine cultures were isolated over a 10 months period in paediatric hospitalized and out-patients. In addition to commonly used antibiotics, each strain was tested for amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (Augmentin, Beecham) susceptibility. This antibiotic, which is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta lactamases, may be of interest in the treatment of urinary tract infections because of its pharmacokinetics and activity. The antibacterial activity of amoxycillin and Augmentin against Enterobacteriaceae with special reference to Escherichia coli was compared. The resistance phenotype of Enterobacteriaceae to amoxycillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin allows to anticipate the nature of the beta-lactamase produced by a particular strain, and infer the activity of Augmentin. The overall activity of Augmentin should be interpreted taking into account the resistance phenotypes. In our study, Augmentin was active against 90% of E. coli strains, almost all Proteus mirabilis and vulgaris strains but 9 out of 24 Klebsiella strains were resistant. Augmentin had no activity against nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, nor against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. On the other hand, its activity was of interest against penicillinase producing Staphylococcus. Our results confirm the interest of Augmentin as a preferential treatment of urinary tract infections in children.
TI  - Worldwide study of cefoperazone susceptibility.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility to cefoperazone of more than one million clinical aerobic bacterial isolates was evaluated in 369 hospitals in Japan, the United States, Canada, France, Austria, and Hungary. Standard versions of the disk diffusion method were used according to interpretive criteria approved in the respective countries, and comparisons were made among the countries and among various body sites. Susceptibility of organisms varied little within most species among the countries. Minor differences in methodology and in interpretive criteria may explain some of the variations observed among countries and hospitals. The susceptibility of key pathogens to cefoperazone among countries ranged from 91% to 98% for Escherichia coli, 73% to 91% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% to 95% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 73% to 92% for Enterobacter cloacae, 74% to 92% for Staphylococcus aureus, and 91% to 97% for Proteus mirabilis. Susceptibility of isolates from the urinary tract did not vary markedly from that in other body sites.
TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance at a hospital environment. Observations from 1980 to 1986].
AB  - A total of 1659 bacteria Strains were examined for susceptibility to different drugs by the Kirby-Bauer method. The isolates came from the General Medicine ward of Castellamonte's hospital (USSL 40). The results were retrospectively studied and statistically elaborated. The study lasted from 2 to 7 years depending on the antibiotic considered. The isolates included: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus IND+, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis. Penicillines, Cefalosporines, Aminoglycosides, Quinolones, Tetraciclines, Nitrofurantoin, Macrolides, Rifampins, Lincosides and peptide antibiotics were tested. The results of this study can be useful for the choice of the antibiotics in non-specific therapy of infectious diseases and show the frequency of isolation of resistant strains from hospitalized patients. Furthermore it would be important to constitute a regional-epidemiological centre of Infectious Diseases.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of oral ofloxacin in treating various infections.
AB  - 66 patients were given daily doses of ofloxacin between 400 and 800 mg for 10 days to 6 months. They were suffering from exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (15), soft tissue phlegmon (11), complicated urinary tract infections (7), bronchopneumonia (7), chronic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (8), chronic prostatitis in exacerbation (5), lower urinary tract infections (3), chronic otitis media (3), acute otitis (3), acute bronchitis (1), lung abscess (2) or liver abscess (1). Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24), Haemophilus influenzae (16), Proteus mirabilis (6), Escherichia coli (6), Enterobacter cloacae (6), Providencia stuartii (2), Serratia marcescens (2), Citrobacter diversus (1), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). In 35 patients (53%), several aggravating factors coexisted. MICs of ofloxacin ranged from less than or equal to 0.06 to 2 mg/L. Clinically, 65% of the patients were considered as cured, 17% improved and 18% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 62%, persisted in 16% and relapsed in 22%. Adverse reactions included gastrointestinal disturbances (4), rash plus facial oedema (1), abnormal liver function (2) and leucopenia (1).
TI  - Reactions of hemocytes of immune and non-immune Galleria mellonella larvae to Proteus mirabilis.
AB  - Immune larval Galleria mellonella removed live Proteus mirabilis from the hemolymph less effectively than did non-immune larvae. This was attributed to a decline in total hemocyte counts, levels of plasmatocytes and granulocytes and hemocyte adhesion capacity. Immune serum possessed factors which reduced bacterial adhesion to the hemocytes. This was not due to altering bacterial surfaces but rather to irreversible suppression of hemocyte activity.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of Ro 23-6240, a new fluorinated 4-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of Ro 23-6240 was assessed and compared with  those of ciprofloxacin and beta-lactam antibiotics including several oral compounds against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (n = 130) and Pseudomonas spp. (n = 31). In general, Ro 23-6240 was 2 dilution steps less active than ciprofloxacin. For the Pseudomonas spp. the MICs for 90% inhibition were 2 and 0.5 mg/1 for Ro 23-6240 and ciprofloxacin, respectively. For the other species tested, the MIC90 values for Ro 23-6240 ranged from 0.031 to 1 mg/1 and for ciprofloxacin from 0.016 to 0.25 mg/1. Spontaneous Ro 23-6240-resistant mutants were only isolated from Enterobacter cloacae with a frequency similar to that of ciprofloxacin (4.8 X 10(-8) and 2.4 X 10(-8), respectively). No resistant mutants were isolated from Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of 4 and 8 times the MIC of Ro 23-6240 or ciprofloxacin (frequency less than 10(-9).
TI  - Bacterial isolation from and transmission by Boophilus decoloratus and Boophilus  geigyi.
AB  - Bacteria were isolated from the haemolymph of Boophilus decoloratus and Boophilus geigyi which had engorged on trade cattle in Nigeria. All the genera of the bacteria were also isolated from the eggs which they laid although some of them were missing from the larvae which eventually hatched. When clean rabbits were inoculated with some genera of bacteria and clean, laboratory bred larvae of B. decoloratus and B. geigyi fed on them, the same genera of bacteria were subsequently isolated from the haemolymph of the engorged adults, the eggs they produced and the larvae which hatched from them. Staphylococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were consistently encountered in the haemolymph, eggs and larvae of both Boophilus species while Proteus mirabilis was additionally consistent in B. geigyi.
TI  - The effect of the combination of erythromycin with new beta-lactam antibiotics against gram-negative aerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin on the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, cefmenoxime, aztreonam, imipenem, piperacillin, and gentamicin against 89 bacteria isolated from sputum and tracheal aspirates of patients admitted to intensive care units was evaluated. There were 30 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 5 Escherichia coli, 4 Enterobacter aerogenes, 3 each of Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, 2 each of Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter anitratus; 1 Proteus mirabilis. All isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Organisms were screened for synergy by fixed erythromycin concentration at 1, 8 and 16 micrograms/ml. There were 16 isolates that showed a greater than four-fold difference in MICs. These strains were analyzed by the checkerboard broth method. No antagonism was seen for any drug combination with erythromycin. One Enterobacter cloacae showed synergy of ceftizoxime and erythromycin, and 1 E. cloacae showed synergy with cefotaxime. Addition was found for 2 P. aeruginosa, 1 each E. aerogenes, E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens. At concentrations of erythromycin achievable in blood or pulmonary tissue, the activity of newer beta-lactams and gentamicin is not altered by erythromycin.
TI  - Imipenem as monotherapy in the treatment of intensive care patients with severe infections.
AB  - In an open study, 24 intensive care patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin as monotherapy for serious bacterial infections. Twenty-one patients were treated for bronchopulmonary infection, two patients for septicaemia, and one patient for an empyema. Initially all strains were susceptible to imipenem. Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 80% of these isolates. The most frequently isolated species were Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All 24 patients were considered clinically cured. Sixteen of these patients (67%) were both clinically and microbiologically cured. In eight of the 24 patients (33%), the strains isolated initially persisted. In eight of the 24 patients (33%), colonization of the respiratory tract developed. Two of the five Ps. aeruginosa isolates developed resistance during therapy but in none of these patients was therapy considered to have failed. In 12 patients (50%), transient elevations in hepatic function tests were observed and these were probably drug-related. The present study supports the view that imipenem/cilastatin may be useful as monotherapy in the treatment of severe infections in intensive care patients.
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had significant underlying disease. There were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. The pathogens were: Escherichia coli, 7 (mean MIC 0.07 mg/l); Serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); Enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); Proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); Cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), Staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of Acinetobacter anitratus. Haemophilus, influenzae, Salmonella enteritidis, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, and Streptococcus faecalis. Of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70% to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to cotrimoxazole. Ten patients had concomitant Ps. aeruginosa infections. Patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. The overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if Ps. aeruginosa is included. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one Staph. aureus and one Ser. marcescens (MIC greater than 2 mg/l). Toxicity was minor. Ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - Use of aztreonam in patients suffering from urinary tract infections with contraindications for the use of aminoglycosides.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of aztreonam were studied in 30 patients suffering from urinary tract infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. Aztreonam was given in a dose of 1 g i.m. at intervals of 12 or 24 hours. Duration of therapy was 2-8 days. Bacteria isolated in urine cultures were: Escherichia coli (60%); Proteus mirabilis (10%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp. (7%); Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas species (3%). At completion of therapy and at follow-up all patients were bacteriologically and clinically cured. No significant side effects or toxicity were observed in all patients treated. It is concluded from these data that aztreonam is highly effective and well tolerated in patients affected either by upper or lower urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Guidelines for testing and rating hand decontamination preparations].
AB  
TI  - Characterization of a protein from normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes with bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Purification of a bactericidal protein (BP) from the cytoplasmic granules of normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is described. Bactericidal activity from acid extracts of a mixed granule population was purified 175-fold by a two-step chromatographic procedure. The first step, dye-ligand affinity chromatography with Matrex-Gel Orange A, was followed by cation-exchange chromatography with Bio-Rex 70 resin, and this combination routinely gave a yield near 80%. Only one peak of bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa type I was found after each chromatographic step. Characterization of BP showed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified BP was most active against the six strains of P. aeruginosa tested and against Escherichia coli B (a deep rough mutant). Purified BP killed 5 X 10(6) CFU of P. aeruginosa type I per ml at a concentration of 60 to 80 ng/ml. Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus were both resistant to the bactericidal activity of BP. BP was shown to be glycosylated by periodic acid staining after gel electrophoresis and to have an isoelectric point near 7.5 by chromatofocusing. The amino acid composition of BP is presented.
TI  - Late intraphagosomal hydrogen ion concentration favors the in vitro antimicrobial capacity of a 37-kilodalton cationic granule protein of human neutrophil granulocytes.
AB  - We described previously (W.M. Shafer, L.E. Martin, and J.K. Spitznagel, Infect. Immun. 45:29-35, 1984) the presence of a 37-kilodalton cationic antimicrobial protein (37K CAP) in extracts of granules prepared from human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN). In this investigation, we prepared 37K CAP from PMN granule extracts by sequential ion-exchange and molecular-sieve chromatography and examined its antimicrobial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. At concentrations of 5 micrograms/ml or lower, 37K CAP exerted selective antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria included Acinetobacter lwoffii, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella sonnei. However, at 5 micrograms of 37K CAP per ml, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens resisted this antimicrobial activity. The bactericidal activity of 37K CAP was greatest in acidic (pH 5.5) as opposed to alkaline (pH 7.5) media. The level of S. typhimurium resistance to 37K CAP correlated with the presence of O antigen in the lipopolysaccharide. In the absence of O antigen repeat units, resistance was proportional to the length of the core oligosaccharide. These results suggest that 37K CAP may contribute significantly to the ability of PMN to kill gram-negative bacteria by nonoxidative means, particularly as the maturing phagolysosome becomes acidified.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Do clinical microbiology laboratories report complete bacteriology in urine from  patients with long-term urinary catheters?
AB  - Bacteriuria associated with long-term urinary catheters (those in place for greater than or equal to 30 days) appears to be the most common nosocomial infection in U.S. medical care facilities. This bacteriuria is polymicrobial and dynamic and accompanied by fevers, catheter obstructions, bacteremias, and deaths. We compared the reporting by our research laboratory of bacteria present in urine from long-term-catheterized nursing home patients with that by two commercial laboratories. The commercial laboratories isolated significantly fewer bacterial species at 10(5) CFU/ml of urine specimen. Organisms well recognized as causes of urinary tract infections in noncatheterized patients (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) were isolated in comparable frequencies by both the research and commercial laboratories. However, other organisms, including uncommon uropathogens like Providencia stuartii and Morganella morganii, which were actually among the most frequent bacteriuric species in these long-term-catheterized patients, were isolated significantly less frequently by the commercial laboratories. Reasons for the discrepancies are unclear but may involve use of different techniques. More complete reporting may lead to better understanding of the polymicrobial bacteriuria of long-term catheters and its associated complications. This, in turn, may result in improved patient care and infection control in nursing homes.
TI  - Sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14C-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  - Bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. In order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14C-taurocholate (TC) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. The results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. Supernatants from Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14C-TC uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. Streptococcus faecalis (Enterococcus), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from Proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). Bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- SEM) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14C-TC uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). The results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Aztreonam in the treatment of severe urinary tract infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Aztreonam was administered to 30 patients, ages 0.03 to 15.4 years, with severe and in 21 cases complicated urinary tract infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which were resistant to ampicillin and susceptible to the study drug in vitro. A mean dose of 47.7 mg/kg was given intramuscularly every 12 h to 26 patients. In four patients with renal insufficiency, the dose was reduced according to pharmacokinetic data. Permanent urine sterilization and clinical cure were achieved in 22 patients, 13 of whom had urological malformations. In two patients with P. aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis infections, the treatment failed. Another patient had an Escherichia coli reinfection 21 days after the end of therapy. Four patients with various urological abnormalities had gram-positive superinfections, and two patients had gram-negative superinfections during and at the end of therapy: all six had indwelling ureteric splints or pyelostomy as predisposing conditions. No adverse clinical effects were observed. Some transient and slight or moderate alterations were observed at the end of treatment: eosinophilia (nine cases), elevation of hepatic enzymes (eight cases), prolongation of prothrombin time (three cases), and neutropenia (one case). A pharmacokinetic study was performed in six patients with normal renal function and in seven patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency. The elimination half-life of the drug was inversely correlated with the glomerular filtration rate. At the dosage used, aztreonam proved effective for severe urinary tract infections caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae in pediatric patients.
TI  - Comparison of bacteria in the tympanic cavity and the mastoid antrum in chronic otitis media.
AB  - Materials collected from the tympanic cavity before operation and from the mastoid antrum during operation of 58 discharging ears of patients with chronic otitis media were cultured, and the bacteria in these two cavities were compared. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism in the tympanic cavity, and S epidermidis in the mastoid antrum. Anaerobic bacteria were found only in the mastoid antrum of patient with cholesteatoma. In 32 (55 per cent) of the 58 ears examined, bacteria were detected in both the tympanic and mastoid cavities. In 17 ears (53 per cent), the bacterial strains in the two cavities differed. The results indicate the necessity of bacteriologic examination of the mastoid cavity during operation to select antibiotics for postoperative treatment.
TI  - Susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative bacilli to aminoglycosides. Effects of 45 months of amikacin as first-line aminoglycoside therapy.
AB  - Amikacin was instituted as the primary empiric aminoglycoside at the San Juan Veterans Administration Medical Center in January 1982; at that time, 16 percent of the strains at the hospital were gentamicin-resistant. A prospective surveillance study was designed to correlate detection of bacterial resistance with aminoglycoside use. In the current report, the baseline period, during which gentamicin was the first-line aminoglycoside, accounting for 61 percent of overall aminoglycoside use, is compared with the period from January 1982 to September 1985, during which the first-line aminoglycoside was amikacin, accounting for 85 percent of overall use. This study is ongoing. During the two periods, the patient population did not differ with regard to aminoglycoside therapy, indications, or overall aminoglycoside use (541 versus 680 patient days per month). Among the gram-negative bacilli isolated, the percent of strains resistant to amikacin was as follows: pre-baseline period/baseline period, 0.8/0.2 percent; amikacin-usage period, 3.6 percent. Resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin during the period of amikacin use decreased from 16 to 11 percent for gentamicin and from 17 to 11 percent for tobramycin. The decrease in resistance of the gram-negative bacilli to gentamicin varied among strains: the resistance of Escherichia coli decreased from 8 to 4 percent; that of Proteus mirabilis, from 12 to 5 percent; that of indole-positive Proteus, from 19 to 12 percent; that of Acinetobacter, from 57 to 23 percent; that of Citrobacter, from 15 to 7 percent; and that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from 24 to 16 percent. During the amikacin-usage period, amikacin resistance was unchanged for most strains, with the exception of P. aeruginosa, the resistance of which increased from 4.5 to 7.8 percent. Of the 4,795 strains isolated, 174 were resistant to amikacin; of these, 29 Pseudomonas strains were studied for all mechanisms of resistance. Changes in permeability were exhibited by 11 of the 29 strains; 14 strains exhibited the AAC(6')-I enzyme, 10 strains exhibited the APH(3')-II enzyme, and two strains exhibited ANT(2") in addition to some other unidentified mechanism. Multiple enzyme production was found in 15 of the strains. The use of amikacin as a first-line aminoglycoside is associated with a decrease in resistance to other aminoglycosides and a slight increase in overall resistance to amikacin among aerobic gram-negative bacilli. The usefulness of amikacin has not been affected at our institution.
TI  - [In vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. For enterobacteriaceae MICs ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.25); mode MICs varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for Proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for Citrobacter; MICs ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most Enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for Serratia. The rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were Citrobacter or Enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter, with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128. Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. Whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.12). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for Bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). Our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to bladder uroepithelial cells in catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
AB  - To assess the role of bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the pathogenesis of nosocomial urinary tract infection, we prospectively studied 55 patients with indwelling urinary catheters. We obtained uroepithelial cells from the bladder and urine for culture on the patients' entry into the study and every two to four days during catheterization. In all, 235 collections of uroepithelial cells from these patients were used in an in vitro adherence assay with six gram-negative bacterial strains. With uroepithelial cells from patients who did not have bacterial infections, the adherence of the bacteria used in the assay differed significantly according to species. The least adherence occurred with Escherichia coli GR12; the adherence increased with (in order) Proteus mirabilis, E. coli J96, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With cells collected just before the onset of bacteriuria, adherence of these gram-negative strains was higher in patients in whom gram-negative rod infections developed than in those with gram-positive coccal infections (P = 0.005). Analysis with the Cox proportional-hazards model demonstrated that a significant increase in bacterial adherence to uroepithelial cells in the bladder occurred two to four days before the onset of bacteriuria, but that adherence returned to base-line values with the onset of bacteriuria. These results suggest that a transient increase in the adherence of gram-negative bacteria to bladder epithelial cells may be an important early event in the development of catheter-associated bacteriuria.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin with and without clavulanic acid was investigated against 285 freshly isolated clinical strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the agar-dilution technique on Mueller-Hinton-agar. Clavulanic acid had an excellent or moderate potentiating effect on the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin against staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter spp., Acinetobacter, Haemophilus influenzae and Bacteroides spp. No effect was seen against enterococci, indole-positive Proteus spp., Ent. cloacae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The effect of clavulanic acid was dose- and inoculum-dependent.
TI  - Cephalosporins in cutaneous infections. A prospective comparison of two dosage regimens of ceftazidime for therapy of skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of ceftazidime administered as 0.5 g every 8 hours (q8h)  or 1.0 g q8h for at least 5 days were compared in 197 patients and found to be effective in the treatment of cellulitis, abscesses, skin ulcers, and wound infections. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant pathogen in both treatment groups with approximately half of the isolates from each treatment group being gram-positive. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common gram-negative isolate. P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli each comprised 5-12% of the isolates from each treatment group. Clinical cure or improvement was achieved in 98.7% of the patients in each treatment group. Concurrently with clinically successful treatment, a high rate of bacteriologic eradication without superinfection was achieved with the 0.5-g regimen (84% of all isolates) and the 1.0-g regimen (92%).
TI  - [In-vitro activity of cefonicid on hospital bacteria. Regression line and proposal for critical values].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefonicid, a new second generation cephalosporin, against 315 hospital isolates (4th trimester 1984) was investigated. E. coli and Proteus mirabilis were the most susceptible species. All E. coli strains except one were inhibited at 8 mg/l (modal MIC: 0.5); MICs of all indole + Proteus were 8 mg/l (modal MIC: 0.06). Another group was moderately susceptible: MICs of Klebsiella and Citrobacter ranged from 0.12 to 128 mg/l, but MICs of 50% of these strains were less than or equal to 4 mg/l; MIC was less than or equal to 8 mg/l for 75% of indole + Proteus and Providencia strains; tested Proteus vulgaris were especially resistant (MICs greater than 128 mg/l). Most Enterobacter and Serratia strains showed little susceptibility (modal MIC for both species greater than or equal to 128 mg/l). MICs of all tested Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were greater than 128 mg/l. 20 of the 24 tested Acinetobacter strains had a MIC of greater than or equal to 128 mg/l. For Staphylococcus aureus, 88% of methicillin-sensitive strains were inhibited by concentrations of 2 to 4 mg/l whereas methicillin-resistant strains were resistant to cefonicid (75%: MIC greater than 64 mg/l). Enterococci were resistant to cefonicid. A correlation curve was established (Enterobacteria and Staphylococci). On the basis of cefonicid's pharmacokinetic characteristics, critical concentrations are proposed.
TI  - Characterization of pathogenic bacteria by automated headspace concentration-gas  chromatography.
AB  - Automated headspace concentration-gas chromatography (AHC-GC) was used to profile the volatile metabolites produced by Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial cultures were incubated in trypticase soy broth and examined at 24 h. The profiles were consistent for each genus examined and variation observed among the different strains of each species was chiefly quantitative. The volatiles were identified by concurrent headspace concentration-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and consisted mainly of isobutanol, isopentanol, isopentyl acetate, 1-undecene and methyl ketones. There were sufficient differences in the profiles in the 4-6 min elution period to distinguish P. aeruginosa and S. aureus from each other and from the other two bacteria. P. mirabilis and K. pneumoniae typically showed three intense peaks which corresponded to isobutanol, isopentyl acetate and isopentanol. The determination of volatiles by AHC-GC is sensitive, rapid and offers a possible alternative for automatic detection and characterization of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - The diffusion of pefloxacin into bone and the treatment of osteomyelitis.
AB  - Pefloxacin was evaluated in the treatment of bone infections. A clinical trial was performed in 15 patients with chronic osteitis (5 Staphylococcus aureus, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 Serratia sp., 1 Proteus mirabilis, and a mixed infection with a Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli). Patients were given pefloxacin 400 mg 12-hourly iv for 48 h followed by oral treatment. Bone biopsies from the iliac crest were carried out after at least seven days treatment, 2 h after the last dose. Serum levels were estimated at the same time. In 13 patients the pefloxacin levels were between 2 and 10 mg per g of bone and always greater than, or equal to, the MIC for the infecting organism. In 11 patients treated for six months and followed up for up to 14 months after the completion of treatment, the therapy was successful. In another two patients, the results were excellent with closure of fistulae, but there was only limited follow-up. There were two failures: in one (post-radiation osteitis) the infection persisted and in the other there was intolerance of the antimicrobial. In both cases there was no increase in the MIC of pefloxacin against the organisms. Three patients underwent operations for orthopaedic indications, after at least two months of treatment. Bone cultures from the initial focus remained sterile. Side-effects were mild.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic consequences of amikacin use during a 42-month period.
AB  - In June 1980, 23% of our Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and 53% of our Serratia  species were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin. During a 3 1/2-year period of almost exclusive amikacin usage, we noted a fall in overall resistance of gram-negative organisms to tobramycin and gentamicin from 18.8% and 19.3% to 15.2% and 16.2%, respectively. This fall in resistance was most notable for Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia species. During this period there was no increase in amikacin resistance. Age, hospitalization, prior antibiotic therapy, and Foley catheter use were predisposing factors in acquiring amikacin-resistant organisms. Amikacin-resistant gram-negative bacilli were usually sensitive to newer penicillins or cephalosporins.
TI  - [Frequency of isolation and drug resistance of bacterial strains from urine samples tested in the Bacteriology and Virology Laboratory of the U.S.L. 10/D in Florence].
AB  - Two thousand five hundred and sixty-eight positive monomicrobic urine samples (from general practice and hospital wards) were examined and isolated strains were tested against various antimicrobial drugs. Our findings showed that urinary-tract infections caused by Escherichia coli were the most common in females, whereas those by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter species, other difficult Gram-negative rods and Streptococcus faecalis were in total the most common in males. If we compare the strains isolated from general practice with those from the hospital, no significant differences were observed. E. coli strains were the most susceptible to the tested drugs; cefotaxime, amikacin, cefuroxime and ceftazidime were the most effective drugs against Enterobacter species, Ps. aeruginosa, P. rettgeri and Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis and Str. faecalis strains isolated in the hospital were more chemo-resistant than those isolated in general practice. Ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole were less active against E. coli strains isolated from children's departments in comparison with the others.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 compared with other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 (7-[[2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-[[ [1-(2-sulfaminoethyl)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid) a new parenteral cephalosporin was investigated against 780 types of bacteria. SK&F 88070 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Its activity against these species was similar to cefotaxime and moxalactam and superior to cefoperazone and piperacillin. It was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and less active than cefotaxime or cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus. SK&F 88070 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia, which were resistant to cefotaxime and moxalactam were resistant to SK&F 88070. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by the Proteus vulgaris type 1c enzyme. SK&F 88070 inhibited Richmond-Sykes type 1a beta-lactamases.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A-56619 and A-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A-56619 and A-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection with Salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with A-56619 (50% effective dose [ED50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ED50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). E. coli or Pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with A-56619 or A-56620 than with norfloxacin. After oral treatment, the ED50s of A-56619 and A-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against E. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. Norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against E. coli or P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. A-56619 and A-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. A-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and A-56620 was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against Klebsiella pneumonia in mice. A-56619 and A-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. A-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas A-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. The peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of A-56619 and A-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. The serum hal-lives of A-56619 and A-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.
TI  - Ceftriaxone therapy in otolaryngological and pulmonary infections.
AB  - The efficacy of ceftriaxone, 1 g given intramuscularly once daily, was evaluated  in 38 patients with pneumonia (n = 11), pulmonary empyema (n = 2), bronchitis (n = 4), tonsillitis (n = 9), sinusitis (n = 7), and otitis (n = 5). Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 11), viridans type streptococcus (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 6), group A streptococcus (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1). Sterilization of infected foci was obtained in 89.4% of those treated, with clinical recovery in 86.8%. The ceftriaxone regimen was well tolerated.
TI  - Ferric ammonium citrate decomposition--a taxonomic tool for gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The iron uptake test of Szabo and Vandra has been modified and used for the differentiation of Gram-negative bacteria. Nutrient agar containing 20 g per litre of ferric ammonium citrate was distributed into narrow tubes and solidified so as to form butts and slants. Considering the localization of the rusty-brown coloration produced after seeding and incubation, 2367 strains were classified into four groups. (1) Unchanged medium: Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Hafnia alvei and Morganella morganii 100% each, Klebsiella spp., 50%, Enterobacter cloacae 37%, Proteus vulgaris 59%, Acinetobacter spp. 42%, Pseudomonas fluorescens 19%, some other bacteria 2-12%. (2) Rusty-brown slant, unchanged butt: Salmonella subgenera II, III and IV 98%, Citrobacter freundii 65%, E. cloacae 55%, P. vulgaris 41%, Proteus mirabilis 98%, Providencia rettgeri 100%, urease-negative Providencia 96%, Acinetobacter spp. 58%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 100%, P. fluorescens 81%, UFP (unclassified fluorescent pseudomonads) 100%, other Pseudomonas spp. 55%. (3) Unchanged slant, brown butt: S. typhi 88%, Salmonella subgenus I 3%, Klebsiella spp. 31%, some other bacteria 2-3%. (4) Rusty-brown slant, brown butt: Salmonella subgenus I 75%, C. freundii 20%, Klebsiella spp. 12%, some other bacteria 1-5%. Colour reactions in ferric ammonium citrate agar are associated with the accumulation of ferric hydroxide: bacteria giving positive reactions on the slant took up as an average, 63 times more iron than those with negative test. The localization of colour reaction correlated partly with aerobic and anaerobic citrate utilization or decomposition in Simmons' minimal and in Kauffmann's peptone water medium.
TI  - [Bactericidal activity of beta-lactams and aminoglucosides: comparative evaluations].
AB  - In this study we have evaluated the bactericidal activity kinetics of some cephalosporins, ureidopenicillins and aminoglycosides against 41 gram negative clinical isolates. Aminoglycosides, particularly gentamicin, showed the better bactericidal activity which appeared already at the second-third hour after the addition of the antibiotic. The bactericidal activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefotetan was remarkable but it appeared only at the sixth-eight hour. This difference was statistically significant. Carbenicillin and piperacillin showed a low bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We noted a wide variability of the antibiotic bactericidal activity against the isolates of the same bacterial species. Therefore we can argue that in serious infections the determination of the antibiotic and serum bactericidal activity is necessary.
TI  - Comparison of effectiveness of aminoglycosides and cephalosporins in gram-negative rods.
AB  - Aminoglycosides and cephalosporins belong among antimicrobials with a pronounced  effect on most gram-negative rods. In vitro susceptibility and resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, cefoperazone in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested by the quantitative dilution micromethod. Selected, highly susceptible strains of the above species were furthermore compared for minimal inhibitory concentration (MBC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values. Aminoglycosides tended to be the most effective drugs for susceptible strains. In view of their relative toxicity possibly optimal combinations of individual aminoglycosides with individual cephalosporins are discussed.
TI  - Providencia stuartii: a common cause of antibiotic-resistant bacteriuria in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.
AB  - The long-term-catheterized urinary tract may offer a particular niche to Providencia stuartii, which is otherwise an uncommon clinical isolate. Published accounts of bacteriuria in patients catheterized for long periods indicate that P. stuartii has often been found as frequently as familiar uropathogens such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As in most nosocomial infections, the frequency of isolation of a given species has commonly differed among institutions. In the future P. stuartii may be more frequently encountered as a nosocomial pathogen in nursing homes and in acute care hospitals to which bacteriuric patients are transferred. This trend appears likely because of the increasingly large nursing-home population, the predilection of the bacterium for the long-term-catheterized urinary tract, the opportunity for nosocomial transmission from this reservoir, the resistance of the organism to multiple antibiotics, and the occasional systemic illness and bacteremia caused by P. stuartii.
TI  - [Clinical experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in general surgery].
AB  - In a prospective study 43 patients (19 men, 24 women) suffering from severe bacterial infections such as peritonitis (n = 16), soft tissue infection (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 7), septicemia (n = 6), catheter sepsis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 4), osteomyelitis (n = 3), complicated urinary tract infection (n = 2) or endocarditis (n = 1) were treated t. i. d. with short-time i. v. infusions of 0.5 g imipenem/cilastatin for five to 37 days (means = 9). All the patients were cured or significantly improved following therapy with imipenem/cilastatin alone or in combination with surgical intervention. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. 58 (83%) of the 70 pathogens isolated initially were eliminated. The 12 microorganisms (gram-negative aerobic bacteria) which persisted were non-contributory to the course of the infection and had MICs between 0.32 and 4 mg/l. The MICs for 60 isolates were less than or equal to 1 mg/l; the MICs for nine isolates were in the range of 2 to 8 mg/l. One S. epidermidis isolate presented primary resistance to imipenem (MIC 16 mg/l). The tolerability was good. Phlebitis was observed in one case only. Based on our experience we conclude that monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage of 0.5 g t. i. d. is appropriate for the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to the synergistic bactericidal action of serum and polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Polymyxin B nonapeptide was able to sensitize Escherichia coli strains and strains of Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae to the bactericidal action of fresh normal human serum. The degree of sensitization varied significantly within the strains. Strains of Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis remained resistant.
TI  - Ofloxacin: in-vitro activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was evaluated in  273 bacterial strains isolated from urine. The results showed a remarkable activity against most Gram-negative bacteria and, in particular, against Enterobacter aerogenes, which is very difficult to eradicate even with third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Resistance to beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin antibiotics in strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 224 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated  from blood cultures were screened for resistance to cefuroxime and cefotaxime. Seven of 200 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to either cefuroxime or cefotaxime, while five of 24 strains of Ps. aeruginosa were resistant to cefotaxime. A further 32 resistant variants were isolated by use of a single step selection procedure, without prior mutagenesis, from strains which were sensitive on initial screening. From the total of 44 resistant strains and variants isolated, 31 were found to produce elevated levels of chromosomal beta-lactamases. Of these 31, five strains of Proteus sp. produced significant amounts of beta-lactamase only when induced in the presence of cefuroxime or cefotaxime, while the remaining 26 strains also produced high levels of beta-lactamase in the absence of an inducer. Thirteen resistant strains and variants (9 Ps. aeruginosa, 3 P. mirabilis, 1 K. aerogenes) did not produce detectable levels of beta-lactamase in either the presence or absence of induction and presumably owed their resistance to another mechanism.
TI  - Bacteriological study of renal calculi.
AB  - The pre-operative urine, pelvic urine, removed calculi and calculus washings were examined bacteriologically in 24 patients undergoing removal of intrarenal calculi. Four of seven patients with struvite calculi had an infected pre-operative midstream urine specimen and six of the seven removed calculi demonstrated significant bacterial growth. Proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated. Of 17 patients with oxalate calculi only one had an infected pre-operative urine culture, but in four cases the removed stones were infected. Quantitative bacteriological culture of the stones and their washings demonstrated that infection is within the stone itself. Pre-operative urine culture failed to predict infection within the stone in 60% of patients with infected stones. The results suggest that the presence of infected urine together with the presence of renal calculus is indication for removal of the calculus.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  - The activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. Ninety percent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Salmonella, and Shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. Concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit Serratia marcescens and Providencia species, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae had MICs greater than 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae. Cefbuperazone did not inhibit Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas species. Hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis with MIC90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the P99 E. cloacae beta-lactamase with an I50 of 1 microgram/ml. It was a less effective inhibitor of the K. oxytoca K1 and E. coli TEM-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. Cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa and resistant E. cloacae. A permeability barrier in E. cloacae, C. freundii and P. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of cefbuperazone's activity by EDTA.
TI  - [Consumption of aminoglycosides and incidence of resistant gram-negative bacteria in the regional hospital of Perugia].
AB  
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of amifloxacin (WIN 49, 375), a new quinolone agent.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amifloxacin, a quinolone antimicrobial agent was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Ninety percent of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Aeromonas, Salmonella, Shigella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter species, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Morganella morganii were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml. Amifloxacin inhibited Branhamella, Haemophilus, and Neisseria at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, and 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including gentamicin- and carbenicillin-resistant isolates, at 4 micrograms/ml. It also inhibited staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant isolates, but was less active against streptococci and Bacteroides species. Amifloxacin had in vitro activity similar to enoxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin, but was less active than ciprofloxacin. Like other quinolones, it was less active at acid pH and in the presence of urine.
TI  - [Changes in the migration and adhesive activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes as 1 of the characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients with suppurative lung destruction].
AB  - The influence of Gram-negative bacteria on the migratory and adhesive activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) in the peripheral blood of clinically normal donors has been studied by the specially developed method with the use of Boyden chambers. Pseudomonas and enterobacteria have been found to produce complex and various effects on the above-mentioned properties of PMNL. When incubated in fresh serum, Gram-negative bacteria are capable of enhancing the migratory activity of PMNL, this property being least pronounced in P. aeruginosa. The incubation of live bacteria from the authors' collection in the patients' sera or in sera obtained from normal donors and inactivated by heating induces no hemotaxis of PMNL, and P. aeruginosa strains even suppress it under such conditions. The isolated Gram-negative bacteria under study increase the number of highly adhesive PMNL in the population used in this investigation, but P. aeruginosa cultures do not produce such effect.
TI  - Further characterization of bacterial adherence to urinary bladder mucosa: comparison with adherence to anion exchange resin.
AB  - Bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin has recently been reported to provide a useful, rapid, in vitro screening assay for identifying putative antiadherence agents. The studies presented in this report provide additional evidence that adherence to anion exchange resin is similar to urinary bladder mucosa adherence. Results are as follows. 1) Heparin inhibits the adherence of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus fecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to both the mucin deficient bladder and anion exchange resin. 2) Drugs which inhibit E. coli adherence to the bladder also inhibit E. coli adherence to the resin and conversely, drugs which do not effect E. coli adherence to the resin do not affect attachment to the bladder. 3) Extracts from mammalian urinary bladder mucosa prevent E. coli adherence to both the bladder and resin. 4) The ability of heparin to displace preattached bacteria from anion exchange resin is inversely proportional to the time the bacteria are in contact with resin. Similar results were obtained for the ability of heparin to displace bacteria from the bladder. These studies indicate that bacterial adherence to anion exchange resin responds to heparin and other chemical agents in a manner similar to the mucin deficient rabbit urinary bladder. Because of the ease and rapid nature of this in vitro assay, it serves as a useful screen for potential bacterial antiadherence agents and could be used to help elucidate mechanisms of bacterial attachment.
TI  - Comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A comparison of aztreonam and tobramycin was carried out in 49 hospitalized patients with lower respiratory tract infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment drug. Clindamycin was given concomitantly until the pathogen was identified and the presence of a gram-positive microorganism was ruled out. Samples of sputum were obtained for culture from the lung parenchyma by deep expectoration or transtracheal aspiration. A pathogen was defined as an organism that showed heavy growth and predominated in the culture. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis. A variety of less common pathogens were represented. Thirty-five patients were treated with intravenous aztreonam (1-2 g every 8 hr) and 14 with intravenous tobramycin (3-5 mg/kg per day) until they were afebrile and sputum cultures had been free of the pathogen for 48 hr. The minimum duration of treatment was five days. In the aztreonam group, only two (5%) of the 37 gram-negative pathogens--one P. aeruginosa and one Escherichia coli--persisted. In the tobramycin group, seven (50%) of the 14 pathogens persisted. Clinical response paralleled microbiologic response. Adverse effects in both treatment groups were minor and transient. In this trial aztreonam was effective and safe for treatment of lower respiratory tract infections caused by P. aeruginosa and a variety of other gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. Although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher MIC values, and most Bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. The overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. Ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. The activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid pH and in urine, but serum had no effect on MICs or MBCs. Increase in ofloxacin MICs for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
TI  - Aztreonam in the treatment of bone and joint infections caused by gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Aztreonam was used successfully in 17 of 17 patients with orthopedic infections due to gram-negative bacilli (11, osteomyelitis; six, septic arthritis). Duration of treatment ranged from 14 to 55 days, and the period of follow-up was four to 18 months. Causative organisms included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter gergoviae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Aztreonam was well tolerated. The only definite reactions attributable to aztreonam were asymptomatic increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) and serum alanine aminotransferase (SGPT) in four patients; none of these reactions interfered with completion of therapy. Adverse reactions that were possibly attributable to aztreonam included rash (two patients), diarrhea (one patient), and leukopenia (one patient). All of these patients were receiving antibiotics active against gram-positive organisms in mixed infections in addition to aztreonam. Aztreonam is a promising new monobactam without significant toxicity. It has good activity against gram-negative aerobic bacteria, including P. aeruginosa, and is effective in the treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative aerobes.
TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of amikacin in dogs.
AB  - After IV, IM, and subcutaneous injection of single dosages of amikacin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg of body weight) in each of 4 dogs, the elimination kinetics of amikacin were determined. The pattern of urinary excretion and cumulative amount excreted unchanged in 24 hours were also determined. Amikacin had a short half-life (approx 1 hour) that was independent of the dosage. Intravenous injection of 10 mg/kg gave apparent volume of distribution of 226 +/- 37 ml/kg and body clearance of 2.64 +/- 0.24 ml/min.kg (mean +/- SD, n = 4). Within 6 hours, greater than 90% of the antibiotic was excreted in the urine, regardless of the route of administration. For isolates of common bacterial species from the canine urinary tract, minimum inhibitory concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin were determined in vitro. Cumulative percentages were approximately the same for urinary isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coagulase-positive staphylococci that were susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) to increasing concentrations of amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, in vitro. Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly more susceptible to amikacin than were the other bacteria evaluated. Widest variations in susceptibility to aminoglycosides were found with urinary isolates of streptococcal species. For dogs with normal renal function, an amikacin dosage of 10 mg/kg (IM or subcutaneously) is recommended every 8 hours for treatment of systemic infections, and every 12 hours for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by susceptible bacteria.
TI  - [Comparative studies of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1983). III. Secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of antibiotics against causative pathogens  isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) in the 8 institutions in Japan during the period from 1980 to 1983 were compared. A number of new beta-lactam antibiotics with broad spectrum of activity have become available for clinical use in recent years. Some of them, in particular so-called third generation cephems, are reported to be responsible for developing microbial-cross resistance to multiple beta-lactam antibiotics. We have been making survey in recent years to explore changes in susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents of clinical isolates. All bacterial isolates from clinical specimens were submitted to the Department of Clinical Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, where they were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility with MIC 2000 apparatus. Of all pathogens from patients with simple UTI, the majority of the isolates was E. coli and Klebsiella spp. In cases of complicated UTI, on the other hand, Pseudomonas spp. were most frequent, followed in order by Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp. and E. coli. Conspicuous changes in antimicrobial activity of antibiotics against E. coli and Klebsiella spp. from simple UTI have not been found in our survey. Against strains of Citrobacter spp., even the third generation cephems proved to be not remarkably active and there was a significant decrease in susceptibility of isolates to the drugs test-showed MIC values of 50 micrograms/ml and the proportion increased to 50% (22/44) with isolates obtained in 1982. The antimicrobial activity of cefsulodin and gentamicin against P. aeruginosa was decreased in 1982 compared with that in 1980 and 1981. However, resistant strains were slightly more frequent with gentamicin. In 1983, the antimicrobial activity of third generation cephems against Serratia spp. was significantly reduced from that in 1982.
TI  - [Comparative evaluation of skin tests in surgical patients].
AB  - A comparative estimation of the prognostic value of skin tests was made with tuberculin, coli-bacillus antigens, Candida, blue pus bacillus and more complete set of microbic allergens (hemolytic staphylococcus, white streptococcus, blue pus bacillus, coli-bacillus, group pneumococcus, Candida, Proteus Mirabilis). High prognostic information value was noted by results of skin tests in patients examined with the help of a set consisting of 7 antigens.
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of intraabdominal infections: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  - Imipenem is a new broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic, which when administered  with cilastatin may be a suitable alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside and either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole as therapy for intraabdominal infections. The clinical and microbiologic results for 164 assessable patients given imipenem/cilastatin for intraabdominal infections are reported. Only three of 416 bacterial strains isolated prior to therapy from intraabdominal infection sites were resistant to imipenem (one of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one of Morganella morganii, and one of the Fusobacterium varium). Resistance acquired during treatment was reported in four cases: for three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for one strain of Proteus mirabilis. Of 412 strains susceptible to imipenem prior to therapy, 359 were eradicated during treatment. The frequency of clinical cure or improvement was 91%. Imipenem/cilastatin seems to be a useful alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside with either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole.
TI  - Review of the in vitro spectrum of activity of imipenem.
AB  - Imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin, MK0787), a new carbapenem was found to have  the widest antimicrobial activity of currently available beta-lactam drugs. Enterobacteriaceae had minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem of 8.0 micrograms/ml or less for 99.8 percent of clinical isolates. Only rare strains of Enterobacter species and Proteus mirabilis have higher imipenem minimal inhibitory concentration results. Hemophilus and Neisseria species were inhibited, but minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were higher than those reported for third-generation cephalosporins. Only Pseudomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas cepacia strains were imipenem resistant (MIC50 greater than 32 micrograms/ml) among the commonly isolated non-enteric gram-negative bacilli. All anaerobes were found susceptible to imipenem with the exception of some strains of Clostridium difficile. Staphylococcus species and non-enterococcal streptococci were very susceptible to imipenem. Streptococcus faecalis had higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem (MIC90 3.1 micrograms/ml) and S. faecium strains were frankly resistant. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had a MIC90 of 27.2 micrograms imipenem/ml. Imipenem was generally bactericidal except for marked minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentration differences with enterococci, Listeria, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and some P. aeruginosa strains. The minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of imipenem were not significantly influenced by organism inoculum size, probably because of its beta-lactamase stability to nearly all commonly encountered bacterial enzymes. Imipenem was found to be an excellent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and a potent enzyme inducer. The induction characteristic seems responsible for the antagonistic interactions of imipenem with some enzyme-labile beta-lactams in combination. Imipenem had limited stability in some in vitro susceptibility test systems. The 10 micrograms disk test or dry-form broth micro-dilution systems were preferred, applying the interpretive criteria from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (M2-A3). Imipenem-resistant strains were rarely found in clinical practice and bacteria resistant to newer beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were generally very susceptible to this new carbapenem.
TI  - Role of imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of soft tissue infections.
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin was given to 243 evaluable patients with moderately severe to severe soft tissue infections. Cultures prior to therapy yielded Staphylococcus aureus (108 isolates), group D and non-group D enterococci (49), group A streptococci (42), other aerobic gram-positive cocci (72), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54), Escherichia coli (32), Proteus mirabilis (31), Enterobacter (21), Klebsiella (20), other aerobic gram-negative rods (58), Bacteroides fragilis group (16), and other anaerobes (65). Overall, 95 percent (230 of 243) of the patients treated had clinical cure (137 of 243) or improvement (93 of 243). Of the 506 strains of etiologic bacterial pathogens isolated from these patients and tested against imipenem, 498 (98 percent) were susceptible to the antibiotic. Many were resistant to both older and newer penicillins and cephalosporins. Serial cultures of infection sites revealed that 426 of 498 (86 percent) of pre-therapy bacterial isolates were eradicated by imipenem/cilastatin therapy. Eight of 498 etiologic pathogens (1.6 percent) acquired resistance to imipenem (seven P. aeruginosa and one enterococcus). Such resistance acquisition was associated with clinical failure in two patients. Imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a highly effective, relatively safe therapy of soft tissue infections caused by a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, both polymicrobial and monomicrobial in nature. Imipenem/cilastatin should be considered particularly when infection by the more antibiotic-resistant of these bacteria is suspected or proved.
TI  - In vitro comparative antimicrobial activity of cefpimizole against clinical isolates from five medical centers.
AB  - Cefpimizole was compared with cefoperazone and cefotaxime against 6,599 clinical  bacterial isolates from five medical centers. Cefoperazone and cefotaxime were both more active and provided a greater spectrum of antimicrobial coverage than cefpimizole. Some of the cefpimizole minimum concentrations inhibiting 50% of tested strains were as follows: Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae, 16 micrograms/ml; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.0 micrograms/ml; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0 microgram/ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus spp., 32 micrograms/ml; and the enterococci, greater than 32 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Screening of microorganisms for nitrosation catalysis at pH 7 and kinetic studies on nitrosamine formation from secondary amines by E. coli strains.
AB  - Thirty-eight strains of microorganisms isolated from infected human trachea, urine, blood and faeces were examined for their ability to form N-nitrosomorpholine from morpholine and nitrite at pH 7.25. Twenty-five bacterial strains exhibited nitrosation activity, including 18 out of 19 strains of Escherichia coli and three out of nine Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Neisseria strains; E. coli A10 strain showed the highest activity. Formation of N-nitrosomorpholine was proportional to the incubation time up to 2 h and to the number of resting E. coli A10 cells; the reaction followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Nitrosation rate appeared to be dependent on the pKa value of several amines studied. As the nitrosation catalysis was heat-labile, our data suggest that N-nitrosation is catalysed by a bacterial enzyme(s). This reaction may lead to enhanced endogenous nitrosation in subjects suffering from an achlorhydric stomach or from chronic urinary tract infections.
TI  - [In vitro effect of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Line of regression and critical values].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone, a new third generation cephalosporin, against hospital isolates was investigated. 312 strains belonging to the most commonly recovered species were studied using the following methods: agar diffusion (disk antibiotic testing), agar dilution (determination of MIC) and dilution in a liquid medium with subculture to agar plates (determination of MBC). Except for a few Citrobacter strains and rare Serratia strains, all Enterobacteriaceae tested proved highly susceptible, with MICs less than or equal to 1 mg/l and mode MICs ranging from 0.003 mg/l (Proteus) to 0.25 mg/l (Enterobacter). MICs ranged from 16 to 32 mg/l for Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 mg/l) and 16 to greater than or equal to 128 for Pseudomonas (mode MIC greater than or equal to 128 mg/l). Methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were moderately susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC: 2 to 8 mg/l) whereas methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 64 mg/l). Bactericidal activity was excellent: MBC/MIC less than or equal to 2 (except for a few Serratia strains). A correlation curve was established. Given the high serum concentrations of ceftriaxone (achieved with the usual maximal dosage) and its unusually extended half-life (7 to 8 h), the following cutoff concentrations can be proposed: C less than or equal to 4 mg/l, corresponding to greater than or equal to 20 mm: susceptible bacteria C greater than 32 mg/l, corresponding to less than 15 mm: resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. Antimicrobial activities. MICs of CMNX against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml or less were 4% for S. aureus, 0% for E. faecalis, 100% for E. coli, 81% for K. pneumoniae, 3% for Enterobacter sp., 18% for S. marcescens, 90% for P. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive Proteus sp. 100% for S. flexneri, 100% for Salmonella sp., 0% for Citrobacter sp. and 0% for P. aeruginosa. Most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. These activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. Clinical efficacy Three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with CMNX daily dose of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. Clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). Bacteriological effects were good for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. liquefaciens, poor for P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. C. freundii, A. calcoaceticus and E. faecalis were cultured after treatment. No side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.
TI  - [Activity of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (augmentin) combination on strains of hospital isolates].
AB  - All strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacilli (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter) isolated from 01.01 to 03.31.83 were studied using agar diffusion with augmentin-impregnated discs (amoxicillin 20 micrograms + clavulanic acid 10 micrograms). Augmentin is active against penicillinase-producing Staphylococci susceptible to methicillin, whereas methicillin-resistant strains are also resistant to augmentin. According to the susceptibility of strains to amoxicillin, carbenicillin and cefalotin, Enterobacteriaceae can be divided into five main phenotypes, of which four are resistant. "RSR" and "RRR" phenotypes, which are cephalosporinase producers, are chiefly found among Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter and indole + Proteus; in these groups a change in inhibition diameters indicating activity of augmentin is observed only in a significant number of Proteus vulgaris strains. "RRS" and "RRI" strains are penicillinase producers found mainly among E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis; they emerge as very susceptible to augmentin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is never susceptible to augmentin. Augmentin is slightly more active than amoxicillin on some Acinetobacter strains but the difference is too inconsiderable to be of clinical significance.
TI  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome (HR 810), a pyridine cephalosporin agent active against staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new cyclopyridinium cephalosporin, was evaluated against 947 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefpirome inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter diversus, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Haemophilus and Neisseria species at less than or equal to 0.4 mg/l. It had activity comparable to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and moxalactam against these species. Only a few Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens had MICs above 3.1 mg/l. The activity of cefpirome against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 90% MIC of 12.5 mg/l, was superior to piperacillin, moxalactam, cefotaxime and cefoperazone. The 90% MIC against Staphylococcus aureus was 0.8 mg/l, but methicillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited. Cefpirome was not significantly hydrolyzed by most plasmid beta-lactamases (TEM, SHV-1, PSE, OXA) nor by chromosomal enzymes (P99, Branhamella catarrhalis, K1). Cefpirome did not inhibit chromosomal or plasmid beta-lactamases. Mice systemically infected with E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were protected by concentrations of cefpirome ranging from 0.85 mg/kg for K. pneumoniae to 4.467 mg/kg for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Interaction of subminimal inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and gram-negative aerobic organisms: effects on adhesion and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function.
AB  - The effect of pre-incubation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis with sub-inhibitory concentrations (sub MICs) of clindamycin on the adherence of these organisms was studied. Culturing these organisms in the presence of clindamycin (4 mg/l) resulted in significant enhancement of adherence for Ps. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis and decreased adherence for K. pneumoniae. Furthermore, the effect of pre-exposure to clindamycin on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNLs) function against these organisms was determined. Filtrates of Pr. mirabilis pre-exposed to clindamycin promoted PMNL chemotaxis. No effect on chemotaxis was noted with the filtrates of clindamycin treated Ps. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. PMNL phagocytosis for all the organisms was increased after they were pre-exposed to clindamycin.
TI  - Aztreonam in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host  defenses.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  aztreonam in hospital-acquired infections. Twenty patients (13 men and 7 women) with impaired host defenses and nosocomial infections were treated with aztreonam at a dosage ranging 4 and 6 g/day I.V. at 8 or 12-hour intervals. Average length of therapy was 10.35 +/- 4.61 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Enterobacter cloacae (1), Proteus mirabilis (2), Proteus vulgaris (1), Acinetobacter anitratus (1), Serratia marcescens (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (1). In 5 patients (25%) a mixed infection was observed. Sixteen patients (80%) were completely cured from infection and 24 isolated organisms (88.8%) were eradicated. No adverse reactions were observed. Aztreonam has undoubtedly high clinical and bacteriological efficacy in the therapy of nosocomial infections in patients with impaired host defenses.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Binding of polymyxin B nonapeptide to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The binding of the outer membrane-disorganizing peptide polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) to gram-negative bacteria was studied by using tritium-labeled PMBN. Smooth Salmonella typhimurium had a binding capacity of ca. 6 nmol of PMBN per mg (dry weight) of bacteria, which corresponds to ca. 1 X 10(6) to 2 X 10(6) molecules of PMBN per single cell. The binding was of relatively high affinity (Kd, 1.3 microM). The isolated outer membrane of S. typhimurium bound ca. 100 nmol of PMBN per mg of outer membrane protein (Kd, 1.1 microM), whereas the cytoplasmic membrane bound 9 to 10 times less. Other bacteria which are susceptible to the action of PMBN (Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae) also bound large amounts of PMBN. The S. typhimurium pmrA mutant, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Proteus mirabilis (all known as resistant to polymyxin and PMBN) bound 3.3, 4, and 12 times less than S. typhimurium, respectively. The binding of PMBN to S. typhimurium was effectively inhibited by low concentrations of polymyxin B, compound EM49 (octapeptin), polylysine, and protamine. Spermine, Ca2+, and Mg2+ also inhibited the PMBN binding although they were ca. 160, 700, and 2,400 times less active (based on molarity) than polymyxin B, respectively. No binding inhibition was found at the tested concentrations of streptomycin, tetralysine, spermidine, or cadaverine.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Aztreonam therapy for gram-negative pneumonia.
AB  - Nineteen patients with community- or hospital-acquired gram-negative pneumonia were treated with aztreonam. Other gram-negative antibiotics were withheld. Thirteen patients (68 percent) had clinical cures and 15 (79 percent) had microbiologic cures with aztreonam. No adverse reactions or drug toxicity occurred in this population.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Comparison of the exoproducts of gram-negative bacteria by SDS-Page.
AB  - The protein exoproducts released during exponential growth of Gram-negative bacteria were analysed and compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-Page). The following bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia rubidaea, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella minnesota, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens. It is demonstrated by SDS-Page that members of one species show identical protein pattern, whereas different species show besides comparable protein bands a species characteristic pattern. All members of Enterobacteriaceae were shown to release proteins whose molecular weights fell into the following size regions: Each strain was shown to synthesize a polypeptide of molecular weight 34,000 and one or more polypeptides within the molecular weight range 25,000-29,000. This profile was shown to be clearly different from that of Pseudomonas strains where 20 or more distinct polypeptides ranging from 12,500 to 160,000 Mr were detectable.
TI  - Detection of gram-negative bacteremia by limulus amebocyte lysate assay: evaluation in a rat model of peritonitis.
AB  - A spectrophotometric Limulus amebocyte lysate assay using lysis filtration and centrifugation has been developed for the detection of gram-negative bacteria in blood. The assay is directed at detection of endotoxin in viable and nonviable bacteria present in the blood-stream and not detection of free endotoxin in plasma. The assay was evaluated in a model of peritonitis in which rats were challenged with an inoculum consisting of sterilized human feces, barium sulfate, and one of eight species of bacteria. This assay was able to detect gram-negative bacteremia due to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the rat model when compared with sham-inoculated uninfected rats. The assay failed to detect bacteremia due to Bacteroides fragilis or Staphylococcus aureus, nor was there a significant rise in absorbance when a pellet containing sterilized feces was implanted in the rat.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - Bilateral and symmetrical osteomyelitis due to gram-negative bacilli. A report on two cases.
AB  - Gram-negative bacillary osteomyelitis secondary to sepsis is a rare condition. It most frequently attacks the vertebrae, occasionally in the long bones, and can on occasion be multiple. We present 2 patients with severe sepsis of urinary origin who, after a latent period, developed bilateral and symmetrical osteomyelitis due to the same microorganism that caused the sepsis. We discuss this peculiar presentation, its possible pathogenetic mechanism and the need to consider osteomyelitis in the presence of bilateral and symmetrical arthritis after an episode of severe sepsis.
TI  - [Obtaining antisera to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus antigens for performing immunoenzyme analyses in clinical practice].
AB  - The data presented in this work indicate that specific antisera to P. aeruginosa  and Proteus antigens can be produced by using extracts from these microorganisms, destroyed by ultrasonic treatment or by multiple freezing and thawing, for the immunization of rabbits. Blood serum samples from patients with purulent septic complications were studied for the presence of P. aeruginosa and Proteus antigens in ELISA with the use of peroxidase-labeled antibodies from antisera to P. aeruginosa and Proteus. This investigation revealed that during the first 3 days from the beginning of the clinical manifestations of the complications P. aeruginosa and Proteus antigens were detected in 86.4% and 83.4% of the patients, respectively. In the subsequent bacteriological study of wound discharge from these patients the corresponding microflora was detected.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of current disinfectants for leg bags.
AB  - An in vitro study was performed investigating the bactericidal ability of five common cleaning agents for leg bags against organisms frequently causing urinary tract infection in spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. Individual disposable Uridrain leg bags were inoculated with urine containing greater than 10(5) colonies/ml of the selected organism. The organisms used were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Herellea, and Enterococcus. Each pair of inoculated bags (one bag for immediate or 0 hour culture and one bag for 24 hour culture) was filled with 30 ml of the test solution, cleaned, drained, and then cultured. The tested solutions included: plain tap water, 1/4% acetic acid, 3% hydrogen peroxide, Sporicidin 1:16 dilution, and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite. The results demonstrated that plain tap water had no effect on reducing the bacterial counts and that 1/4% acetic acid and 3% hydrogen peroxide had only a marginal effect across the spectrum of organisms. Sporicidin and 0.06% sodium hypochlorite exhibited complete bactericidal ability. In the final analysis, 0.06% sodium hypochlorite is the most cost efficient and readily accessible to patients. In practical application, disinfecting daily with 0.06% sodium hypochlorite can decrease external contamination of urinary drainage appliances in SCI patients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - New orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp. indole-positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. None of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against Bacteroides fragilis. Ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though the difference was less marked. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against S. aureus. Results with agar and with broth were comparable. The activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the MIC values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). The new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against Staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the Bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against Ps. aeruginosa. Pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - An evaluation of the bacteriolytic and biochemical properties of ceftiolene (42980RP).
AB  - Ceftiolene (42980RP) is a new cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum similar to cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The characteristics of ceftiolene have been tested in a variety of assays involving various biochemical aspects of the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. The affinities of ceftiolene for penicillin-binding proteins were very comparable with those of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime for Escherichia coli, and generally greater than those of latamoxef (moxalactam) for the higher molecular weight PBPs of E. coli. Enterobacter cloacae. Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The affinity of ceftiolene for PBP1 of Staphylococcus aureus was greater than those of cefotaxime or latamoxef, but comparable with these antibiotics for PBP3. The bacteriolytic activity of ceftiolene at defined concentrations against Gram-negative organisms was similar to that of ceftriaxone, and significantly better than that of the other third-generation cephalosporins tested. Introduction of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases into E. coli reduced the wide variation in bacteriolytic effect of the different cephalosporins, and a significant inoculum effect was observed for the bacteriolysis. Chloramphenicol was less antagonistic against ceftiolene- or ceftriaxone-induced lysis than was observed for cefotaxime or latamoxef. Growth of Staph. aureus at low concentrations of ceftiolene caused the bacteria to become more sensitive to lysis by lysostaphin than organisms grown with cefotaxime or latamoxef under the same conditions. These observations confirm the necessity to use techniques other than routine MIC determinations to distinguish between antibiotics which would otherwise appear very similar.
TI  - In vitro effect of pH and glucose concentration on the antibacterial activity of  norfloxacin in urine.
AB  - The in vitro effect of pH and glucose concentration on the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin in urine was studied. Norfloxacin effectively inhibited the growth of four gram-negative pathogens in urine in vitro at pH values of 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. The antibacterial activity of norfloxacin in urine was reduced severalfold at pH 6, but minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at this pH remained clinically significant. Glucose at concentrations of 200 mg/dl and 400 mg/dl (simulating glucosuria of diabetes) did not significantly affect the antibacterial activity of norfloxacin when tested against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Norfloxacin appears to be a highly effective antibiotic in vitro under conditions which simulate normal and diabetic states.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of norfloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and gentamicin in experimentally-infected normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.
AB  - Systemic bacterial infections due to Escherichia coli MB 2884, Proteus mirabilis  MB 3125 and Klebsiella pneumoniae MB 4005 were well controlled by treatment with norfloxacin both in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. similar observations were made when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used against susceptible pathogens. Systemic infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa MB 4700 was well controlled by norfloxacin and gentamicin in normal mice; this infection was more refractory to treatment by both drugs in diabetic animals. These observations suggest that norfloxacin may be an effective drug in the treatment of bacterial infections which may occur under diabetic conditions, and further investigation is warranted.
TI  - The use of penicillins in orthopaedic surgery.
AB  - The main use of the penicillins in orthopedic surgery is in the treatment of infections due to Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Group D streptococci (enterococci). Penicillins have antimicrobial activity and have a characteristic pharmacodynamic action, including side effects. The tissue penetration characteristics of the penicillins into synovial fluid and human bone are significant. Semisynthetic penicillins, antistaphylococcal penicillins, and the antipseudomonal penicillins are used for treatment of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. Oral penicillin therapy can be useful in treatment of osteomyelitis.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa acid phosphatase and cholinesterase induced by choline and its metabolic derivatives may contain a similar anionic peripheral site.
AB  - Different compounds derived from choline, and obtained by demethylation or by oxidation of the primary alcohol group with subsequent N-demethylation, were tested as inducer agents of acid phosphatase and cholinesterase in Ps. aeruginosa. It was found that betaine and dimethylglycine were the most effective inducers of both enzyme activities. These metabolites including choline itself, were not inducers of acid phosphatase and cholinesterase in other Gram-negative bacteria such as: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter liquefacciens and Proteus mirabilis. The acid phosphatase activities found in these bacteria were not inhibited in vitro by choline, betaine and phosphorylcholine. From these results it may be concluded that the acid phosphatase activity from Ps. aeruginosa is different from the same activity observed in the other bacteria. In addition, it is also shown that Ps. aeruginosa acid phosphatase and cholinesterase were inhibited by a number of compounds containing a positively charged amino group, with methyl or ethyl groups bound to it. These results seem to confirm that Ps. aeruginosa acid phosphatase and cholinesterase may contain a similar anionic site.
TI  - Nonspecific necrotizing petrositis: an unusual complication of otitis in children.
AB  - Three cases of an unusual form of suppurative chronic otitis media in children 2  and 3 years old are presented. The clinical feature common to all cases was otorrhea, beginning at the first months of life, with a silent evolution to a complete peripheral facial paralysis. In one case the facial paralysis was bilateral. The treatment applied was surgical: subtotal petrosectomy. The surgical findings were bloody granulation tissue, sequestering completely the otic capsule. The facial nerve was destroyed almost the total length of the Fallopian canal in all cases. The histopathologic examination revealed a destructive and nonspecific chronic inflammatory process. The culture showed Gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Etiologic aspects involved in the process are discussed and the name non-specific necrotizing petrositis is suggested to individualize this rare form of otitis which, with morbidity, leads to severe complications such as facial paralysis and deafness.
TI  - Effects of subinhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime on adhesion and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function with gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effect of pre-incubation of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae with subinhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime on adherence and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function against these organisms was studied. Culturing the above organisms in the presence of cefotaxime (1/4 MIC) resulted in reduced adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Furthermore pre-incubation of all organisms with sub MICs of cefotaxime resulted in significant enhancement of polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis and bactericidal activity against these organisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Scanning electron microscopy detects bacteria within infection stones.
AB  - The viability and location of bacteria within infection stones were investigated. Many stones were infected with urea-splitting bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Large numbers of bacterial impressions and bodies were found in the interstices surrounded by crystals of apatite and struvite from the nuclei to the peripheral layers. The presence of bacterial colonies even in the nuclear portion of the stones suggests that bacteria participate in the initial stone formation as well as in growth of infection stones. Streptococcus faecalis, a nonurea -splitting bacteria, also was found in some infection stones and probably represents a superimposed infection as a result of changes in bacterial flora owing to treatment with antibiotics.
TI  - Thymidine kinase of bacteria: activity of the enzyme in actinomycetes and related organisms.
AB  - Various micro-organisms were studied for their thymidine kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) (TK) activity. The sonicated cell extract of Escherichia coli K12 had a TK activity of 35-66 pmol thymidine monophosphate formed min-1 (mg protein)-1. The cell extracts of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a markedly higher (5- to 11-fold) TK activity. Somewhat lower but significant TK activity was detected in the cell extracts of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast, weak TK activity, if any, was detected in the cell extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This was also the case with respect to the cell extracts of various actinomycetes (such as Nocardia and Streptomyces) and related organisms (such as Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus).
TI  - [Sensitivity to fosfomycin of bacteria isolated at the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in 1982 and 1983].
AB  - Susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (FOS) was tested with Mueller-Hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms FOS + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). For 3 411 strains, inhibition zone diameters were recorded. Almost all E. coli, Citrobacter, Salmonella and S. aureus were susceptible to FOS as well as 70% of Serratia, E. cloacae, P. mirabilis and 50% of Klebsiella and Enterobacter sp. Only 27% of P. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive Proteus and 8% of Acinetobacter were sensitive to FOS. E. coli, Citrobacter and S. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to FOS. Sensitivity rates of E. cloacae, Serratia, P. aeruginosa, and especially Klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. This method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible Enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate G6P concentrations at this point of the disk.
TI  - Synergistic effect of bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, anaerobic cocci, and aerobic bacteria on mortality and induction of subcutaneous abscesses in mice.
AB  - The potential for synergy between aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria was studied by subcutaneous inoculation of mixtures of these organisms into mice and observation of subsequent mortality and abscess formation. The anaerobic bacteria tested included 12 strains of gram-positive cocci and two strains each of Bacteroides species, Clostridium species, and Fusobacterium species. The facultative and aerobic bacteria included one strain each of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Mortality increased significantly when each aerobic organism was inoculated along with either of the Bacteroides species. A similar increase occurred when the anaerobic gram-positive cocci were inoculated along with P. aeruginosa (four of six combinations) or S. aureus (four of six). The rate of abscess induction increased significantly when 10 of the 12 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci were injected along with B. fragilis and when nine of these strains were inoculated along with Bacteroides asaccharolyticus . The results demonstrate synergistic potential between Bacteroides species and all aerobic bacteria tested, between Bacteroides species and most anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and between most anaerobic gram-positive cocci and P. aeruginosa or S. aureus.
TI  - Ceftazidime concentrations in human aqueous humor.
AB  - Two grams of ceftazidime was given to 25 patients before cataract surgery. Mean aqueous humor concentrations of 2.8, 3.2, 3.39, and 1.94 micrograms/mL were observed 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours, respectively, after administration of the drug. These concentrations are many times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ceftazidime against 90% ( MIC90 ) of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Proteus mirabilis, and indole-positive Proteus sp. The peak aqueous humor level was also equivalent to or slightly higher than the MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to polymyxin B nonapeptide.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of polymyxin B nonapeptide sensitized all 21 polymyxin-susceptible gram-negative bacterial strains studied to hydrophobic antibiotics such as fusidic acid, novobiocin, and erythromycin. The susceptibility increases were usually 30- to 300-fold. The strains included representatives of Escherichia coli with different O- and K-antigens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Salmonella typhimurium, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas maltophilia. In contrast, polymyxin-resistant strains (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Serratia marcescens) were resistant to the action of polymyxin B nonapeptide.
TI  - Low levels of functional of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor in the promotion of C3-cleavage by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyema.
AB  - It has been suggested that C3 breakdown by granulocyte-neutral proteases in pleural empyemas may be related to a decreased inhibitor potential for these enzymes. In the present study it was shown that in 17 infected pleural effusions, high proteolytic activity on 125I-labeled C3 (16.3% +/- 4.4%) correlated with low functional levels of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI), as determined by trypsin-inhibitory capacity (56.2 +/- 20.1 IU/ml; rs = -0.97, P less than .001), whereas in 18 sterile pleural effusions there was no such correlation (125I-labeled C3 cleavage, 2.2% +/- .2%; trypsin-inhibitory capacity, 192.6 +/- 26.7 IU/ml). However, alpha 1-PI and alpha 2-macroglobulin protein concentrations in infected and sterile effusions (as measured by immunodiffusion) were similar. Fifteen strains of three bacterial species--Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis--isolated from patients with pneumonia or empyema inactivated the elastase-inhibitory capacity of alpha 1-PI in vitro. These results show that in empyemas functional levels of alpha 1-PI were too low to inactivate granulocyte elastase and that some bacterial species may contribute to the low inhibitor potential of infected pleural fluid by direct alpha 1-PI inactivation.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity between L-norvalyl-L-1-aminoethylphosphonic acid and nocardicin A.
AB  - The phosphonopeptide L- norvalyl -L-1- aminoethylphosphonic acid [ Nva -Ala(P)] has been studied in combination with 12 beta-lactam antibiotics for activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Nocardicin A was found to give the most potent synergistic combination with Nva -Ala(P). This interaction was widely observed in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa in vitro and in a mouse septicemia model. Synergy was also observed in vitro and in vivo in several other species, including Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., and Serratia marcescens. The interaction between Nva -Ala(P) and nocardicin A involved a strongly bacteriolytic mechanism. In addition, the individual components were complementary to one another in their action against organisms not showing synergy. These properties resulted in a broad spectrum of activity of the combination Nva -Ala(P) plus nocardicin A when used to treat experimental gram-negative bacterial infections.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - [Bacteriological and architectural studies of infected stones].
AB  - The stones associated with urinary tract infection were cultured using a method to distinguish between surface contamination and bacteria within the stone. Twenty three of 30 stones (77%) were infected mainly by Proteus mirabilis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and most were composed of struvite and/or apatite. Most oxalate and uric acid stones were sterile; occasionally the stones with positive culture had a non-urea-splitting bacteria and these were thought to have been infected secondarily. Some infected stones were studied by light microscopy scanning election microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. We found many rods in the interstices of crystals of struvite and apatite extensively from the nucleus to peripheral layers. These findings are important in the prevention and treatment of infection stones.
TI  - Effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria.
AB  - Two hundred and ninety-six bacterial isolates were investigated for the effects of saliva and alpha-amylase on their susceptibility to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and gentamicin. When the test organisms were primed with normal and 'diseased' saliva there were no observable differences in the MICs of ampicillin and chloramphenicol for group-A streptococci, but alpha-amylase significantly reduced the MIC of tetracycline from 2 to 0.25 mg/1. With Staphyloccus aureus, priming with saliva and alpha-amylase had no effect on the MICs of gentamicin and ampicillin, whereas the MICs of tetracycline and chloramphenicol were increased. The effect of saliva on the susceptibility of E. coli to tetracycline was also significant; MIC50 and MIC90 were reduced from 128 to 8 and 32 mg/1 respectively. Chloramphenicol was however increased from less than 0.125 to 1 and 2 mg/1 when E. coli was primed with amylase and saliva respectively. The general significance of these observations is discussed.
TI  - Chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Chemiluminescence (CL) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal CL response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the luminol-enhanced CL response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. We analyzed the CL response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees C. The CL response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees C. Variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced CL. Each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. In the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in CL: Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and zymosan. In the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The CL response also reflected serum opsonic activity. The effect of inactivated complement, factor B, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. Increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak CL; however, a strain of E. coli caused a variation in peak time rather than peak height. Different CL kinetics were shown for three strains of K. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or cell wall characteristics. This study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal CL response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteriology of branched renal calculi and accompanying urinary tract infection.
AB  - We determined the bacteriology of apparently infected renal calculi and accompanying urinary tract infections, and assessed the potential clinical value of the culture results. Twenty-two branched renal calculi from 16 patients were cultured. Fifteen calculi were infected with 1 or more urease-producing gram-negative enteric bacterium, 2 were infected with a urease-producing bacterium and a nonurease-producing organism, and 5 were sterile. Immersion of infected stones in antimicrobial solutions before culture reduced or eliminated surface bacteria but usually did not eradicate bacteria within the stone. The bacteriology of a stone or stones could be predicted on the basis of available urine culture results in only 2 of the 16 cases. These data suggest that branched renal calculi associated with bacteriuria usually are infected but that documentation of infection and identification of the infecting organism require culture of the stone.
TI  - Topical chlorhexidine diphosphanilate (WP-973) in burn wound sepsis.
AB  - We studied the diphosphanilate salt of chlorhexidine (WP-973), as a 2% cream, for therapeutic activity in two rat models of fatal burn wound infection. Control treatments were infection and placebo cream; infection only; infection and 1% sulfadiazine silver; and burning only. Activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Proteus mirabilis was tested in surface-inoculated rats with 20% scalds. Treatments were initiated 24 hours or four hours, respectively, after inoculation. Pseudomonas-infected rats were treated once a day for ten days. Proteus-infected rats were treated once a day for five days. In these experimental models, chlorhexidine diphosphanilate was equal to silver sulfadiazine, an established topical chemotherapeutic agent. In vitro activity was examined using bacteremia isolates from 65 burned patients. Using agar diffusion trench plates, chlorhexidine diphosphanilate was active against all strains. No evidence of cross-resistance between sulfonamide and chlorhexidine diphosphanilate or its components was observed.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro antibacterial activity of four oral cephems: cephalexin, cefaclor, cefatrizine and cefadroxil.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of four oral cephems: cephalexin, cefaclor, cefatrizine and cefadroxil against clinical isolates of staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was compared by agar dilution method. All drugs had comparable antistaphylococcal activity. Cefatrizine and cefaclor were more active than cephalexin and cefadroxil against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. All four drugs were relatively inactive against isolates of Enterobacter species and indole-positive Proteus. However, cefatrizine demonstrated the greatest activity of the four oral cephems against these organisms. None of these oral cephems was active against Serratia marcescens or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. MICs of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as MICs of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. Against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. Against Staphylococcus aureus. Haemophilus influenzae and the Bacteroides fragilis group the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. Piperacillin was more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Do antibody-coated bacteria reflect local immune response in the urinary tract?
AB  - We examined whether antibody-coated bacteria (ACB) reflect local immune response  or passive adsorption of immune globulins (Ig). For this purpose, bacterial subcultures from infected urines and third-party bacteria were incubated with Ig preparations. These were obtained from infected urine either by removal of Ig from ACB (dissociation in alpha-methylmannoside, 0.1 M glycine-HCl, or 3 M NaSCN) or by staphylococcal protein A affinity chromatography from the supernatant of infected urine. Coincubation of either Ig preparation with bacterial substrains of the original urine and with third-party strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, several Escherichia coli strains, enterococci, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus) caused coating of the bacterial surface with Ig. Coating was not measurably influenced by coincubation with various carbohydrates or by preincubation of bacteria with glucosidases. Adsorption of Ig was observed after heat denaturation and formalin treatment of bacteria and was independent of bacterial growth phase. Coating was observed both with intact IgG and with F(ab)2 fragments. We further examined the proportion of bacteria coated with IgA, IgG, and IgM in urines of 200 bacteriuric women with symptomatic urinary tract infection. The frequency histogram plot showed a continuous nonlinear unimodal distribution. Consequently, any selection of a 'normal range' is arbitrary. It is concluded that coating of the bacterial surface with Ig may not necessarily reflect local immune response. A major problem of the ACB test is definition of the normal range.
TI  - The effects of heparin on the adherence of five species of urinary tract pathogens to urinary bladder mucosa.
AB  - Previous studies performed in our laboratory have indicated that the primary antibacterial defense mechanism of the rabbit urinary bladder is the antiadsorptive action of the surface mucopolysaccharide. Removal of this layer with an acid rinse increases bacterial adherence up to 100 fold. Exogenous mucopolysaccharide (heparin) has been shown to restore Escherichia coli adherence to control levels. To determine whether this antiadherence action of heparin is species specific, we compared the adherence of 5 common urinary tract pathogens (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozonae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus fecalis) to both mucin intact and mucin deficient rabbit bladders with and without prior heparin exposure. Bacteria were radiolabeled by addition of 3H-adenine to the culture broth so that the number of bacteria adhering to the bladder could be determined using liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. Results were as follows: Acid removal of the mucin layer significantly increased the adherence approximately 10 fold for all 5 species tested. Briefly exposing the mucin deficient bladders to heparin decreased the adherence of all species tested except Pseudomonas to mucin intact control levels. Heparin treatment of mucin intact bladders slightly decreased adherence of all species except Pseudomonas below mucin intact controls, however, results were not statistically significant. The magnitude of Klebsiella adherence was nearly 20 fold greater than all other species tested. While this non-species specific adherence inhibition of heparin may prove useful in the clinical setting, it appears to be less effective against Pseudomonas.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of piperacillin versus carbenicillin for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - In this controlled, randomized clinical trial we compared piperacillin and carbenicillin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections. 24 patients received piperacillin 150 mg/kg/day for 7.2 +/- 2.75 days and 17 patients received carbenicillin 200 mg/kg/day for 7.5 +/- 2.90 days. Patients were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic responses and tolerance to therapy. Although the clinical cure rate significantly favored carbenicillin treatment (p less than 0.01), the sum of the percentages of cases with clinical cure and clinical improvement were similar between groups: 91.6% for piperacillin and 88.2% for carbenicillin. The bacteriologic cure rates for piperacillin and carbenicillin patients (54.1 and 47.0%, respectively) were not significantly different (p greater than 0.05). The low cure rates in our study were probably the result of uncorrected/uncorrectable genitourinary tract abnormalities. Superinfections developed in 12.5 and 17.6% of piperacillin and carbenicillin patients, respectively, and were due to Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, side effects were mild, reversible, and did not require discontinuation of treatment. However, carbenicillin caused elevations in liver enzymes more frequently than piperacillin (p less than 0.05). Based on our data, we recommend reserving piperacillin monotherapy for patients who are poor candidates for aminoglycosides, or are on severe sodium restriction, and have serious complicated urinary tract infections due to susceptible organisms. We do not recommend piperacillin alone for empiric treatment of complicated urinary tract infections.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of cefoperazone].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefoperazone (CPZ) against clinical isolates including various beta-lactamase-producing strains were studied and compared with those of cefotiam (CTM). CPZ had a broad spectrum against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Especially, CPZ showed apparently more potent antibacterial activities than CTM against Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, CPZ was less active than CTM against Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. The stability and affinity of CPZ for various types of beta-lactamase were also studied. CPZ was more resistant to hydrolysis by typical cephalosporinase (CSase) and cefuroximase (CXase) than CTM, but was less stable to penicillinase (PCase). CPZ often showed higher affinity to beta-lactamases than CTM. The study for the inducer-activity revealed that CPZ hardly induced CSase production in E. cloacae and Proteus vulgaris while CTM highly induced in both strains. CPZ was more active against CSase-producers than CTM, especially against strains which inducibly produced the enzyme. It was speculated that this activity was responsible for the superior stability to CSase and low inducer-activity for CSase production.
TI  - Pathogenic organisms in chronic suppurative otitis media in Enugu, Nigeria.
AB  - Pathogenic organisms in chronic suppurative otitis media from 62 patients were identified. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was responsible in 46%, Staphylococcus aureus in 29%. Proteus mirabilis in 13%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 6%, Aspergillus niger in 5% and Mucor sp. in 2%. The most prevalent organism in children was Staphylococcus aureus. The role of fungi in chronic suppurative otitis media is discussed.
TI  - A microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis. Using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. A regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. The results on Mueller-Hinton agar are very similar to those on Iso-Sensitest medium. Like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. Strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.
TI  - In vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas sp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. The majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. Although most Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and Bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. Activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. Enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. Enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid pH than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. There was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. Resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of canine urinary bacteria to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted on bacteria that were isolated  from urine specimens collected by antepubic cystocentesis from dogs with urinary tract infections. Antimicrobics to which greater than or equal to 90% of these urinary bacteria were susceptible in vitro included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Escherichia coli; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Proteus mirabilis; ampicillin chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of coagulase-positive staphylococci; cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Streptococcus faecalis, Str faecium, and Str zymogenes; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Str viridans; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of Str canis. No antimicrobial agent tested was effective in vitro at the 90% level for isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but gentamicin was closest, at 89%.
TI  - Routine use of BACTEC 16B bottles to remove antibacterial and antitumor agents from blood cultures of cancer patients.
AB  - A total of 1,764 paired sets of BACTEC 6B and 16B blood culture bottles were collected from patients for analysis. The majority of the patients were receiving antibiotic therapy at the time the blood specimens were collected. A total of 126 isolates were considered clinically significant. Of these, 58 grew in both 6B and 16B bottles, 25 grew only in 6B bottles, and 43 grew only in 16B bottles. In both bottles, the same amount of time was required to detect a positive culture. In 18 patients, septicemias were detected in the 16B bottles that were not detected in the 6B bottles. In seven patients, microorganisms were detected in the 6B bottles that were not detected in the 16B bottles. Interestingly, the antibiotic therapy was changed for only 4 of the 18 patients whose septicemias were detected only in the 16B bottles. Finally, an in vitro study showed that certain chemotherapeutic agents can cause the inhibition of growth of several microorganisms when tested in 6B bottles. These inhibitory effects were reduced or eliminated when the same organism-drug combinations were tested in 16B bottles.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and microbial susceptibility studies of ceftriaxone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was tested  against 450 strains isolated from blood cultures and compared with that of various other antibiotics. The compound was comparable to cefotaxime for all species tested. It was more potent than cefoperazone, cefamandole and ticarcillin in inhibiting Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp. and Serratia marcescens). The MIC95 of ceftriaxone for these strains was 0.5 microgram/ml. The drug was less active against Staphylococcus aureus than cefamandole, cloxacillin and vancomycin, but most isolates were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftriaxone was comparable in activity to ticarcillin (MIC95 = 64 micrograms/ml), and inferior to cefoperazone, ceftazidime and cefsulodine. Levels of ceftriaxone in serum and various body fluids were determined by bio-assays. Due to its very long half-life (8 h), ceftriaxone serum levels 24 h after i.v. or i.m. injection of 1 and 2 g were still above the MIC95 of all strains tested except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Levels in bile, synovial and cerebro-spinal fluids were high.
TI  - The turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
AB  - Ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 Klett-Summerson Colorimeter Units. The suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Turbidities for Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. Staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. Overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
TI  - Superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  - We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.). Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - Nosocomial urinary tract infections: secular trends, treatment and economics in a university hospital.
AB  - During a 71-month interval 3,024 nosocomial urinary tract infections were identified by prospective surveillance at our hospital. The annual attack rate varied between 2.0 and 3.1 per 100 admissions. Gram-negative bacilli caused 74 per cent of all urinary infections and recurrent infections in the hospital accounted for only 1 per cent. The most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli (24 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis (7 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 per cent) and Proteus mirabilis (6 per cent). Candida species caused 10 per cent of the infections and may represent a hospital-acquired pathogen of increasing importance. The burn unit had a significantly higher proportion of Enterobacter infections (21 per cent) than any other service (p less than 0.05). The plastic surgery service had more Serratia infections (24 per cent), whereas obstetrics and gynecology had more Escherichia coli infections (47 per cent) relative to other hospital services. More than 99 per cent of the patients with nosocomial urinary tract infections received antimicrobial drugs; in 63 per cent the chart documented that drug therapy was prescribed specifically for treatment of the urinary infections. Hospital-acquired urinary infections added approximately 1 million dollars to hospital expenses during the study interval. Estimates were made of the economic benefits of successful control programs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aztreonam: a synthetic monobactam. A comparative study  with thirteen other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of aztreoman (SQ 26, 776), a new monocyclic beta-lactam antimicrobial agent, was determined against 1720 bacteria, all clinical isolates, and compared with that of thirteen beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam inhibited 90% of Citrobacter diversus, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella sp. by less than or equal to 0.4 micrograms ml-1. This activity was superior to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cefsulodin, ceftazidime and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aztreonam was as active as moxalactam against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Shigella species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to moxalactam, piperacillin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefsulodin and ceftazidime were inhibited by aztreonam 50% by 6.3 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 16 micrograms ml-1. Aztreonam was as active as ceftazidime against Serratia marcescens, all strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms ml-1 and 90% by 1.6 micrograms ml-1. There was no major difference between MBC and MIC values of aztreonam and the effect of inoculum size upon MIC values was observed at 10(7) CFU.
TI  - Use of rifampin for the treatment of serious staphylococcal and gram-negative bacillary infections.
AB  - The use of rifampin combined with other antimicrobial agents for the treatment of 40 serious bacterial infections against which other treatment regimens had failed was reviewed. Seven of 17 staphylococcal infections (16 due to Staphylococcus aureus and one due to Staphylococcus epidermidis) were cured, as were 16 of 23 infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. In vitro tests of interaction between rifampin and other antibiotics produced variable results. However, eight rifampin-resistant strains (six of S. aureus, one of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one of Proteus mirabilis) emerged during combination therapy in seven patients; the drugs involved were rifampin plus vancomycin in three instances, rifampin plus gentamicin in two, rifampin plus colistin in one, and rifampin plus pristinamycin in one. Thus, while rifampin produced a dramatic beneficial effect in some patients with serious bacterial infections, the emergence of resistant strains, even with dual drug therapy, was identified as a potential problem.
TI  - Studies on beta-lactam antibiotics. VII. Effect on antibacterial activity of the  oxime O-substituents with various functional groups in the 7 beta-[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-oxyiminoacetamido]cephalosporins.
AB  - The synthesis and in vitro activity of the 7-[O-substituted oxyiminoacetamido]cephalosporins (I) without substitution at 3-position of a cephem nucleus are described. Effect of changing the oxime O-substituents (R1) with various functional groups in the 7-acyl residue on antibacterial activity was examined. Against Gram-positive bacteria, cephems with hydrophilic functions in the R1 moiety such as hydroxyethyl, aminoethyl and carboxymethyl groups showed decrease of the activity, while cephems with lipophilic functions such as cyanomethyl, methylthiomethyl and halogenoethyl groups exhibited increase of the activity. However, influence of the substituents (R1) on activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed to be relatively independent of the nature of their functional groups.
TI  - Evaluation of ceftazidime in the treatment of severe bacterial infection.
AB  - We investigated the clinical efficiency and safety of ceftazidime for treatment of 33 episodes of infection in 30 patients (17 males and 13 females), whose ages ranged from 9 to 92 years (mean 52.5). Fourteen patients had ultimately fatal disease and the remaining 16 had non-fatal diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the beginning of treatment was critical or poor in 16 cases. Episodes of infection treated were: 24 urinary tract infections (eight of them with concomitant bacteraemia), seven wound infections (one with concomitant bacteraemia and three with osteomyelitis), and two episodes of pneumonia. Twenty-nine episodes of infection were monomicrobial and the four remaining ones were polymicrobial. Significant organisms isolated were all aerobic or facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative rods and were responsible for the following episodes of infection: Escherichia coli (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Pseudomonas cepacia (1), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (2), Klebsiella (2), Enterobacter aerogenes (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). Total dosage of ceftazidime ranged from 28 to 240 g (mean 82.4 g), and mean duration of therapy was 17 days (range 8 to 44 days). The overall rate of clinical response to ceftazidime was 91%. Local and general tolerance to the drug was excellent. Enterococcal and/or candida colonization occurred in 12 episodes (36%) and superinfections by the same micro-organisms occurred in three episodes. Ceftazidime seems to be an effective and safe single agent for therapy of many bacterial infections, including those caused by Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - Sensitization of Gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics and complement by a nontoxic oligopeptide.
AB  - A major virulence factor of bacteria that cause generalized infections is their resistance to the lytic action of the complement cascade, an important defence mechanism of the host. Invasive Gram-negative enteric bacteria, which cause about one-third of all bacteraemic infections, are completely resistant to lysis by complement, even in the presence of hyperimmune serum. The same bacteria are also resistant to many antibiotics that are effective therapeutic agents against other bacteria, as the outermost surface layer (the outer membrane) of the bacteria functions as a permeability barrier. Here we show that it is possible to sensitize such bacteria to both complement and antibiotics by using an agent that binds to the outer membrane. This agent is a nontoxic derivative of polymyxin which by itself has no bactericidal action.
TI  - Comparative study of fosfomycin activity in Mueller-Hinton media and in tissues.
AB  - Fosfomycin utilizes two uptake systems as ways of entry into microorganisms: the  L-a-glycerophosphate and the hexose phosphate transport system. The latter is inducible by glucose-6-phosphate. The relationship between glucose-6-phosphate (concentration range 0-100 mg/l) and the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus was studied in Mueller-Hinton broth. An almost maximal enhancement of fosfomycin activity was found at 25 mg/l glucose-6-phosphate. Fosfomycin activity against Staph. aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied by use of the broth and the agar dilution method, in the presence and absence of glucose-6-phosphate (25 mg/l). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of fosfomycin against Staph. aureus Streptococcus faecalis, E. coli, Ent. cloacae, Pr. mirabilis, and Ps. aeruginosa were estimated in particle free supernatants of 25% tissue homogenates (liver, kidney, lung, heart) and in parallel in Mueller-Hinton broth. With few exceptions the MICs in Mueller-Hinton broth (with glucose-6-phosphate) were similar to those found in tissues (no glucose-6-phosphate added).
TI  - Effect of estrogen-promoted bacterial infections of the rat uterus on bioassay of mammalian cell growth factor activities in uterine luminal fluid.
AB  - Exogenous estradiol treatment of intact or ovariectomized rats causes accumulation of significant volumes of fluid in the uterine horns. In this report, evidence is presented showing the presence of mammalian cell growth factor(s) in uterine luminal fluid (ULF), along with other data showing that the exogenous estradiol treatment needed to cause significant accumulation of the fluid also facilitates the movement of vaginal origin bacteria into the uterine horns. It is shown that microorganisms infect the uteri of 80% or more of rats administered exogenous estradiol, and that the microorganisms are most probably of vaginal origin; procedures such as ligation of the uterine body above the cervix or antibiotic treatment did not suppress the infections. Administration of different doses of exogenous estrogen by either implantation of a single 25-mg estradiol/cholesterol pellet which causes a 20- to 50-fold elevation of estradiol levels above physiological plasma concentrations, or instead, by a Silastic tube delivery method that elevates levels only 2- to 3-fold above the normal range, resulted in equal frequency of uterine infections and in the appearance of infection at the same time after starting treatment. A number of bacterial species are present in the contaminated ULF, and these are the origins of intracellular products which are potent inhibitors of mammalian cell growth; the presence of these bacterial origin inhibitors interferes with the bioassay of the ULF growth factor activity, and hence, impedes the characterization of the growth factor(s) present in luminal fluid. Characterization of the origins of the growth-inhibiting activities showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are the predominant species present in infected uteri and that both produce exotoxin activities which inhibit growth of mammalian cells in culture; Pseudomonas appears to be the greater producer of cytotoxic activity. Evidence is presented that suggests that the well-known Exotoxin A produced by Pseudomonas may be responsible, in part, for the toxic effects of this organism. Other, as yet unidentified, cell growth inhibitors also may be produced by the bacteria found in ULF. Surgical separation of the uterine body from the cervix allows preparation of ULF which contains no bacteria and substantially reduced levels of growth inhibitors to mammalian cell lines.
TI  - A scanning electron microscopic study of urine droppers and urine collecting systems.
AB  - In this study we have shown extensive microbial colonization of the surface of urine droppers and urine collecting systems from bacteriuric patients. In all instances there was an extensive background matrix and fibrous strands interconnected the bacteria. A "slime" layer completely encased bacteria on occasion. These observations suggest that incorporation of blockers of bacterial adhesion into the surfaces of these devices should be explored as one method of delaying, or in some cases preventing, catheter-acquired bacteriuria.
TI  - [Resistance spectrum of various bacteria against cefotiam in 3 Berlin clinics].
AB  - The in vitro activity of Cefotiam (Spizef) was tested using the agar diffusion test method according to DIN 58940 and compared with the antibacterial activity of 12 other routinely tested antibacterial chemotherapeutics. A total of 3000 strains from patients' specimens from the University Hospital of the Free University of Berlin and the Municipal Wenckebach Hospital, West Berlin, was tested. Cefotiam proved effective against strains of Staphylococcus aureus in 99,4%, Escherichia coli in 99,7%, Klebsiella species in 97,8%, Enterobacter species in 90,3%, Proteus mirabilis in 98,7%, indolpositive Proteus species in 91,7%, Citrobacter in 92,6%, and beta-hemolytic Streptococci in 99,3% of all strains tested. There were only few sensitive strains of Enterococci and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Susceptibility of blood isolates to various antibiotics, in particular to cephalosporins.
AB  - Of 760 bacterial pathogens isolated from blood cultures of acutely ill patients in a general hospital in Hong Kong for 1 year, 69.9% of the isolates were Gram-negative aerobes mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.0% were Gram-positive aerobes mainly Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci and 8.1% were anaerobes mainly Bacteroides spp. The susceptibility of the aerobic isolates to various antibiotics was tested. Ampicillin was found to be active mainly against the enterococci and some other Gram-positive organisms while most isolates of Staph. aureus and the Gram-negative bacteria were resistant. In contrast, cephalothin was found only slightly less active than the second generation cephalosporins against Gram-negative blood isolates but considerably more active against Staph. aureus and other Gram-positive isolates. The three aminoglycosides tested, i.e., gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, showed similar good activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, but amikacin had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting most of the other Gram-negative isolates as well as isolates of Staph. aureus. The third generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, latamoxef (moxalactam), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, all had a high activity against the Gram-negative but a reduced activity against the Gram-positive bacteria. Ceftazidime had the broadest spectrum of activity in inhibiting all the Gram-negative isolates including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while cefotaxime showed the best overall activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative blood isolates.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of azlocillin: a community hospital study of 1900 clinical  isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of azlocillin was evaluated against 1900 fresh clinical isolates from a 320-bed community hospital. Azlocillin inhibited over 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at less than or equal to 16 mg/l; it was four-fold more active than ticarcillin and 8- to 16-fold more active than carbenicillin. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae azlocillin was less active than piperacillin but still inhibited over 90% of Klebsiella, Serratia and Proteus mirabilis at achievable blood levels (less than or equal to 64 mg/l). It was the most active agent against enterococci inhibiting 80% at less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Azlocillin will be a useful addition to the antibiotic formulary of the community hospital because of its exceptional anti-pseudomonal activity.
TI  - [Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sensitivity to antibiotics and their combinations when cultured together].
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity of Ps. aeruginosa associated with Proteus was lower than that of Ps. aeruginosa monocultures. This might result to some extent from interrelationships between Ps. aeruginosa and Proteus. Tobramycin, gentamicin and cephotaxim (claforan) proved to be the most active against Proteus cultures isolated from the associations. Eight combinations of gentamicin and tobramycin with carbenicillin, ampicillin or cephotaxim were tested. It was shown that the activity of all the combinations with respect to Ps. aeruginosa and Proteus was almost the same. No indifference or antagonism was observed. The combinations may be recommended for clinical use.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new 7 alpha-methoxycephem antibiotic, was fundamentally and clinically studied, and the following results were obtained. The antibacterial activities of T-1982 against clinical isolates of S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were determined in comparison with those of CER, CEZ, CMZ and CTT. Against S. aureus, CER and CEZ exhibited excellent activity, whereas T-1982 was less active with the peak MIC of 12.5 micrograms/ml even with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. The activity of T-1982 was equal to that of CTT and by far superior to that of CER, CEZ and CMZ against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, the peak MICs with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml being less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml, less than or equal to 0.1-0.2 microgram/ml and 0.2-0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. Against S. marcescens, T-1982 was superior to CMZ and CTT and 48% of the strains were inhibited by 3.13 micrograms/ml or less, whereas all the strains were resistant to CER and CEZ. The MIC of T-1982 against most strains of P. aeruginosa was more than 100 micrograms/ml. 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of T-1982 was administered by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion to 23 pediatric patients to measure serum levels and urinary recovery. At 30 minutes after one shot injection of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, the highest serum levels of 22.0-38.8 micrograms/ml and 52.4-80 micrograms/ml were observed, the half-lives being 1.32 hours and 1.76 hours. When given by 1 hour drip infusion, the serum levels attained the peaks of 29.2-42.6 micrograms/ml and 49.0-75.6 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, the half-lives being 1.24 hours and 1.19 hours. The urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 74.2-92.5% and 50.2-66.5% by one shot injection and 63.4-84.2% and 53.9-79.0% by drip infusion. T-1982 was administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg by 30 minutes drip infusion to a child with purulent meningitis. The levels of T-1982 in the cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour after administration were 4.8-6.7 micrograms/ml with the CSF/serum ratios of 4.4-8.4%. A total of 36 pediatric patients (21 cases of respiratory tract infection, 9 cases of urinary tract infection and each 1 case of purulent cervical lymphadenitis, scarlet fever, purulent meningitis, acute colitis, peritonitis and sinusitis) was treated with 40-80 mg/kg/day of T-1982 (252.6 mg/kg/day in purulent meningitis). The response was excellent in 27 patients and good in 7 patients, the efficacy rate being 94.4%. Diarrhea or eruption were observed in each 1 case. No abnormal laboratory findings were noted in any cases.
TI  - Simple additives to increase the activity of chlorhexidine digluconate against urinary pathogens.
AB  - The concentration of chlorhexidine digluconate required to kill Gram-negative bacteria which cause urinary tract infection associated with urethral catheterisation also damages the bladder mucosa. Increased bactericidal activity was obtained by the addition of a chelating agent (EDTA) and a buffer (Tris) enabling a low concentration of chlorhexidine (0.01 per cent) to be effective against Escherichia coli NCTC 86, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 7650 Proteus mirabilis NCTC 8309 and Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 8213. The type of fluid in which the bacteria were suspended affected the time required to achieve 99.9 per cent killing. The 0.01 per cent chlorhexidine solution with added EDTA and Tris did not cause severe erosive damage to the bladder mucosa of rats. The potential of this solution for use as a skin antiseptic prior to catheterisation and as a bladder instillation after catheterisation is discussed.
TI  - Endemic resistance to amikacin among hospital isolates of gram-negative bacilli:  implications for therapy.
AB  - We reviewed the records of the microbiology laboratory of the Veterans Administration Medical Center, Bronx, New York in order to determine the prevalence, epidemiology and complete antibiotic susceptibility profile of amikacin-resistant aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli isolated from clinical specimens submitted for culture between January 1, 1980 and May 1, 1981. Of more than 5000 gram-negative rods isolated during this 16-month period, 2.8% were determined to be resistant to amikacin by the disc diffusion method. Eighty-eight of the amikacin-resistant organisms were unique isolates derived from cultures on 74 patients located throughout the hospital. Urine (51%) and sputum (27%) were the predominant sources of specimens yielding resistant strains. These organisms represented seven different genera of Enterobacteriaceae (58%) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31%) and other glucose non-fermenting species (11%). Resistance to amikacin was usually associated with resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin and most of the other antimicrobials tested. Twenty percent of isolates were susceptible to only a single antimicrobial, and another 5% were resistant to every agent routinely tested. Although geographic clustering of a small number of amikacin-resistant organisms occurred twice (a strain of Proteus mirabilis on the spinal cord injury service and a strain of P. aeruginosa on one medical ward), the vast majority of isolations were consistent with a pattern of endemic resistance.
TI  - Biocidal braided sutures.
AB  - Once sutures become contaminated it is difficult for local tissue defenses or antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria and prevent infection. Impregnation of sutures with antibiotics before implantation is one way to prevent bacterial seeding of the suture surface. In this study, braided silk and Dacron sutures were impregnated with the antibiotic complex, neomycin palmitate. Using our standard wound model in the mouse, the efficacy of these biocidal sutures was determined in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Implantation of these biocidal sutures into tissue contaminated with 10(7) organisms resulted in substantially decreased numbers of bacteria as compared with that of tissue receiving control sutures. In most cases, the tissue bacterial counts in the presence of biocidal sutures were also considerably lower than that for similarly contaminated tissue without a suture. Consequently, the presence of the neomycin palmitate eliminated the infection-potentiating effect of the suture. The therapeutic benefit of the biocidal sutures was related to the dose of antibiotic complex and was not adversely affected by delaying suture implantation.
TI  - [Effect of multiresistance on the minimal inhibitory concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin and 6 comparing substances against P. aeruginosa and 4 Enterobacteriaceae species].
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of multiresistant strains of P. aeruginosa and four species of Enterobacteriaceae were compared with those of more sensitive ones in N-f-thienamycin and six other antibiotics. The greatest difference between these two differently resistant bacterial populations was found in cefoperazone and the beta-lactamase-instable piperacillin. The latter was used for comparison purposes. The activity of cefsulodin was distinctly reduced in multiresistant strains of P. aeruginosa. Cefotaxime and lamoxactam displayed slightly elevated MICs in multiresistant strains. In N-f-thienamycin a significant difference between the multiresistant and the more sensitive population could not be verified (p greater than 0.05). In this regard it resembles fosfomycin. beta-lactam antibiotics could be ranked by means of correlation analysis of their MICs. Using piperacillin as a reference antibiotic the following order of succession could be arranged according to correlation coefficients in P. aeruginosa: cefoperazone, cefsulodin, lamoxactam, cefotaxime and N-f-thienamycin. For the Enterobacteriaceae species some antibiotics could not be evaluated in this test. Moreover, it was recognized that there was an obvious correlation between the activities of lamoxactam and cefotaxime in P. aeruginosa (r = 0.81) and E. coli (r = 0.80). A correlation was also observed between those of cefsulodin and cefoperazone in P. aeruginosa (r = 0.75). Lower correlation coefficients were seen in N-f-thienamycin with cefoperazone, piperacillin and cefsulodin in P. aeruginosa and with cefoperazone in Klebsiella spec.. Notwithstanding, strains resistant to cefsulodin and cefoperazone were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml of N-f-thienamycin. These results showed that in N-f-thienamycin, cefotaxime and lamoxactam multiresistance has only a minimal influence on the MICs of the species of Enterobacteriaceae examined. For therapeutic considerations concerning multiresistance the small differences recognized among these three antibiotics might be without significance. However, N-f-thienamycin was distinctly more active in multiresistant strains of P. aeruginosa than the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility of the skin infections bacterium to some antimicrobial agents].
AB  
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefotaxime].
AB  - Susceptibilities of 737 strains of 19 species of bacteria to cefotaxime (CTX) were determined based on the inhibition zone diameter obtained by the single-disc method. Four categories were assessed. 1. Susceptibility of clinical isolates to CTX and 6 other antibiotics Against most strains, CTX showed higher antibacterial activity than other drugs (CET, ABPC, SBPC, CMZ, GM, AMK), especially for S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae. Furthermore, CTX was more active than the other antibiotics against E. coli, Indole (+) Proteus, P. mirabilis, Klebsiella sp., S. marcescens, H. influenzae and E. cloacae. 2. Susceptibility of strains isolated from different clinical materials CTX showed the highest antibacterial activity against most strains isolated from sputum, urine, pus, blood and cerebrospinal fluid. However, CTX was occasionally less than potent AMK and GM against strains isolated from bile. Against P. aeruginosa strains derived from clinical materials, the following results were obtained: AMK greater than CFS, FOM greater than CTX greater than GM greater than SBPC 3. Susceptibility of clinical isolates in 7 different fields CTX was the most active antibiotic tested in the fields of internal medicine, pediatrics, urology, obstetrics & gynecology, dermatology and otorhinolaryngology. But in surgery, CTX was less potent than GM and AMK. 4. Susceptibility of clinical isolates of inpatients and outpatients CTX showed excellent activity against many beta-lactamase resistant strains isolated from patients.
TI  - Transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Six transtracheal aspirations (TTA) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. Specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria and TTA aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. Differences in bacteria isolated in TTA and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. Six isolates were recovered in both sites (three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus aureus and one Aspergillus flavus). Five aerobic isolates were recovered only in the expectorated sputum and not in TTA aspirations (two Klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Nine organisms were isolated only from the TTA (two each of Veillonella parvula and Alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Lactobacillus sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Gamma hemolytic streptococci). The recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six TTA specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. We found TTA to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Cefotetan: profile of in-vitro activity.
AB  - Cefotetan, a novel 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin, was shown to be comparable to other third-generation cephalosporins when tested in vitro against 1063 Gram-negative clinical isolates of 11 species. Ninety per cent of all isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter freundii were inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan between 0.07 and 3.2 mg/l. Activity against Gram-positive cocci was about equal to that of moxalactam. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter were resistant. Cefotetan inhibited about two-thirds of Enterobacter strains at 16 mg/l. beta-Lactamases of Enterobacter cloacae highly resistant to cefotetan inactivated this cephamycin. These strains were resistant to most other beta-lactams as well. Synergism between cefotetan and aminoglycosides was found in 8 out of 16 Gram-negatives.
TI  - Carbenicillin-hydrolyzing penicillinases of Proteus mirabilis and the PSE-type penicillinases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Three carbenicillin-hydrolyzing penicillinases were found in Proteus mirabilis strains, N-3, N-29, and GN79. The former two strains were isolated in 1978, but strain GN79 was one of our stock cultures isolated in 1965. These penicillinases closely resembled each other, and the PSE-1 and PSE-4 enzymes produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in their substrate profiles and kinetic properties for hydrolyzing various beta-lactams. However, differences were found in their molecular weights and isoelectric points which ranged from 22,000 to 27,000 and from 6.0 to 6.9, respectively. The antiserum against the purified penicillinase of N-29 cross-reacted with the enzyme of N-3 and inhibited its activity by more than 80%. The antiserum also reacted with the PSE-1 and PSE-4 enzymes. The antiserum did not react with the penicillinase from strain GN79 and the PSE-2 and PSE-3 enzymes of P. aeruginosa. Enzyme production in N-3 and N-29 was mediated by R plasmids.
TI  - [Microbial colonization of the nasopharynx, external auditory canal, hair of the  head and armpit in high performance swimmers].
AB  - From 50 high-performance swimmers, who were subdivided into three training groups, swabs were taken before and after the swimming training from the nose, throat and the external auditory canal, and bacterial samples were taken according to the Rodac method from the hair of the head and the armpit for a quantitative and qualitative analysis. - No significant quantitation differences were found to exist in the bacterial flora before and after the swimming training, except for the external auditory canal where the bacterial population had increased, and the armpit where it had diminished. - A qualitative comparison of the normal flora revealed no noticeable differences in the population before and after the swimming training for the three training groups. - However, differences in the pathogenic flora were identified in the three training groups. A higher germ count was found in those swimmers who had been training more intensely for a longer period of time than the members of a junior training group. This finding is particularly striking for P. aeruginosa which was located in the ears of those high-performance swimmers who belonged to the group with the most intensive swimming training. The carriers of Staph. aureus accounted for 46 per cent of the test persons. This species had primarily settled in the vestibule of the nose. - The swimming training hardly influences the invasion of the hair of the head with pathogens. The compulsory use of bathing cap serves general hygienic aspects rather than prophylactic hygienic purposes.
TI  - Organic acids and anaerobic microorganisms in the contents of the cholesteatoma sac.
AB  - Organic acids in the contents of the cholesteatoma sac from 28 cases were studied by gas chromatographic technique. Five volatile fatty acids (acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate and isovalerate) and lactate were detected in large amounts, which may lower the pH of the cholesteatoma content. These acids were considered to be derived from products of anaerobic microorganisms. Therefore, the contents from 12 cases were cultured anaerobically in a glove box. Obligate microorganisms were identified in 92% of the cases and Peptococcus, Bacteroides, and Clostridium species were frequently isolated. In vitro, such obligate anaerobes produced various organic acids from the cholesteatoma content. Facultatives such as Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis produced acetate in the content under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereas no organic acid was produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Organic acids in the cholesteatoma content could be fermentative products made by the microorganisms, anaerobes and facultatives, which use the content as a substrate for acid production.
TI  - Ceftriaxone - a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin. In vitro activity against gram-negative bacilli sensitive and resistant to gentamicin.
AB  - Ceftriaxone (Rocephin 13-9904) was tested against 409 isolates of gram-negative bacilli. No difference was found in the susceptibility of the 262 gentamicin-sensitive or 147 gentamicin-resistant isolates to ceftriaxone. Comparison with other third-generation cephalosporins showed that ceftriaxone was as active as or more active than lamoxactam, cefoperazone, cefotaxime and ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp., Klebsiella. Ceftriaxone was not as active as ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than lamoxactam, cefoperazone and cefotaxime.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of norfloxacin.
AB  - Norfloxacin, a new quinoline derivative, was studied in vitro, and determinations of agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and broth dilution MICs and MBCs were made. Nalidixic acid and cinoxacin were used as comparative agents. Norfloxacin was found to be extremely active against all strains tested of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp. Serratia spp., Citrobacter spp., and Enterobacter spp., with MICs normally below 1 microgram/ml. It also was found to be highly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococci, which are all resistant to nalidixic acid and cinoxacin. The MICs for norfloxacin obtained by broth dilution were slightly higher than those obtained by agar dilution, whereas the reverse was true for nalidixic acid and cinoxacin. The MBCs of norfloxacin were only slightly higher than the MICs, even at high inocula. The in vitro activity of norfloxacin was not dependent on the inoculum size, whereas both the MICs and the MBCs of nalidixic acid increased markedly for many of the strains tested when the inoculum was increased in broth dilution from 10(3) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. Norfloxacin seems to be a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of urinary tract infections, especially those caused by Pseudomonas spp. and other species today requiring the use of injectable antibiotics.
TI  - A prospective microbiologic study of bacteriuria in patients with chronic indwelling urethral catheters.
AB  - Bacteriuria is common in chronically catheterized patients and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. Of 605 consecutive weekly urine specimens from 20 chronically catheterized patients, 98% contained bacteria at high concentrations and 77% were polymicrobial. The mean interval between new episodes of bacteriuria was 1.8 weeks. Most species of bacteria caused five to seven new episodes of bacteriuria per 100 weeks of catheterization. Even though access to the catheter lumen was similar, the duration of bacteriuric episodes varied greatly by species. Of the episodes of bacteriuria caused by nonenterococcal gram-positive cocci, greater than 75% lasted less than one week. Mean durations of episodes of bacteriuria due to Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were four to six weeks, whereas those due to Providencia stuartii averaged 10 weeks and ranged up to 36 weeks. Thus, the very high prevalence of bacteriuria--virtually 100%--was a result of a high incidence caused by many different species combined with the prolonged residence of some gram-negative bacilli in the catheter and urinary tract.
TI  - pHH502, a plasmid with IncP and IncI alpha characters, loses the latter by a specific recA-independent deletion event.
AB  - Plasmid pHH502, of molecular weight 70 X 10(6), determined resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, sulphonamides and mercuric chloride and was incompatible with members of IncP and IncI alpha. It resembled other plasmids of IncI alpha in the following properties: it determined pili that were morphologically and serologically I alpha pili, whose production was repressed in established plasmid-carrying (R+) cultures; its transfer was equally efficient in liquid or on solid medium; it exerted surface exclusion against other IncI alpha plasmids; it was non-transferable to Proteus. In a reproducible, recA-independent event, pHH502 gave rise to pHH502-1, a plasmid of molecular weight 40 X 10(6), lacking determinants for resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol and all detectable IncI alpha characteristics. pHH502-1 was incompatible only with IncP plasmids and resembled other IncP plasmids in determining constitutive production of rigid pili, in its surface exclusion, in transferring at greater frequency on solid than in liquid medium and in being transmissible to Proteus mirabilis. It differed from other IncP plasmids in the morphology and serological type of its pili and in failing to transfer to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Small numbers of pHH502-1 rigid pili were present on bacteria carrying pHH502. Possible mechanisms for the generation of pHH502 and pHH502-1 are discussed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of DL-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  - DL-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. The activity of DL-8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. DL-8280 had greater activity against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and Bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to DL-8280. The activity of DL-8280 was affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. Administered orally to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, or P. aeruginosa, DL-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefmenoxime in pediatric field].
AB  
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefmenoxime in pediatric field].
AB  - Basic and clinical studies were made on cefmenoxime (CMX) in pediatric field, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of CMX against clinically isolated and maintained strains was examined. CMX had stronger antibacterial activity than CEZ against Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but CEZ had stronger antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. 2. The blood concentrations of CMX, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a one-shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg of CMX were 33.6, 15.1, 4.5, 2.5 and 0.6 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-life of 1.04 hours. 3. The blood concentrations of CMX, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after a 1-hour intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg of CMX were 32.0, 55.2, 8.4, 4.2 and 1.0 mcg/ml, respectively, with the half-lite of 0.96 hour. 4. A complete or partial clinical response to therapy with CMX was obtained in all 10 children with infectious diseases. 5. Bacteriological examination made on 3 patients showed that all bacteria had been eradicated, and that therapy was effective. The bacteria were E. coli in 2 patients and Proteus mirabilis in 1 patient. 6. The side effects produced were neutropenia, eosinophilia and skin eruption in 1 patient, and diarrhea in 1 patient.
TI  - Preliminary report comparing piperacillin and carbenicillin for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Piperacillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against common gram-negative urinary tract pathogens. We compared the efficacy and safety of piperacillin versus carbenicillin in patients with complicated urinary tract infection. A total of 56 adult patients (mean age 55 years) in stable medical condition with 1 or more structural genitourinary abnormalities entered the study. Of these patients 27 were evaluated for antibiotic efficacy. There were 20 lower tract and 7 upper tract infections, of which 17 were acute and 10 were chronic. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: 17 patients with 18 organisms received single agent treatment with 181 mg. per kg. intravenous piperacillin daily for 6 days and 10 patients with 11 organisms received 270 mg. per kg. intravenous carbenicillin daily for 6 days. Infecting organisms were Escherichia coli 45 per cent, Proteus mirabilis 14 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae 14 per cent. Enterobacter species 10 per cent, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7 per cent and so forth. Antimicrobial susceptibility assessed by measurement of minimal inhibitory concentration and disk diffusion zone size demonstrated superior activity of piperacillin over carbenicillin for most micro-organisms tested. All patients responded clinically. The bacteriologic cure rate was 72 per cent at 5 to 9 days after therapy in both groups. Three patients who received piperacillin had urosepsis and were cured. No resistance emerged during therapy. Superinfections developed in 5 patients on carbenicillin (50 per cent) and in 4 patients on piperacillin (24 per cent), and none was resistant to piperacillin. Superinfections were attributed to catheterization and structural genitourinary abnormalities. The over-all incidence of adverse effects in patients on piperacillin was less than that of those on carbenicillin, 31 and 51 per cent respectively. Side effects in both groups were mild and did not require discontinuation of therapy. There were no significant alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance, or hematologic or renal function.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for H. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against H. influenzae; it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. It was also the most active agent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Cefotaxime was among the most active agents against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter species, Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. None of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.
TI  - Determination of the range of antibacterial activity by use of viable counts.
AB  - The activity of three aminoglycosides and six beta-lactam antibiotics on strains  of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci was studied. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs), and the minimal antibiotic concentrations (MACs) were determined after 5 h of incubation in broth cultures by colony-forming-unit counts. The MICs were also determined by agar dilution after 24 h of incubation. The MICs on agar after 24 h of incubation were higher than those in broth after 5 h of incubation. The differences ranged from 1.1- to 14.2-fold, but in most cases were only three- to fivefold (P less than 0.05 to less than 0.001). The MBCs at 5 and 24 h were comparable in 71% of tests. For current practice, the MBC of enterococci can be determined after 5 h of incubation with antibiotics. The aminoglycosides showed MBCs which were closer to the MICs than were those of the beta-lactam antibiotics, which required a higher multiple of the MIC to show a bactericidal effect. The MBCs of oxacillin and cefamandole for S. aureus after 5 h of incubation were greater than 128 times the respective MICs. The MACs ranged from 1/1.5 to 1/7 of the 5-h MICs. The three endpoints, MIC, MBC, and MAC, indicate the antibacterial range of an antibiotic in terms of inhibition of growth and bacterial survival. The data suggest that the antibacterial range of an antibiotic is similar for most strains of a given species and is, to some extent, a characteristic of similar antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - In vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-Pseudomonas cephalosporins.
AB  - Apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of Escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). Apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter diversus. Against Klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. The activity of apalcillin against Enterobacter (E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, and E. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. The activity of apalcillin against Proteus mirabilis was similar to that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive Proteus and Providencia. Only 40% of Serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. Apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. It was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). There was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. Apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.
TI  - The resistance of polyglycolic acid sutures to attack by infected human urine.
AB  - Polyglycolic acid sutures were incubated at 37 degrees C in broth, and in 0.22 mu millipore filtered human urine infected with Escherichia coli, Str. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At 3 days the Proteus had destroyed the polyglycolic acid sutures in the urine but not in the broth. None of the other organisms had any effect on the tensile strength of the suture material. Under the scanning electron microscope the Proteus-destroyed polyglycolic acid sutures showed multiple transverse microfractures. Polyglycolic acid sutures should not be used for closing urothelium in patients with a proven Proteus infection.
TI  - Analysis of the disagreement between automated bioluminescence-based and culture  methods for detecting significant bacteriuria, with proposals for standardizing evaluations of bacteriuria detection methods.
AB  - A fully automated method for detecting significant bacteriuria is described which uses firefly luciferin and luciferase to detect bacterial ATP in urine. The automated method was calibrated and evaluated, using 308 urine specimens, against two reference culture methods. We obtained a specificity of 0.79 and sensitivity of 0.75 using a quantitative pour plate reference test and a specificity of 0.79 and a sensitivity of 0.90 using a semiquantitative standard loop reference test. The majority of specimens negative by the automated test but positive by the pour plate reference test were specimens which grew several bacterial species. We suggest that such disagreement was most likely for urine containing around 10(5) colony-forming units per ml (the culture threshold of positivity) and that these specimens were ones contaminated by urethral or vaginal flora. We propose standard procedures for calibrating and evaluating rapid or automated methods for the detection of significant bacteriuria and have analyzed our results using these procedures. We recommend that identical analyses should be reported for other evaluations of bacteriuria detection methods.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Bacterial infections in a hospital-based skilled nursing facility.
AB  - The incidence of bacterial infections occurring in 132 residents in a Veterans Administration hospital-based nursing home care unit (VA NHCU) was studied retrospectively over a 1 yr period. There were a total of 35 non-Foley-catheter-related bacterial infections documented during this time, occurring in 21 residents. Of these infections, 14 were pulmonary, 18 urinary and 3 of the integument. Of the 23 residents having indwelling urinary catheters, 47.8% became clinically symptomatic due to a urinary infection at least one time during the year. Thirty-six per cent of these infections were due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 48% were due to E. coli and Proteus mirabilis. Eighteen of 23 residents (78.3%) with Foley catheters had more than one predominant organism cultured from their urine during the year, making the practice of monthly cultures not very useful in considering treatment. If one grouped all urinary tract infections on the NHCU, the major pathogens were Pseudomonas (19.5%), Klebsiella (17.1%). Proteus (17.1%) and E. coli (14.6%). Documented pulmonary infections were predominantly due to Streptococcus pneumonia (50.0%) and Hemophilus influenza (35.7%). Our data suggest that the location of the institutional setting must be considered in caring for the elderly resident in a skilled nursing facility. Future plans to establish hospital based nursing home units must consider the benefits resulting from easy access to acute health care and educational programs against problems of hospital bacterial flora.
TI  - Influence of bacterial products on the motility of stallion spermatozoa.
AB  - Sterile filtrates were prepared from equine isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (genitalium), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus equisimilis, Actinobacillus equuli, and Corynebacterium equi and mixed individually with extended stallion semen. When diluted in the extended semen the filtrates represented bacterial populations of 0.5 x 10(6), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells/ml. pH values were recorded for each filtrate. Specimens were monitored for percentage motile spermatozoa at 30-min intervals until they reached 10% or less for 2 consecutive observations. All specimens were maintained at 25 degrees C in a water bath. Ten specimens were examined from each of 5 clinically normal stallions. The major reduction in percentage motile spermatozoa as compared to the control sample occurred before the first observation. From this point the rate of deterioration in motility in the filtrates approximated that of the control. The differences detected between the filtrates and control in percentage motile sperm cells were all statistically significant at P less than 0.01.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of ceftazidime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin potentially active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ceftazidime were evaluated  against 700 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Ceftazidime was less active than penicillins or older cephalosporins against Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis, Listeria, or anaerobic species. Ceftazidime was as active as ceftizoxime and moxalactam and more active than cefoperazone against Escherichia coli. Klebsiella, and Proteus mirabilis with minimal inhibitory concentrations of less than 0.2 mg/liter. Ceftazidime also inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella at concentrations below 0.2 mg/liter. Most Morganella, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus inconstans were inhibited at concentrations below 1 mg/liter, similar to the concentrations for moxalactam, ceftizoxime, and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the most active agent tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean minimal inhibitory concentration of 1.6 mg/liter. It inhibited carbenicillin-, piperacillin-, cefoperazone-, and cefsulodin-resistant Pseudomonas. Minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar, with the exception of some Pseudomonas values at 10(7) colony-forming units. Use of different media did not alter minimal inhibitory concentration values. Ceftazidime was not hydrolyzed by staphylococcal beta-lactamase or plasmid beta-lactamase of the TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, OXA-1, PSE-1, PSE-2 types or by inducible beta-lactamases of the cephalosporinase type. Ceftazidime provides an extremely active agent against aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. When combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of Gram-negative bacilli. Bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, in addition strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. The beta-lactamases produced by Enterobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant to augmentin (1).
TI  - Clinical study of mezlocillin for the treatment and prevention of postoperative obstetric and gynecological infections.
AB  - Twenty-one women were given mezlocillin for the treatment or prevention of infections after obstetric and gynecological surgery. Ten women had active infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Streptococcus faecalis. They had a 90% rate of recovery after an average of seven days of treatment with 6 to 15 gm/day of mezlocillin. The other 11 women were given mezlocillin prophylactically, 2 gm every 12 hours for seven days. All had good postoperative courses without complications caused by infections. Among both groups only three adverse reactions occurred, two instances of rash and one case of moderate diarrhea. All resolved spontaneously without discontinuation of treatment.
TI  - Cefotaxime treatment of skin and skin structure infections: a multicenter study.
AB  - The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cefotaxime, a new parenteral cephalosporin resistant to beta-lactamase, were evaluated in a multicenter open trial. The study population comprised 594 hospitalized patients with infections of the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Of these, 409 patients fulfilled the protocol requirements for assessment of clinical efficacy. Usual dosages of cefotaxime were in the range of 1.5 to 12 gm/day for 5 to 85 days. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent gram-positive organism; Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most frequent gram-negative bacilli; and Peptococcus sp, the most frequent anaerobic organism isolated. Of the 409 evaluable patients, 382 (93.4%) were clinically cured. Bacteriological cures were obtained in 316 of 372 (84.9%) patients. Reactions to cefotaxime included asymptomatic eosinophilia, rash, drug fever, phlebitis, and elevated hepatic enzyme levels. All reactions were transient, and drug therapy had to be terminated in only eight patients. Cefotaxime proved effective for treating a variety of skin and soft tissue infections. The lack of serious toxicity and adverse reactions associated with cefotaxime, together with its broad antimicrobial spectrum, makes it a suitable substitute for aminoglycosides in certain clinical settings.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin in comparison with cefotaxime, lamoxactam, cefoperazone, piperacillin gentamicin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK 0787), a new stable derivative of thienamycin was compared with that of lamoxactam, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, piperacillin and gentamicin against 410 clinical isolates of common bacteria. In comparison with the other agents, MK 0787 was more or equally active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., and Serratia spp. It inhibited all isolates at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l, but was less active than cefotaxime and lamoxactam against Proteus mirabilis and less active than cefotaxime, lamoxactam and cefoperazone against Beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to N-formimidoyl thienamycin than to other antibiotics.
TI  - Minimum bactericidal concentrations in conventional and two other techniques.
AB  
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ampicillin and amoxicillin.
AB  
TI  - Microflora of the intertriginous toe surfaces of patients with athlete's foot.
AB  
TI  - Phage X: a plasmid-dependent, broad host range, filamentous bacterial virus.
AB  - Phage X was isolated from sewage as plating on Escherichia coli or Salmonella typhimurium strains harbouring the incompatibility group X plasmid R6K. It also plated on a strain of Serratia marcescens carrying this plasmid. It failed to form plaques on Proteus mirabilis, P. morganii or Providencia alcalifaciens harbouring R6K, but did multiply on them. No phage increase occurred with homologous R- strains. Phage X also plated or registered an increase in titre on E. coli or S. typhimurium strains carrying various plasmids of incompatibility groups M, N, P-1, U or W as well as the unassigned plasmid R775. It adsorbed to pili determined by a group P-10 plasmid in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain but did not multiply on this organism. The phage was filamentous and curly, resistant to ribonuclease and diethyl ether and sensitive to chloroform. It adsorbed to the tips of pili.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ceftazidime, a beta-lactamase stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ceftazidime were evaluated  against 700 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ceftazidime was less active than penicillins or older cephalosporins against Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and it did not inhibit Streptococcusfaecalis. However, ceftazidime was as active as moxalactam and cefoperazone against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Proteus mirabilis with MICs less than 0.2 mg/l. Ceftazidime also inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Salmonella and Shigella at concentrations below 0.2 mg/l. Most Morganella, Pr. rettgeri, Pr. vulgaris and Pr. inconstans were inhibited at concentrations below 1 mg/l similar to concentrations for moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the most active agent tested against Ps. aeruginosa, with a mean MIC of 1.6 mg/l. It inhibited carbenicillin, piperacillin, cefoperazone, cefsulodin resistant Pseudomonas.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftazidime (GR 20263) against routine hospital isolates and highly resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Ceftazidime was found to be highly active against routine hospital isolates of strains of Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis, with the mean MICs varying between 0.11 and 0.75 mg/l. It had marked activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a mean MIC of 1.8 mg/l which was comparable to tobramycin (11 mg/l) and superior to other aminoglycosides, penicillins and cefotaxime. Although ceftazidime was considerably more active than cefuroxime and cefamandole against E. coli, K. aerogenes and Ent. cloacae, its activity against strains with multi-antibiotic resistance and marked beta-lactamase production was much diminished, with mean MICs between 5 and 21 mg/l. These results with ceftazidime suggest it will be a valuable parenteral compound in the treatment of severe bacterial infections due to strains of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime compared with that of other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was compared with the activities of cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefsulodin, cefuroxime, cephalothin and cefatriaxon against 331 clinical bacterial isolates. Against Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus ceftazidime, with MIC90 of < or = 0.25 mg/l, was more active than cephalothin, cefoperazone and cefuroxime but less active than cefotaxime and ceftriaxone Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter were inhibited at higher concentrations (MIC90 1-4 mg/l). The activity of ceftazidime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MIC90 of 4 mg/l) was four times that of cefoperazone, five times that of cefatriaxon and ten times that of cefotaxime, but similar to that of cefsulodin. Against Staphylococcus aureus and Lancefield groups A and B streptococci ceftazidime was less active than the other cephalosporins. Group D streptococci were resistant. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by < or = 0.25 mg/l. There were no significant inoculum effects on ceftazidime and MBCs were within one twofold dilution of MICs. The addition of 50% human serum had no effect on MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Variation in bacterial count in otorrhea from cases of chronic otitis media depending upon the method of antibiotic administration.
AB  - Patients with chronic otitis media (COM) were divided into two groups, one to be  given Cephalexin (CEX) orally and the other to be given CEX ear drops locally. The counts of viable bacteria in otorrheal samples collected before and after CEX administration were determined. The incidence of decrease in the count of bacteria was higher in the group given ear drops than in the group given oral doses. The magnitude of decrease was greater in the former group. Various concentration of CEX representing the levels of the drug considered available at an otitis focus following oral administration were added to otorrheal preparations placed in biophotometer cells. After 24 hours of incubation, bacteria as undetected initially in the otorrhea were found in the biophotometer cells in 3 of 14 cases of COM.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine gluconate against natural and artificial  contamination during simulation of in-use conditions.
AB  - Commercial bottles containing chlorhexidine gluconate (antimicrobial skin cleanser), whether exposed to room atmosphere or experimentally inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Proteus mirabilis, did not exhibit microbial growth.
TI  - Comparative in vitro study in new cephalosporins.
AB  - Three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and cefotiam, were evaluated  in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities were compared with those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. All three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against Streptococcus ssp. Cefotiam and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against Streptococcus aureus. Ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except Enterobacter spp. Ceftizoxime was active against all, except Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although cefotiam was quite active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp, and P. aeruginosa. The in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Investigation into the microbial flora of healing and non-healing decubitus ulcers.
AB  - Seventy-four pressure lesions in fifty-three geriatric patients were observed at  weekly intervals to determine the bacterial flora and the healing index of each lesion, expressed as initial area of lesion (cm2) - final area of lesion (cm2) divided by time in days. The micro-organisms which caused infection included Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides asaccharolyticus. Many lesions contained a mixed flora. P mirabilis and Ps aeruginosa were associated with necrotic (p less than 0.005) and enlarging (p less than 5 x 10(-7)) lesions. Bacteroides spp were associated with necrotic lesions (p less than 0.05). The presence of S aureus in a lesion was not associated with any particular trend in healing index. The implications of the microbiological findings are discussed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of FR-31564, a phosphonic acid antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activity of FR-31564 [sodium hydrogen 3-(N-hydroxyformamido)propylphosphate] against gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was investigated and compared with that of fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The in vitro activity of FR-31564 was markedly enhanced when combined with glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, but not when combined with ribose phosphate, adenosine monophosphate, or glycerol phosphate. In vitro activity of FR-31564 also was enhanced by human or horse blood, but not by human serum. The type of medium had a great effect on the minimal inhibitory concentration, with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations achieved on nutrient agar, 8- to 16-fold less than with Mueller-Hinton, heart infusion, or Trypticase soy agars. FR-31564 was more active than fosfomycin, cephalexin, carbenicillin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes, and Citrobacter. It was less active than fosfomycin against Serratia marcescens and Proteus mirabilis and did not inhibit gram-positive cocci or anaerobic species. FR-31564 inhibited a number of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and some Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant to the other agents. In the presence and absence of human blood FR-31564 showed bactericidal activity, and P. aeruginosa exposed to FR-31564 for 3 h showed a 6-h lag in regrowth. FR-31564 administered by the subcutaneous route was more active in protecting mice challenged with P. aeruginosa than was fosfomycin, carbenicillin, or cefoperazone. It was as active by the oral route in protecting mice challenged with E. coli as was fosfomycin, ampicillin, cephalexin, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Contamination of chlorhexidine cream used to prevent ascending urinary tract infections.
AB  - Chlorhexidine-containing cream is often used as an antimicrobial barrier to ascending urinary tract infection in patients with indwelling urethral catheters. The cream is dispensed in small tubes for personal use but repeated use of a tube still entails a potential infection hazard. The extent of cream contamination was analysed by emulsifying it in 1% peptone broth with 1% Tween-80 added as a wetting agent, and culturing quantitatively for bacteria and fungi by membrane filtration. Twenty-three per cent of cream samples and 35% of swabs taken from outside the tube beneath the screw cap demonstrated microbial contamination. Isolates included potential pathogens such as enterococci, staphylococci, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, opportunists like Moraxella spp. and diphtheroids, and contaminants such as Bacillus spp., micrococci, and a mould of the genus Cladosporium. Contamination of cream with a particular bacterial strain was found to precede urinary tract infection with the same microbe. We recommend that chlorhexidine cream for this use be dispensed in single dose units to ensure sterility.
TI  - Effect of combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam.
AB  - The effect of cefsulodin in combination with mecillinam was examined against a wide range of bacterial species. The antibacterial spectrum was widened by the combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam in the ratio of 5:1 and 10:1. In overall observations, in the in vitro test, a synergistic effect against clinical isolates was found on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, and an additive effect was found on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus inconstans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In in vivo tests, a synergistic effect was observed on S. marcescens TN 66 and K. pneumoniae DT infections and an additive effect was observed on S. aureus 308 A-1, E. coli O-111 and T-7, C. freundii TN 518, E. cloacae TN 603, P. vulgaris GN 4712, P. morganii Tn 373 and P. aeruginosa U 31 infections.
TI  - Detection of potential biochemical indicators of infection in the burned rat.
AB  - Sever thermal injury is often complicated by infection. Moreover, the injury itself render the early detection of infection more difficult. Rapid early detection of infection would thus aid in the treatment of severely burned patients. PCA filtrates of whole blood from burned-infected rats contain three substances that appear to be early indicators of infection in the thermally injured animal. These factors are only slightly affected by the extent of injury. These factors do not appear to be microorganism-specific in that they are found in rats infected with Proteus mirabilis as well as with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One factor absorbs light at 398 nm and seems to be associated with some cellular component of blood. The other two substances are fluorescent, one gamma ex 280 nm gamma em 340 nm, the other gamma 355 nm gamma em 420 nm, and are detectable in PCA filtrates of plasma as well as of whole blood. All factors are retained by filters with a 25,000 dalton pore size. All factors are precipitable from PCA filtrates by phosphotungstic acid, suggesting that they may be proteins. The 355/420 factor increases with oxidation, whereas both the 280/340 substance and 398 nm material decrease.
TI  - Investigation into the antibacterial activity in vitro of cement-antibiotic mixtures.
AB  - An investigation was made into the antibacterial activity in vitro of CMW cement  and antibiotic mixtures. The results of this study are reported and the risk factors are discussed. On the basis of our studies, the use of this mixture in clinical practice would appear to be premature.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the most commonly used disinfectants on multiresistant nosocomial bacterial strains].
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365 or A-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. Cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the Enterobacteriaceae. The MIC(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for S. aureus. Group D streptococci were less susceptible. Cefmenoxime was very active against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis with MIC(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. Cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., respectively. MICs for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. In addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. The combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the Enterobacteriaceae and 100% of P. aeruginosa strains tested. Development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial MICs but more rapid for those with higher initial MICs. Cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or S. aureus but was less effective against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Cefotaxime CSF levels in children with purulent meningitis (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotaxime concentrations obtained in the C.S.F. of twelve children suffering from bacterial meningitis and undergoing monotherapy with this antibiotic are reported. Among these 12 patients, 4 infants (aged 3 to 28 days) had neonatal meningitis (due to Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli); one infant (2 months old) had meningitis due to Salmonella panama; 5 children (aged 5 to 11 months) had meningitis due to Haemophilus; and 2 children had belated superinfection caused by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefotaxime concentration reached a high level as early as one hour after the injection (3 to 19 mcg/ml), remained at this level until the fifth hour (1,8 to 14,3 mcg/ml) and decreased without significant proportionality with the disappearance of the inflammatory symptoms. Compared to the M.I.C. of the bacteria which caused the twelve cases of meningitis, these results show that the concentrations in the C.S.F. are much higher than the M.I.C.'s. These results are comparable to those of previous studies. Cefotaxime diffuses in the C.S.F. and gives concentrations which ensures an antibacterial activity that ampicillin could not reach: in particular against Haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 13-9904, a new beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Ro 13-9904 against 245 clinical isolates was determined by an agar dilution method. The activity of Ro 13-9904 against most Enterobacteriaceae was similar to that of cefotaxime; it was slightly more active than cefotaxime against Proteus mirabilis, Providencia species, and Serratia marcescens, but slightly less active against Klebsiella species. Ro 13-9904 was twofold more active than cefotaxime and threefold more active than ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with a mean MIC of 7.2 micrograms/ml; isolates highly resistant to ticarcillin were inhibited by a mean MIC of 17.2 micrograms/ml. Ro 13-9904 was fourfold more active than ampicillin against susceptible Haemophilus influenzae and was equally active against beta-lactamase-producing isolates. Ro 13-9904 was highly active against pneumococci and moderately active (MIC, 4 micrograms/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus isolates, whether they were susceptible or resistant to penicillin G. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were completely resistant to Ro 13-9904 (MIC, greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Eosinophilic pustulosis with pemphigus-like antibody.
AB  - A 75-year-old male with eosinophilic pustulosis Ofuji complicated by superinfection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis is described. This is the first case of eosinophilic pustulosis with an antiepidermal antibody. This antibody was directed against the intercellular substance of the lower epidermis and it was detected by direct immunofluorescence in the patient's normal and lesional skin. As revealed by indirect immunofluorescence the patient's serum reacted with intercellular substance of human lower epidermis but not with guinea pig esophagus. Possibly the detected autoantibody is not characteristic for eosinophilic pustulosis Ofuji but rather an accompanying feature of this case similar to the antiepidermal antibodies found in patients with drug reactions and burns.
TI  - A comparison of cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone:  an in vitro test on a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of 9 species and 1 genus of bacteria.
AB  - The sensitivity of a number of beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens to cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefoperazone was determined in vitro. All bacterial cultures were examined for beta-lactamase production using the chromogenic cephalosporin compound 87/312. All strains were typed by means of antibiotic and chemotherapeutic sensitivities. Only non-identical strains were used. A tray method was used to determine the quantity of antimicrobial product necessary for a complete growth inhibition at various culture dilutions. The results showed that all strains of H. influenzae, especially in the dilution 2.10(6), were sensitive to the five cephalosporins. The other species and genus of bacteria had a varying sensitivity to the five cephalosporins. Cefoperazone had potent activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Differences between the five cephalosporins with regard to the effect of culture dilution were only small.
TI  - Preoperative treatment with azlocillin in complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Eighteen patients, aged 18-84 years, with complicated urinary tract infections admitted to hospital were treated preoperatively with azlocillin (Securopen) for 5 to 10 days. Two patients having chronic pyelonephritis were not operated. Isolates bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Escherichia coli (2) and Klebsiella spp. (1). Serum concentrations and urine recovery were measured on the fifth day of treatment. The mean serum half-life was 1.85 h and the mean value of the urine recovery 47% of the single dose. On the 5th day of treatment the urine was sterile in 80% of the patients. In 12 patients (60%) the urine was still sterile when controlled 2-6 months after operation and prophylactic postoperative treatment with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Some observations on the activity of three antiseptics used as bladder irrigants  in the treatment of urinary tract infection in patients with indwelling catheters.
AB  - A comparison has been made of the activity of three antiseptics that are used as  bladder irrigants in the treatment of urinary tract infection in catheterised patients. At the concentrations and exposure times used for bladder irrigation, phenoxyethanol (2:4% v/v) proved to be highly bactericidal against urine-grown cells of all the common urinary pathogens tested. Chlorhexidine (200 microgram/ml) was active against Escherichia coli and produced significant reductions in the viability of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but failed to eradicate Providencia stuartii. Exposure to noxythiolin (2.5% v/v) for 20 min had little effect in any of the bacteria, even though all strains tested had been recorded as noxythiolin-sensitive by conventional plate sensitivity tests. Contact with noxythiolin for periods of at least 1-2 hrs was necessary before extensive bactericidal activity was detected. These results provide an explanation of the poor clinical performance of noxythiolin that we have observed.
TI  - [Studies on the usefulness of different disinfectants for the aerosol disinfection of surfaces (author's transl)].
AB  - In a glove-box made of stainless steel germ-carriers of lime-wood and aluminium were layed out after having been contaminated with different vegetative bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis). Disinfectant aerosols of several germicidal substances belonging to different chemical groups were brought into the glove-box. The aerosol was produced by a commercial generator. The following substances proved to have a good disinfectant effect under the conditions used: hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, formaldehyde, glutardialdehyde, beta-propiolacton, Lysoformin resp. Lysoformin 2000 and Tegodor 73, whereas triethylenglycol, phenol-derivatives (Gevisol, Environ), Chloramine 80 and detergents were not able to kill all the bacteria on the germ-carriers within 2 h. Determination of the natural mortality rate showed, that at relative humidities of over 58% the test bacteria die within 72 h on the germ-carriers without presence of disinfectants. At a relative humidity of 77%, Staphylococcus aureus on wooden germ-carriers died within 24 h.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of purified cobra venom factor, isolated from the venom of  Naja naja atra, on the in vivo immune response in Galleria mellonella.
AB  
TI  - Postantibiotic suppression of bacterial growth.
AB  - Persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. The persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. Although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. With gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. With gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. Inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The duration of the postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration of exposure up to a point of maximal response. Persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.
TI  - Comparison of mezlocillin and carbenicillin as therapy for various infectious diseases.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of mezlocillin, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin, were compared with those of carbenicillin in a nonblind, controlled clinical study in 89 adult patients. The infections treated were primarily those of the urinary tract, skin, and gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary tract. Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the causative organisms isolated most frequently. A complete resolution of signs and symptoms was achieved in 78% of the mezlocillin patients and in 71% of the carbenicillin patients. In the mezlocillin group, causative organisms were eliminated in 80% of the courses, and in the carbenicillin group the elimination rate was 86%. Two adverse reactions, rash and diarrhea, were reported in mezlocillin-treated patients; none were reported for the carbenicillin group.
TI  - In vitro comparison of three new cephalosporins: LY-127935, cefotaxime and cefoperazone.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of three new cephalosporin antibiotics Ly-127935 (LY), cefotaxime (CTX) and cefoperazone (CFP) was examined. LY, CTX and CFP had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis while CFP was less inhibitory than LY or CTX against Klebsiella spp.; indole + Proteus and gentamicin (GM)-susceptible Serratia. LY and CTX were effective while CFP was inactive against Enterobacter spp. and GM-resistant Serratia. CFP was more active than LY or CTX against GM-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa but was the least active agent against GM-resistant isolates. Bacteroides fragilis were more susceptible to LY than CTX or CFP. Combination studies against P. aeruginosa with cephalosporin-GM pairs demonstrated synergy.
TI  - In vitro antagonism by erythromycin of the bactericidal action of antimicrobial agents against common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested in vitro against erythromycin combined with ampicillin, cefamandole, or gentamicin. Antagonism by erythromycin occurred with 47% of the combinations involving strains of S. aureus and to a lesser degree with H. influenzae. Synergy occurred most commonly with H. influenzae (27%). The high frequency of antagonism and synergy with these organisms was associated with a broad range of bacteriostatic action by erythromycin against these same bacteria. The implications for the treatment of pneumonia are discussed.
TI  - Ro 13-9904, a long-acting broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Ro 13-9904, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was found to have high in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae and other gram-negative bacteria, including various isolates resistant to cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefazolin. It showed promising activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although inhibitory against Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations readily achievable in plasma, it was less potent against this pathogen than cefamandole, cefazolin, or cefuroxime. Isolates of Streptococcus faecalis were uniformly resistant to all the cephalosporins tested. Ro 13-9904 was more active than cefotaxime against Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae, but less active against S. aureus. Ro 13-9904 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases. Its therapeutic efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice was equal to or slightly superior to that of cefotaxime and SCE-1365 when the antibiotics were administered in repeated subcutaneous doses after bacterial challenge. Cefoperazone, and particularly cefamandole nafate, cefazolin, and mezlocillin were less effective. Although structurally related to cefotaxime and SCE-1365, Ro 13-9904 was found to differ from them in one important respect, namely, in having a long duration of action; this was observed with single-dose treatment given before bacterial challenge. Its broad spectrum of activity coupled with favorable pharmacokinetic properties make Ro 13-9904 a promising compound for clinical studies.

TI  - Topical antimicrobial cream sensitivity testing.
AB  - These gratifying results have made topical antimicrobial sensitivity testing an integral part of bacteriologic monitoring of the burn wound. Presently, we use the needle extrusion test routinely on all burn patients at our center. Its selection over the other antimicrobial tests is based on technical considerations. The needle extrusion test can be completed by an experienced technician within five minutes, but the disk diffusion test and agar-well diffusion test take two and five times longer, respectively. This time saving is an important consideration when the microflora of ten or more burn patient at our center are being monitored by this test every other day. This test system may prove useful for the topical antibiotic selection for the treatment of other wounds beside the burn wound. Its potential value in these other conditions must await the results of carefully controlled clinical studies.
TI  - The effect of local infection upon wound healing: an experimental study.
AB  - Local infection was introduced into rat abdominal wounds using a 10(8) bacterial/ml inoculum. Three groups of infection were used: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a combination group of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Infection was shown to delay healing as judged by bursting tests. Fibroblast proliferation was depressed at the wound edges but there was an increase in the total amount of hydroxyproline present. Small vessel angiogenesis was increased in areas of abscess formation but larger vessels were commonly blocked by thrombus or distorted by surrounding inflamed tissue. The possible causes of these effects are discussed.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A, a derivative of fortimicin A.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of O-demethylfortimicin A (ODMF), a derivative of fortimicin A, was compared with those of fortimicin A and gentamicin against a spectrum of 256 organisms. All three antibiotics were active in low concentrations against all strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter sp., and Staphylococcus aureus, with ODMF most active against Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, and Providencia and gentamicin most active against other species. Activity of each of the antibiotics against group D streptococci was poor. The overall activity of ODMF was superior to that of fortimicin A for all groups of organisms examined and was most pronounced, approximately three-fold, against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both ODMF and fortimicin A were resistant to the action of several aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, with the exception of 3-N-acetyltransferase-I. ODMF and fortimicin A showed similar rapid bactericidal effects at multiples of the minimum inhibitory concentration and equivalent synergistic activity against enterococci when combined with penicillin G. The combination of carbenicillin with ODMF, fortimicin A, or gentamicin was synergistic for approximately 80% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested. Inactivation of ODMF and fortimicin A when combined with carbenicillin in vitro was minimal or absent, whereas gentamicin was substantially inactivated under similar conditions. ODMF, fortimicin A, and gentamicin exhibited protective activity in mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, S. aureus, or P. aeruginosa. Gentamicin was the most active, followed by ODMF and fortimicin A. The superior in vitro activity of ODMF compared with fortimicin A against P. aeruginosa was confirmed in vivo.
TI  - Naturally occurring plasmids exhibiting incompatibility with members of incompatibility groups I and P.
AB  - From a group of naturally occurring antibiotic resistance plasmids, a number of plasmids were identified which were incompatible with members of incompatibility group P and also incompatibility group I alpha or I gamma. These plasmids also exhibited strong entry exclusion with members of group P only and showed a host range which resembled that of plasmids of group I rather than those of group P. Segregants of a number of these plasmids appeared to have lost some of the incompatability and/or surface exclusion functions. Studies of nucleic acid homology indicated that these plasmids were very similar to one another. They exhibited 15 to 20% nucleic acid homology with representatives of the I alpha and I gamma groups, yet showed less than 2% homology with the group P plasmid RP4.
TI  - In vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
AB  - N-Formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin G, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. All of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. More than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of Staphylococcus aureus and 80% of S. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by N-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. Only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. It inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. All 16 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. The marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Expression of E. coli genes carried by hybrids of plasmid RP4.
AB  - Hybrids of the RP4 plasmid, containing bacteriophage Mu and chromosomal genes of  Escherichia coli, were transferred into Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The individual genes of the arginine, histidine, leucine and threonine operons were expressed in these microorganisms.
TI  - [The dispersal of pathogens from infected patients shown by environmental culturing (author's transl)].
AB  - During a two year's period environmental culturing was done to control hygienic measures, for pedagogical reasons or to trace a source of infection in a large university hospital. Phage typing of Staphylococcus aureus, pyocine typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and resistograms and biotypes of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter were used to compare patient strains with environmental isolates. It could be shown that the infecting organisms can be cultured not only from the site of infection where samples for bacteriological diagnosis usually are taken. But numerous sites of the patients' environment proved to be contaminated with pathogens indistinguishable from the infecting strains. These sites were for example: the patient's hands and other parts of his healthy skin, the outside of wound dressing, bed linen, clothes, floors and nursing utensils. The results convincingly provided reasons for environmental decontamination and for the institution of barrier nursing techniques.
TI  - Experimental infection in rabbits evoked by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae treated with gentamicin, amikacin and sisomicin.
AB  - Rabbits were infected with freshly isolated strains of Ps. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, E. coli or K. pneumoniae and treated with gentamicin, amikacin or sisomicin in a controlled study. Therapeutic results were evaluated by survival of animals and viable counts of etiologic bacteria in several tissues after sacrification of treated animals at the same time. Sisomicin was the drug of choice for Ps. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis infections, when compared with amikacin and gentamicin. Its action is practically equal to that of amikacin in K. pneumoniae infection. Sisomicin appeared less active in E. coli infections than amikacin, but was superior to gentamicin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of miloxacin.
AB  - The chemotherapeutic properties of miloxacin (5,8-dihydro-5-methoxy-8-oxo-2H-1,3-dioxolo-[4,5-g]quinoline-7-carboxylic acid) have been compared with those of oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. The in vitro activities of miloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentrations) against a variety of gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus, were comparable to those of oxolinic acid and 8 to 16 times greater than those of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was more active than oxolinic acid against some anaerobes and less active against staphylococci. Miloxacin exhibited significant activities when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or Serratia marcescens. Its efficacy was comparable to that of oxolinic acid and two to four times greater than that of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was less active against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and inactive at the maximum test doses against a Streptococcus pyogenes infection.

TI  - Expression of the lactose transposon Tn951 in Escherichia coli, Proteus and Pseudomonas.
AB  - The control of beta-galactosidase specified by the lactose transposon Tn951 (inserted into RP1 to give pGC9114) has been studied in Escherichia coli K12, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida; in the first two species comparison could be made with Flac. In E. coli K12, the Tn951 and chromosomally encoded enzymes showed marked qualitative differences in regulatio, the former giving a substantially lower maximum induced level and induction ratio. Several parameters were slightly affected by strain background. In P. mirabilis, beta-galactosidase control determined by both Flac (in accord with earlier work) and pGC9114 was markedly different from E. coli in that maximal induced levels were about an order of magnitude lower and the induction ratio was reduced to 3 to 5. In Ps. aeruginosa and Ps. putida, Tn951-specified lac expression was qualitatively similar to that in P. mirabilis. Possible reasons for anomalous expression in Proteus and Pseudomonas are discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftizoxime, a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftizoxime was compared with that of other beta-lactam  antibiotics against 538 isolates. Ceftizoxime was the most active agent tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, inhibiting 80% at 0.025 microgram/ml. It was more active than cefotaxime against Enterobacter cloacae and E. aerogenes. Ceftizoxime was more active than cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, and carbenicillin against Proteus mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus. It inhibited 97% of multiresistant Serratia isolates at 12.5 microgram/ml, whereas cefotaxime inhibited only 19%. Ceftizoxime was less active than cefotaxime and cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was more active than carbenicillin. It was more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against Bacteroides. It was not appreciably destroyed by beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, or Pseudomonas.
TI  - Effect of contamination levels on antimicrobial susceptibilities tested by Autobac I.
AB  - Two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. The pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to Autobac I (Pfizer Inc.) instructions. Various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form 16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. In the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. Of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. These results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.
TI  - UK31214, a new aminoglycoside and derivative of kanamycin B.
AB  - The in vitro activity of UK31214, a kanamycin B derivative, was studied against 250 recent isolates and compared with other aminoglycosides. Against the Enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of Proteus mirabilis and Providencia stuartii) UK31214 and amikacin had similar degrees of activity (mode minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], 1 microgram/ml). Proteus mirabilis and P. stuartii strains were four- to eight-fold more susceptible to amikacin than to UK31214. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were equally susceptible to both amikacin and UK31214 (mode MIC, 4 microgram/ml), but tobramycin was the most active antimicrobial agent tested (mode MIC, 0.25 microgram/ml). The gentamicin-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were equally susceptible to UK31214 and amikacin. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus were more susceptible to gentamicin or tobramycin than to UK31214 or amikacin (mode MIC, 0.5 microgram/ml). A synergistic interaction between UK31214 and carbenicillin was demonstrated.
TI  - Malignant external otitis in infants.
AB  - The authors report two cases of malignant external otitis in infant boys, 5 and 6 months old respectively, caused by different etiologic agents (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis). Both of them were in very poor general health, but neither developed complications such as facial paralysis because of the intensive treatment that was employed from the beginning.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of netilmicin in comparison with gentamicin, sisomicin, tobramycin, and amikacin and their resistance patterns.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of netilmicin, gentamicin, sisomicin, tobramycin and amikacin was determined by means of the microdilution test. 1000 fresh isolates of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 7 species of the Enterobacteriaceae were tested. The activities were compared and cross-resistances were analyzed which appeared among the various drugs. Against amikacin, only 0.5% of all strains (3 P. aeruginosa, 1 S. aureus, 1 P. mirabilis) were resistant. Of the other drugs, netilmicin was the most active drug against S. aureus, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli. Against E. coli, too, sisomicin showed its best activity, and further against Citrobacter spp., Proteus spp. and P. aeruginosa. A total of 12% of all pathogens was gentamicin-resistant. With one exception, these pathogens showed cross-resistance to at least one of the other drugs. In 39% of the cases a cross-resistance between gentamicin and tobramycin was noted, in 26% a gentamicin-tobramycin-sisomicin cross-resistance, in 17% gentamicin-tobramycin-sisomicin-netilmicin cross-resistance, in 11% a gentamicin-sisomicin-netilmicin cross-resistance. A complete cross-resistance was observed between gentamicin and sisomicin with S. aureus, Serratia spp. and Proteus mirabilis, between gentamicin and tobramycin with E. coli, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Naturally occurring plasmids in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: a P class R factor of restricted host range.
AB  - A naturally occurring transmissible plasmid, designated pAV1, has been isolated in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. It specifies resistance to sulphonamides and is capable of mobilizing two non-transmissible resistance determinants for tetracycline and neomycin, respectively, within strains of A. calcoaceticus. It is incompatible with the P class R factors RP4 and R751 in A. calcoaceticus. On this basis we conclude that pAV1 is a member of the P incompatibility group. However, unlike most other P group R factors, pAV1 is not transmissible to strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella or Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - In vitro-activity of clavulanic acid and amoxicillin combined against amoxicillin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The ability of clavulanic acid to inactivate beta-lactamase was investigated using 47 amoxicillin-resistant bacteria. In the presence of 10 mg/l clavulanic acid most strains of staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Proteus mirabilis became fully amoxicillin-sensitive. This effect of clavulanic acid was in most instances not observed with Serratia marcescens, Proteus inconstans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species.
TI  - [Detection of ureolytic bacteria in the urine of stone patients (author's transl)].
AB  - Using a very sensitive and selective indicator medium we tested the urine of 308  stone patients for ureolytic bacteria. Urease-producing bacteria were found in 41 patients. In the urine of 13 of these patients we found more than 10(4) bacteria/ml and in 28 patients 10(4) or less. 75% of the patients with a positive urease test had infection stones. We believe that the test for urease is a convenient and necessary completion of the bacteriologic-diagnostic measures.
TI  - Comparative studies on the regulation of tryptophan synthesis.
AB  - In vitro DNA recombination techniques have revolutionized the study of genetic control of biosynthetic pathways. Using examples drawn from the pathway of tryptophan synthesis, approaches to the deciphering of regulatory signals and response mechanisms through transposition of DNA segments and DNA sequence analysis will be presented. After reviewing the known chromosomal arrangements and regulatory patterns of trp genes in the bacterial groups studied so far, and describing the results of transferring all or part of the pathway's genes from one organism to a distantly related one, the use of this technique to analyze new organisms will be described. Along with some advantages over the conventional methods there are some pitfalls. Finally, since it is likely that events analogous to recombinant DNA experiments take place readily in nature, their consequences in studies of bacterial evolution will be conjectured.
TI  - [Fosfomycin, a new antibiotic: in vitro activity compared with mezlocillin, cefuroxime and gentamicin].
AB  - In vitro investigations with fosfomycin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and gentamicin  against staphylococci, enterobacteriaceae an pseudomonadaceae were carried out by Agar Dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar. The fosfomycin breakpoint for the low dosage of 2-3 times 3 g per infusion daily was defined with 16 micro g/ml and for the high dosage of 2-3 times 5 g fosfomycin per infusion with 64 micro g/ml. At a concentration of 16 micro g/l fosfomycin more than 90% of the cultures of staph. aureus (penicillin-resistant), e. coli, proteus mirabilis an proteus vulgaris examined were inhibited. At a concentration of less than 64 micro g/ml fosfomycin 80 toi 100% of the cultures of serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus morgani et rettgeri and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gentamicin sensitive and resistant) were inhibited. Fosfomycin showed an absolute stability against many Beta-Lactamases of different bacterial species.
TI  - Comparison of mezlocillin, piperacillin, Bay k 4999 with carbenicillin and ticarcillin against enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of five penicillins (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and Bay k 4999) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole positive Proteus sp. and Enterobacter species was determined by an agar dilution method. Bay k 4999 and piperacillin were found to be the most active of the semi-synthetic penicillins tested against P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Bay k 4999 was slightly more active than piperacillin against E. coli, about as active as piperacillin against Pseudomonas, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and indole positive Proteus, but more active than piperacillin against Enterobacter species.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of moxalactam, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. Mueller-Hinton agar was used as growth medium. The results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. All isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. The concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml respectively. Moxalactam was highly inhibitory against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. Moxalactam was highly superior against Proteus rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant to cefamandole: the MIC100 and MIC90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. High sensitivity was found in strains of Salmonella species, nine of which were Salmonella typhi: the MIC90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. The broad-spectrum activity and unusual MIC patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of HR-756, cefoxitin and cefuroxine against multiply antibiotic-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of HR-756 compared to cefoxitin and cefuroxime. 122 multiresistant clinical isolates including Enterobacteriaceae (104) and P. aeruginosa (18), which present particular problems in antibiotic chemotherapy, were selected for study. HR-756 inhibited all the stains of S. marcescens, P. mirabilis and indole-positive Proteus spp. at a concentration of 1,3 and 12 micrograms/ml, respectively; beta-lactamase-producing strains were also susceptible. 90% of K. pneumoniae and more than half of the Enterobacter and P. aeruginosa were inhibited from the drug at a concentration 16 microgram/ml. Cefoxitin and cefuroxime were less active than HR-756. Cefoxitin was more effective against S. marcescens and P. mirabilis while the same was the case with cefuroxime against K. pneumoniae strains. The greater efficiency of HR-756 over cefoxitin and cefuroxime against these multiply resistant isolates seems to be due not only to its indifference to the beta-lactamases but also to its easier penetrability into the bacterial cell.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935, a new 1-oxa cephalosporin, against aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A total of 434 clinical aerobic gram-negative bacillary isolates were tested against LY127935, a new 1-oxa cephalosporin, and compared with other cephalosporins, penicillins, and aminoglycosides by a broth microdilution technique. Cefotaxime (HR756), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, and LY127935 were more active, and showed lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (ranges, less than or equal to 0.12 to 2.0 micrograms/ml), than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cefazolin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, Providencia spp., and Citrobacter spp. Against P. aeruginosa, pepercillin, azlocillin, and mezlocillin were the most active beta-lactam agents; 64 micrograms/ml inhibited 99, 93, and 87% of the isolates, respectively. LY127935 and cefotaxime at 16 micrograms/ml inhibited 71% of Pseudomonas isolates, whereas the aminoglycosides gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml inhibited 84, 88, and 93%, respectively. Minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined for all isolates and were generally the same as the minimum inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Comparison of antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin, ceftizoxime (FK 749) with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - FK 749 is a distinctive new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic with a broad antibacterial spectrum which is more potently active against a wide variety of Gram-negative bacilli, including the opportunistic pathogens such as Citrobacter and Enterobacter species and Serratia marcescens, than SCE 963, T 1551 and cefmetazole. The activity of FK 749 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, pyogenes was by far superior to that of the three other antibiotics. These test organisms were not resistant to FK 749. The antibacterial activity of FK 749 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was almost the same as that of ticarcillin but was inferior to that of gentamicin and T 1551. The bactericidal activity of FK 749 against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis was more potent than that of the three other antibiotics. FK 749, like cefmetazole, was extremely stable to beta-lactamases. In studies in mice, the therapeutic effect of subcutaneous injection of FK 749 against various infections due to Gram-negative bacilli was by far superior to that of SCE 963, T 1551 and cefmetazole, was almost the same as that of SCE 963 and cefmetazole against Staphylococcus aureus infection and that of ticarcillin against P. aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Synthesis of a selective agar medium for Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - A new agar medium for isolation of Yersinia enterocolitica was formulated based on growth studies which defined an optimum basal, and the evaluation of selective chemical agents, dyes, and antibiotics. The final formulation, designated cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin(CIN) agar, provided quantitative recovery of 40 different strains of Y. enterocolitica in 24 h using incubation at 32 degrees C or with 48 h of incubation at 22 degrees C. The medium was highly selective, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Colony morphology coupled with a differential reaction resulting from mannitol fermentation permitted discrimination of Y. enterocolitica from most of those Gram-negative bacteria that were able to grow on the medium. Recovery and selective characteristics of CIN agar were stable during storage at room temperature for 9 days. CIN agar gave a higher recovery of Y. enterocolitica from feces both direct and with cold enrichment (0.4/1.5%) than Salmonella-Shigella (0.0/0.7%) and MacConkey (0.0/0.9%) agars while significantly reducing the level of background organisms.
TI  - Lethal effect of complement and lysozyme on polymyxin-treated, serum-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - When genetically serum-resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Citrobacter freundii, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Proteus mirabilis, were exposed to polymyxin B, they became susceptible to the bactericidal action of normal human and rabbit sera. In constrast, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics did not render any serum-resistant bacteria serum-sensitive. Synergy between polymyxin B and the serum bactericidal system could be demonstrated by the addition of polymyxin B to bacteria in vitro, as well as to bacilli in serum from rabbits injected with the antibiotic. Polymyxin B-treated bacteria were killed by normal, lysozyme-depleted, C2-deficient, and hypogammaglobulinemic sera, but not by heated or C6-deficient sera. These findings indicate that polymyxin B-treated bacteria can be killed via the alternative complement pathway. However, C3 and C3b were detected on the surface of serum-resistant E. coli, regardless of whether the bacteria had been treated with polymyxin B. This observation suggests that a change in susceptibility to the alternative complement pathway was not the only explanation for the acquired serum sensitivity. Polymyxin B may also affect a step in the complement sequence beyond the activation of C3, a step that is apparently blocked in serum-resistant gram-negative bacteria.

TI  - [Effect of combination of hetacillin, cephapirin and amikacin (author's transl)].
AB  - With the investigations of the effect of combination of hetacillin, cephapirin and amikacin, following experimental results were obtained; 1. Effect of combination of amikacin, cephapirin and hetacillin was differed depending upon the genus and species of bacteria. However, in general, in the cases showing effective results there was a relation in the concentration of these antibiotics. With strains of Escherichia coli amikacin and cephapirin was cooperative, but not with other combinations and strains of Proteus showed similar tendencies to those strains. In the strains of Pseudomonas, no effect was observed with these antibiotics. However, significant cooperative effect was shown in strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. In penicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococci cooperative effect was represented only a combination of amikacin and hetacillin. 2. Amikacin was resistant against penicillinase isolated from penicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus and cephalosporinase extracted from cephalosporin-resistant strain of Escherichia coli. 3. When a strain of K. pneumoniae, showing cooperative effect with amikacin and cephapirin, was examined by electronmicroscopy, enlargement of cells and destruction of the cell walls were observed.

TI  - [Antibacterial in-vitro activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid (author's transl)].
AB  - The in-vitro activity of nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid was investigated in a  combined study in 450 freshly isolated bacterial strains using the agar dilution test. Gram-positive cocci were resistant to both substances except for a few pipemidic acid sensitive staphylococci. Both substances had good antibacterial activity in the gram-negative spectrum. However, the MIC values of pipemidic acid were generally clearly lower than those of nalidixic acid. Only pipemidic acid showed activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus the in-vitro results showed that pipemidic acid has clear-cut and valuable advantages for the treatment of urinary tract infections when compared with nalidixic acid.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance in Christchurch hospitals.
AB  - Prior to June 1976, the isolation of gentamicin resistant organisms was an infrequent occurrence in North Canterbury Hospital Board institutions. During July 1976, 20 different gentamicin resistant organisms were isolated from patients in Christchurch Hospital. Gentamicin resistant organisms hav e been continually isolated from an increasingly wide area since then. The organisms involved are: providence species; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Klebsiella species; E coli; Staphyloccus aureus; Proteus mirabilis; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Acinetobacter species; Enterobacter species; Haemophilus influenzae; Pseudomonas maltophilia CDC II F; Citrobacter species; Alcaligenes odorans and Pseudomonas species. The spread of gentamicin resistant organisms has occurred rapidly in the hospital environment. The importance of the urinary tract as a reservoir of microorganisms is indicated in this report.
TI  - Storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  - Microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. Microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. Studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20C and at -70C of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella as test organisms. The stability at -20C and -70C of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using Staphylococcus eureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and alpha Streptococcus as the test organisms. No significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70C, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. No significant differences were noted at -20C for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. By ten weeks' storage at -20C, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.
TI  - Epidemic occurrence of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - In case-control studies of three epidemics of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis  (NEC) in three different high-risk nurseries in three states, no particular risk factor was associated with affected infants or their mothers. Epidemic cases had higher birth weights and Apgar scores and fewer perinatal difficulties than those previously reported for sporadic cases. Seven infants fed primarily breast milk were not protected against disease. Early antibiotic therapy was associated with a significantly decreased risk of disease in one outbreak. In two hospitals, affected infants who received antibiotic therapy during the first three days of life had a significantly later disease onset. The occurrence of the disease in epidemics and the decreased risk or modification of disease with antibiotic therapy support an infectious etiology for NEC.
TI  - [Frequency and antibiotic resistance of bacteria isolated from urine cultures].
AB  - The AA report the data pertinent to the urine culture performed during a year in  the Sanitary and Prophylactic Laboratory of the district of L'Aquila. In urine samples with number of bacteria > 10(5)/ml have been found E. coli (49%), Proteus mirabilis (32%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Proteus rettgeri (1%), Enterococco (1%). The data are also reported concerning germ resistance to several antibiotics.
TI  - Relative efficacy of carbenicillin indanyl sodium and of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in urinary-tract infections.
AB  - In a 10-day study, carbenicillin indanyl sodium cured urinary-tract infections in 22 of 30 patients (ages, 24-91). In 3 of the remaining patients the treatment was a failure; in 3 others the drug had to be discontinued because of diarrhea and vomiting; and in 2 instances it induced overgrowth of Candida albicans in the urine. Carbenicillin was lethal to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in all 9 cases, to Proteus mirabilis in all 6 cases, and to enterococcus in all 3 cases. A trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination cured urinary-tract infections in 18 of 30 other patients (ages, 28-91), but failed in 3. In 3 patients it gave rise to a skin rash; in 2 to elevation of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels; in 1 to neutropenia; and in 1 to overgrowth of Candida albicans in the urine. Reinfection occurred in 2 patients. Carbenicillin indanyl sodium was more effective than the sulfonamide/trimethoprim combination.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).
TI  - Urinary beta 2 microglobulin in upper and lower urinary-tract infections.
AB  - Beta 2-- microglobulin excretion in 24 h urine collections and beta2- microglobulin clearance were significantly increased in patients with upper-urinary-tract infections, but beta 2- microglobulin clearance and excretion were normal in patients with cystitis. Beta 2-microglobulin estimation may be used to distinguish between upper and lower urinary-tract infections, except when pre-existing tubular damage is present. Voided urine must have a pH above 6 . 0, since beta 2- microglobulin is rapidly degraded in the bladder at low pH.

TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of azlocillin, ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. Piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. Ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. The rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella spp. Increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. The effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. The isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, and enterococci. However, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for P. aeruginosa and enterococci.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin compared with that of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefamandole against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Piperacillin (T-1220), a semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was more active than either carbenicillin or ticarcillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; over 60% of isolates were inhibited at a concentration of 6.3 mug/ml. Piperacillin was bactericidal for 84% of Pseudomonas strains at 100 mug/ml, carbenicillin killed 60%, and ticarcillin killed 68% at that concentration. Piperacillin was also more active than the other penicillins against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, and Proteus mirabilis. The combination of piperacillin and tobramycin, demonstrating synergistic inhibition of 87% of strains of P. aeruginosa, was the most active of the penicillin-aminoglycoside combinations tested for synergism.
TI  - HR 756, a new cephalosporin active against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of HR 756, 7-[2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2-(Z)-(methoximino)acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, was investigated against 659 isolates. HR 756 inhibited Neisseria and Haemophilus species at concentrations similar to those needed with ampicillin. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing N. gonorrhoeae and H. influenzae. HR 756 was the most active compound tested against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, Enterobacter, and Shigella at concentrations of less than 0.1 mug/ml. It was twice as active as carbenicillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and inhibited Bacteroides fragilis as well as cefoxitin. HR 756 killed E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and P. aeruginosa at rates similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Defective cellular immunity to gram-negative bacteria in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - In vitro lymphocyte responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found to be impaired in cystic fibrosis patients with advanced clinical disease. The responses to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis were studied in a similar group of cystic fibrosis patients and normal individuals. Cystic fibrosis patients found to be unresponsive to pseudomonas were also unresponsive to klebsiella, serratia, and proteus. Responsiveness to Staphylococcus aureus was not impaired in cystic fibrosis patients. We postulate that in vitro lymphocyte responses to several gram-negative bacteria require the function of a lymphocyte subpopulation which may be impaired in some cystic fibrosis patients.
TI  - [The role of enteric bacteria in childhood urinary tract infections and their in  vitro response to antimicrobial agents].
AB  - In this study, 154 cases of suspected bacterial urinary tract infection were examined bacteriologically. Urine cultures yielded, E. coli in 84 patients Citrobacter in 22 (C. freundii: 9, C. diversus: 9) Proteus in 21 (P. vulgaris: 6, P. morgani: 4, P. rettgeri: 2. P. mirabilis: 4, lactose fermenting strains: 5), Pseudomonas in 12 (P. aeruginosa: 5, other strains of Pseudomonas: 7), Klebsiella in 9 (K. aerogenes: 3, K. pneumonia: 6) and Enterobacter in 6 patients (E. aerogenes: 1, E. cloacae: 5). In vitro antibiotic sensitivity tests showed that gentamicin, nalidixic acid, bactrim and gantrisin were the most effective antibacterial agents respectively. Multiple resistances was found in 39 strains of E. coli out of 84. In other species multiple resistance was found in varying degrees. It is concluded that. Every measure should be taken to eradicate the causative organisms in the urinary tract in children.
TI  - Treatment with azlocillin in complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - 20 patients, aged 18-84 years, with complicated urinary tract infections admitted to hospital were treated with 6-[(R)-2-(2-oxo-imidazolidine-1-carboxamido)-2-phenyl-acetamido]-penicillanic acid sodium salt (azlocillin, Securopen) for 5 to 10 days. Isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Escherichia coli (2) and Klebsiella spp. (1). Serum concentrations and urine recovery were measured on the fifth day of treatment. The mean serum half-life was 1.85 h and the mean value of the urine recovery 47% of the single dose. Tissue concentrations were analyzed in one patient. The samples were taken 3 h after the infusion. The azlocillin concentration of the renal cortex, 60 microgram/g, was six times higher than the corresponding serum concentration. On the 5th day of treatment the urine was sterile in 80% of the patients. In 12 patients (60%) the urine was still sterile when controlled 2-6 months later. Three patients were treated twice and bacteriologically cured after each period. No sign of sensitization was seen. Side-effects were not reported.
TI  - [Pediatric pharmacology of azlocilin (author's transl)].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic investigations of acylureido-penicillins azlocillin in newborns,  infants and school shildren showed age dependend results. The differences were especially evident in a prolongation of the serum half-life to 2,56 hours in newborns compared to 0.94 hours in school children. On the basis of our pharmacokinetic results and of the dosages resulting from the data the antibiotic was used clinically in twenty eight patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and one patient with a Proteus mirabilis infection. The results were much better in infections of the urinary tract than in infections of the respiratory tract. This might be due to an observe bacterial presistence in spite of highly effective levels of azlocillin in bronchial secretion. The tolerance to the antibiotic was good.
TI  - [Bacteriological in vitro investigations with cefaclor. Correlation of inhibition zone diameter and minimal inhibitory concentration (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparison of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of cefaclor and cephalexin shows that cefaclor is noticeably superior against Citrobacter. Enterobacter and Proteus mirabilis. Only slight differences are seen against other enterobacteria and Staphylococcus aureus. Both cefaclor and cephalexin are completely ineffective against enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Regression analysis to correlate the inhibition zone diameter and MIC of cefaclor produced a very good correlation (r = -0.9741). Using 30 mcg discs on DST agar, inhibition zones of more than 20 mm are to be interpreted as "sensitivity" and zones of less than 13 mm as "resistance".
TI  - In vitro investigations with fosfomycin on Mueller-Hinton agar with and without glucose-6-phosphate.
AB  - Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration of fosfomycin in the agar dilution test on Mueller-Hinton agar showed that the addition of glucose-6-phosphate to the nutrient medium potentiates the action of fosfomycin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Staphylococcus aureus, sometimes by as much as 256-fold. Such a potentiation of action was not detectable with Serratia marcescens, the individual Proteus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococci. Fosfomycin is very effective against most medically important bacterial species on Mueller-Hinton agar containing 25 micrograms/ml glucose-6-phosphate. Over 90% of the cultures of E. coli, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, S. marcescens,Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and enterococci examined were inhibited by less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml fosfomycin.
TI  - Comparative activities of ampicillin, epicillin and amoxycillin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of three aminopenicillins ampicillin, epicillin and  amoxycillin were compared in vitro and in vivo. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the three penicillins were very similar and the compounds were active against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Streptococci including Streptococcus faecalis, and non-beta-lactamase-producing staphylococci were also sensitive to the compounds but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus species were resistant. At concentrations close to MIC value epicillin and ampicillin showed similar bactericidal activity against E. coli and against S. typhi and both compounds caused a slower rate of kill than was seen with amoxycillin. Microscopical observation of the cells exposed to ampicillin and epicillin for 1 h showed the presence of filamentous forms which lysed slowly, whereas cells exposed to amoxycillin for the same period rapidly. Epicillin was similar to or slightly less active than ampicillin against experimental mouse infections, and against the majority of infections both compounds were significantly less effective than amoxycillin by the oral and subcutaneous routes of administration.
TI  - [The antibacterial efficacy of cefaclor in routine testing of clinical material from two Berlin hospitals (author's transl)].
AB  - The agar diffusion method was used to test the antibacterial efficacy of cefaclor against bacterial strains isolated routinely from patients in two hospitals in Berlin. A comparison was made with the efficacy of oxacillin, azlocillin, amikacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, penicillin, cefazolin, nalidixic acid and nitrofurantoin. A total of 1235 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus species, Citrobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Cefaclor was superior to the other substances in its activity against E. coli, Klebsiellae, and Proteus mirabilis. Co-trimoxazole and tetracycline, on the other hand, proved more effective against indole-positive Proteus species and Citrobacter. Tetracycline was also more effective against Enterobacter. Ampicillin was the most effective agent against enterococci, and oxacillin the most effective against S. aureus. Cefaclor showed good antibacterial activity against strains which were resistant to the orally administrable agents ampicillin, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole.

The action of each of the preparations is compared with that of important antibiotics of other substance classes from the group of penicillins and cephalosporins.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in various medical services.
AB  - The analysis of differences in occurrence of antibiotic-resistant strains belonging to ten species of "problem" bacteria was performed by means of a computer program in more than 150,000 bacterial strains isolated in Slovakia in 1977. In all respects, strains isolated in general medical practice were considerably more sensitive to classical as well as to newer antibiotics. Marked differences in resistance within individual medical services could be a reflection of both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the use of a given antibiotic. Urological and surgical wards, and in some respects pediatric and infectious diseases services, rendered the highest percentage of strains resistant to various drugs. There are still several antibiotics which are effective in vitro against staphylococci, while gentamicin, collistin and cotrimoxazole are the only antibiotics displaying more general activity against gram-negative "problem" bacteria. Nevertheless, strains from general practice show a good response in vitro, even to older antibiotics, despite the fact that these have been widely used for decades in general practice.

AB  - The effect of active and passive antibacterial immunization on transplantation immunity was investigated in rabbits. Immunization with dead bacterial vaccines prepared from E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudmonas aeruginosa had no effect on skin allograft survival, whereas immunization with vaccines prepared from streptococcal and staphylococcal strains shortened allograft survival. Similar results were obtained with specific antisera against individual microbial species. Skin allografts survived in rabbits treated with antisera against E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the same manner as in untreated controls, whereas allograft survival was shortened with antisera against streptococci or staphylococci. The possible mechanism of the stimulatory effect of Gram-positive cocci on transplantation immunity is discussed and the possibilities of using active and passive antibacterial immunication in clinical transplantation are considered.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Microbiological activity of cefazedone as compared to cefazolin and cephalothin.
AB  - In a comparison of the antibacterial activity of (6R,7R)-7-(2-[3,5-dichloro-4-oxo-1(4H)-pyridyl]-acetamido)-3-([5-methyl-1,3,4-thi adiazol-2-yl)-thio]methyl)-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4,2,0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid (cefazedone, Refosporen) as compared to other cephalosporins it can be seen that cefazedone possesses good activity against gram-positive bacteria; as regards activity against Enterobacteriaceae, in particular strains of E. coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis, they fall within the spectrum of activity of the substance.
TI  - HR 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  - HR 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus spp. (indole positive), Enterobacter spp., Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Providencia stuartii, and Staphylococcus aureus. In every comparison, except that with the last organism, HR 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. All three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, HR 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. HR 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Lancefield group D streptococci, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against Haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against Bacteriodes fragilis. HR 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. HR 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against S. pyogenes; against Lancefield group D, penicillin was 32 times as active as HR 756. HR 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (P. aeruginosa and group D streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. A series of seven transfers of selected strains of E. coli, Klebsiella spp., S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa through medium containing HR 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. Resistance to HR 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.

AB  - The Autobac I provides an automated method for the rapid measurement of antimicrobial susceptibility of fast growing pathogenic microorganisms. To check instrument accuracy, 477 cultures were tested by the Bauer-Kirby method for comparison. According to the DIN limits, the results were comparable in 81.8%, whereas within the NCCLS limits the agreement was 86.5%. The discrepancy was found to be due to incorrect disc mass and different limits of inhibitory zone diameters. Another reason for disagreement seemed to be the incubation time, since its influence on the results varied when different bacterium/antibiotic combinations were used.

TI  - In vitro activity of HR 756, a new cephalosporin compound.
AB  - The in vitro activity of HR 756, a new cephalosporin, has been determined against recent clinical isolates and compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. The geometric means of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for different isolates of Escherichia coli (100 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (84), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (121), Proteus mirabilis (52), indole-positive Proteus species (9), Salmonella species (19), Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-sensitive (29) and penicillin-resistant (39) were: 0.095, 0.124, 11.1, 0.095, 0.0107, 0.078, 1 and 0.95 mcg/ml, respectively. Its activity was affected by rise in inoculum against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa but not against K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Bactericidal activity was determined by membrane filtration method. HR 756 was found to be bactericidal to E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus species. Although the MICs of the tested S. aureus strains were 1 mcg/ml, 5 mcg/ml of HR 756 failed to kill 99% of the inoculum within 24 hours.

TI  - The antimicrobial activity of urine of paraplegic patients receiving methenamine  mandelate.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of urine collected from adult male paraplegics ingesting methenamine mandelate (MM) was evaluated. The in vitro bacterial growth in urine from these patients was inhibited when the free formaldehyde (HCHO) concentration was 10 to 22 microgram per ml. When the HCHO concentration was in the region of 28 microgram per ml or greater, bactericidal effect became apparent. Urine containing 1323 microgram of MM per ml with a pH of 5.9 when freshly voided had sufficient HCHO to be bacteriostatic. Urine containing at least 1740 microgram of MM per ml with a pH of 5.1 or less when freshly voided was bactericidal. The latter concentration of MM in urine was usually achieved when the patient ingested 4 g of MM per day in divided doses and the intake of fluid was not excessive. Under some circumstances an individual receiving MM without an additional acidifying agent may produce urine with a pH low enough to release sufficient HCHO to exert a useful antibacterial effect. However, supplementary acidification with ammonium chloride produced marked lowering of the urinary pH in all patients receiving MM, resulting in bactericidal levels of HCHO.
TI  - In vitro studies with Sch 21420 and Sch 22591: activity in comparison with six other aminoglycosides and synergy with penicillin against enterococci.
AB  - In vitro tests were performed with Sch 21420 and Sch 22591 to determine (i) their activity in comparison to six other aminoglycosides against 343 clinical isolates, and (ii) whether synergy with penicillin G could be demonstrated with enterococci. In broth dilution tests, Sch 22591 was more active than the seven other aminoglycosides against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. Sch 22591 was as active as tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of Sch 21420 was comparable to gentamicin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin but greater than amikacin or kanamycin against S. aureus and most genera of Enterobacteriaceae. Sch 21420, amikacin, and kanamycin were (i) more active than the other five aminoglycosides against Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii, but (ii) less active than the other five aminoglycosides against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, enterococci, most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus morganii. Studies on the bactericidal activity of Sch 22591 with penicillin indicated a synergistic interaction against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin. This could be demonstrated with combinations containing 3.0 to 6.0 mug of Sch 22591 per ml and was comparable to that observed with penicillin/gentamicin. Penicillin plus Sch 21420 (25 mug/ml) also demonstrated synergy against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin. However, synergy did not occur against strains highly resistant to kanamycin. These latter results were similar to those obtained in tests with penicillin/kanamycin.
TI  - Combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (BRL 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. Ticarcillin MICs were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. Thirty-nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested included Escherichia coli (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterobacter sp. (3), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Serratia marcescens (1), and Proteus mirabilis (1). Ticarcillin MICs for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Against 33 strains (85%), the MICs were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. In contrast, the MICs for seven of eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (MIC >/= 2,048 mug/ml) E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of BL-S786 compared with those of  other cephalosporins.
AB  - In vitro activity of BL-S786, a new parenterally semisynthetic cephalosporin, was investigated against 570 bacterial isolates. BL-S786 inhibited most Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella. It inhibited some Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, but it was less active against these later species than was cefamandole, cefuroxime, or cefoxitin. It was not active against Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Bacteroides fragilis. BL-S786 was the least active new cephalosporin tested against staphylococci and was less active than cephalothin against streptococcal species. The activity of BL-S786 was not altered by the type of assay medium nor by 50% serum. The size of the test inoculum altered the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations for inhibition of some organisms, particularly those with Richmond type I beta-lactamases. BL-S786 was not hydrolyzed by the R-factor-mediated, Richmond type III beta-lactamase, but it was hydrolyzed by type I beta-lactamases.
TI  - Azlocillin and mezlocillin: new ureido penicillins.
AB  - The activity of azlocillin and mezlocillin, new semisynthetic ureido penicillins, was investigated and compared with that of other known beta-lactam antibiotics. At a concentration of 25 mug/ml, azlocillin inhibited 74% of Enterobacter, 97% of Proteus mirabilis, 64% of Citrobacter, 91% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 82% of Bacteroides strains tested. Mezlocillin inhibited 86% of Shigella, 96% of Enterobacter, 80% of indole-positive Proteus, 88% of Bacteroides, and 63% of Pseudomonas strains tested. Azlocillin was more active against Pseudomonas than was ticarcillin, carbenicillin, or mezlocillin. Mezlocillin was more active than carbenicillin and ampicillin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Serratia, and Bacteroides. Azlocillin and mezlocillin were less active than cefazolin against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and Klebsiella strains but more active than cefazolin against Enterobacter, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia strains. Both compounds showed activity equivalent to that of cefoxitin against Bacteroides isolates. Both agents were destroyed by many of the beta-lactamases from gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Pharmacology and efficacy of netilmicin.
AB  - Twenty-six patients, 20 to 77 years of age, were treated with netilmicin, mean dose 2 mg/kg every 8 h intramuscularly or in a 20-min intravenous infusion. The mean serum half-lives in patients with creatinine clearances of >/=90 ml/min and 60 to 90 ml/min were 3.2 and 3.4 h, respectively. In patients with serum creatinines of </=1.4 mg/100 ml and creatinine clearances of >/=60 ml/min, mean serum levels were 9.0 and 1.2 mug/ml, respectively, 5 to 15 min and 7.5 h post-intravenous infusion, and 7.1 and 1.7 mug/ml, respectively, 1 and 8 h post-intramuscular injection. Twenty-five patients had acute pyelonephritis; 7 of the 25 had bacteremia. The infecting bacteria were Escherichia coli (15), Proteus mirabilis (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Enterobacter hafniae (1), and both Proteus rettgeri and Proteus morganii (1). All were inhibited by 6.3 mug of netilmicin per ml, except for the P. rettgeri, which required 25 mug/ml for inhibition. Of 23 patients who could be evaluated, 19 were bacteriologically and clinically cured at follow-up. Of the remaining four, one relapsed, two became reinfected, and one was lost to follow-up. Five patients developed nephrotoxicity; two of the five had previous renal insufficiency. Three patients, one with abnormal renal function, developed ototoxicity detected only with audiograms. These studies suggest that netilmicin is effective in serious gram-negative bacillary infections, but is nephrotoxic and ototoxic in humans.
TI  - Synergy of azlocillin and mezlocillin combined with aminoglycoside antibiotics and cephalosporins.
AB  - Synergistic activity between both azlocillin and mezlocillin and aminoglycosides  or cefazolin could be demonstrated by checkerboard dilution, isobologram, and killing curve techniques. Azlocillin and mezlocillin combined with gentamicin, netilmicin, or amikacin were synergistic against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Serratia, and indole-positive Proteus. Synergy was observed with isolates that were susceptible or resistant to azlocillin or mezlocillin. Synergy was seen most often when azlocillin or mezlocillin were combined with amikacin, gentamicin, or netilmicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination of mezlocillin and an aminoglycoside produced synergy more often than did carbenicillin plus an aminoglycoside. No antagonism was seen when aminoglycoside antibiotics were combined with azlocillin or mezlocillin. Cefazolin was synergistic against Pseudomonas, Providencia, P. mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus, Citrobacter, Klebsiella, and Escherichia coli, when combined with azlocillin or mezlocillin. However, the combination of either agent with cefazolin was antagonistic when tested against selected indole-positive Proteus and Enterobacter isolates.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of apalcillin (PC-904) against gram-negative bacilli, especially ampicillin-, carbenicillin-, and gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - Apalcillin (PC-904) is active against carbenicillin- and ampicillin-resistant strains of gram-negative bacilli. Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains highly resistant to carbenicillin (>/=3,200 mug/ml), half of them were susceptible to PC-904 at a concentration of 50 to 1,600 mug/ml. The minimal inhibitory concentration of PC-904 against P. aeruginosa strains resistant to carbenicillin (400 to 1,600 mug/ml) ranged from 3.1 to 25 mug/ml. Ampicillin- and carbenicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains were similarly susceptible to PC-904. However, drug resistance to PC-904 was already apparent among some strains of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and P. morganii, recently isolated in Japan; i.e., 4, 35, 32, 4, 6, and 14% of strains isolated were resistant. PC-904 was more active, on the other hand, than ampicillin and carbenicillin against antibiotic-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae and also showed high activity against most species of Pseudomonadaceae, especially P. cepacia and P. aeruginosa. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of PC-904 were greatly affected by inoculum size when the organisms tested were strains producing large amounts of beta-lactamase.
TI  - Sisomicin: in vitro activity and pharmacokinetics.
AB  - In vitro activity of sisomicin and gentamicin was compared in serial dilution tests for 619 bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Serratia marcescens). Mean MIC of sisomicin was lower by one geometrical dilution step compared with gentamicin for Pseudomonas, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella, and Serratia, while it was almost identical with the other species. Resistance (MIC greater than 5 microgram/ml) against sisomicin was observed in 2% of Pseudomonas strains, resistance against gentamicin in 8%. Ten healthy adult volunteers had serum peak levels (after i,m. injection of 40 mg and 80 mg sisomicin) of 2.7 and 3.2 microgram/ml. Urine recovery (in 24 hrs) was 76%. Continuous i.v. infusion of sisomicin or gentamicin (6.6 mg/hour in 7 healthy adult volunteers) yielded in serum levels of 0.64 and 1.03 microgram/ml respectively. Biological half-life (90 minutes), urine recovery (60% in the fourth hour), renal clearance and skin blister levels at the end of infusion were almost identical for both antibiotics; total clearance was somewhat higher with sisomicin than with gentamicin.
TI  - Activity of azlocillin and mezlocillin against gram-negative organisms: comparison with other penicillins.
AB  - The activities of azlocillin and mezlocillin were compared with those of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and pirbenicillin against a wide range of gram-negative organisms. The two new drugs were considerably more active than carbenicillin against Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli. Carbenicillin was twice as active against Proteus mirabilis as mezlocillin and four times as active as azlocillin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, azlocillin was eight times as active as carbenicillin. Azlocillin and mezlocillin were twice as active as carbenicillin against Bacteroides fragilis, and these drugs showed a high degree of activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Intestinal bacterial flora of the household lizard, Gecko gecko.
AB  - A total of 114 isolates was recovered from the intestines of 43 househould lizards, Gecko gecko. Among the important ones were Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Edwardsiella tarda.
TI  - Totally synthetic medium for susceptibility testing.
AB  - The results of disk diffusion and plate dilution susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis on media gelled with agar-agar or with a synthetic hydrogel were compared. Synthetic hydrogel can be combined with a totally defined synthetic amino acid medium to yield a reproducible, totally defined, synthetic solid medium without the antagonistic or booster effects of some components of agar. Such a medium could be used as a reference medium for susceptibility testing.
TI  - In vitro activity of piperacillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of activity.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin (T-1220), a new semisynthetic derivative of aminobenzylpenicillin, was investigated. The majority of streptococci and pneumococci were inhibited by 0.12 micrograms/ml; the staphylococci and enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin was slightly more active against Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae than was ampicillin. Piperacillin was active against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae including the Klebsiella, 58% of which were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml. The activity of piperacillin was at least equivalent, but generally superior, to that of ampicillin or carbenicillin on species susceptible to these drugs. Most striking was its activity on Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml, and 83% were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. The minimum bactericidal concentrations were very close to the minimum inhibitory concentrations, and in most species only a slight inoculum effect was observed on the minimum bacterial values except for certain P. aeruginosa strains. A complete parallel resistance exists between piperacillin and ampicillin or carbenicillin. However, the clinical importance of this is largely mitigated by the intrinsically higher activity of piperacillin.
TI  - PC-904, a new semisynthetic penicillin.
AB  - Sodium 6{d(-)-alpha(4-hydroxyl-1,5 naphthyridine-3-carboxamido)phenylacetamido} penicillanate (PC-904) is a new semisynthetic penicillin with broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. At a concentration of 1.56 mug/ml, it inhibited 100% of isolates of Proteus mirabilis, 89% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 67% of Escherichia coli, and 45% of Enterobacter spp. At a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, it inhibited 75% of Klebsiella spp. and 67% of Serratia marcescens. PC-904 failed to inhibit the growth of gram-negative bacilli when large inocula were used. Some differences were noted when organisms were tested in different media or at different hydrogen ion concentrations. It is more active than mezlocillin, azlocillin, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and amoxicillin against E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and P. aeruginosa.

TI  - Nocardicin A, a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic IV. Factors influencing the in vitro activity of Nocardicin A.
AB  - Factors influencing the in vitro antimicrobial activity of nocardicin A against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were investigated. Sodium chloride was identified as a major inhibitor. Some of the amino acids, sugars and divalent cations were found to be minor inhibitors. The presence of potassium phosphates enhanced nocardicin A activity against P. aeruginosa, but antagonized the activity against P. mirabilis.
TI  - Nocardicin A, a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic III. In vitro evaluation.
AB  - Nocardicin A, a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic, exerts a comparatively potent antimicrobial activity against gram-negative organisms, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus groups (except Pr. morganii), Serratia marcescens and the Neisseria groups. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of nocardicin A against clinical isolates of Ps. aeruginosa was about twice that of carbenicillin. The mean MICs of nocardicin A for Pr. mirabilis, Pr. rettgeri and Pr. inconstans ranged from 3.13 to 12.5 microgram/ml and were 25 similar to 50 microgram/ml for Pr. vulgaris. Nocardicin A in concentrations of 12.5 similar to 50 microgram/ml inhibited 30 strains (48 percent) of S. marcescens usually resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, nocardicin A had no significant in vitro activity against Staphylococci and Escherichia coli. No cross-resistance was seen between nocardicin A and other beta-lactam antibiotics. This antibiotic was stable to beta-lactamase. The in vitro activity of nocardicin A against Ps. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis was greatly influenced by the assay media used. Nocardicin A was bactericidal and appeared to act synergistically with serum bactericidal factors against Ps. aeruginosa and with polymorphonuclear leukocytes against Ps. aeruginosa, E. coli and Pr. vulgaris. The bactericidal activity of nocardicin A against the above 3 organisms, therefore, increased markedly in the presence of fresh serum and polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
TI  - Nocardicin A, a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic V. In vivo evaluation.
AB  - Nocardicin A is a new monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic which provides a potent therapeutic effect in mice experimentally infected with gram-negative bacilli. When given subcutaneously to mice, the therapeutic effect of the drug was stronger than had been anticipated from in vitro studies. Nocardicin A was more potent in therapeutic effect than carbenicillin against infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Pr. vulgaris, Pr. rettgeri and Pr. inconstans, and was similar in effect to carbenicillin against infections due to Escherichia coli in mice. In addition, nocardicin A proved to be active against infections due to Serratia marcescens and other organisms resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. When nocardicin A was given subcutaneously to mice, blood and hepatic levels of the drug were higher than those of carbenicillin.

TI  - A polyvalent human gamma-globulin immune to Pseudomonas aeruginosa: passive protection of mice against lethal infection.
AB  - As a means to development of guidelines for therapeutic application to human disease, preparations of human polyvalent gamma-globulin immune to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PG) were studied in acute infections in mice. PG was highly effective in controlling lethal infections induced in mice by the major immunotypes of P. aeruginosa; greater than or equal to 10 microgram of of gamma-globulin per mouse protected against challenge with less than or equal to 10(6) 50% lethal doses of P. aeruginosa. PG was less than or equal to 57 times more effective than normal human gamma-globulin. The active antibody component is specific for each immunotype; it is of the IgG type and undoubltedly is directed against the O-antigen. PG was was not protective against challenge with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae; a low degree of cross-protection was seen against Serratia marcescens. In a model infection involving mice in a terminal stage of advanced P. aeruginosa infection, human plasma immune to P. aeruginosa proved ineffective, but the gamma-globulin component showed moderate activity. The apparent irreversibility of this late-stage infection is not clearly ascribable to a toxin. It is postulated that the successful treatment of advanced P. aeruginosa infections in humans would require multiple therapeutic approaches, including passive immunization with a high-potency, specifically immune globulin.
TI  - Plantar ulcers with osteomyelitis underneath. A bacteriological study.
AB  - 39 consecutive cases of plantar ulcers with underlying chronic osteomyelitis admitted in the Sacred Heart Hospital during 1975/1976 were studied for the infecting organisms and their sensitivity to easily available antibiotics. Single organism was iasolated in only 10 cases, the infection in the rest being a mixed one. The commonest organisms were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Proteus mirabilis. In a few cases Pseudomonas and E-Coli were also isolated. Chloramphenicol was the most effective antibiotic in general and Streptomycin the least. 70% of the staphylococcus strains isolated were found to be resistant to Penicillin. Empirical use of antibiotics especially Penicillin and Streptomycin is hence deprecated.

TI  - Activation of complement by opportunist pathogens and chemotypes of Salmonella minnesota.
AB  - Washed cells of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella minnesota chemotypes (S, Rb, and Re) were tested for their ability to activate the alternative complement pathway (ACP). Parameters of ACP activation were (i) conversion of C3 in 10 mM ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N1-tetraacetic acid-treated human serum supplemented with 2.5 mM MgCl2, (ii) lysis of glutathione-treated human erythrocytes in the presence of human serum, and (iii) C3 to C9 consumption in C4-deficient guinea pig serum. With the exception of S. minnesota Re and S. aureus, all of the strains were highly active in the test systems when compared with inulin. S. minnesota Re and S. aureus initiated C3 conversion in untreated human serum, suggesting that these microorganisms were capable of activating complement by a mechanism other than the ACP. These results provide direct evidence for ACP activation by opportunist gram-negative bacilli and refute the hypothesis that the lipid A moiety of the lipopolysaccharide cell wall is responsible for ACP activation.
TI  - Studies on quinoline derivatives and related compounds. 5. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel 1-alkoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids.
AB  - A series of novel 1-alkoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids was synthesized and screened as antimicrobial agents. The most active compounds in vitro against gram-negative microorganisms and Staphylococcus aureus were 1,4-dihydro-1-methoxy-6,7-methylenedioxy-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (22), 1,2,6,9-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-9-oxofuro[3,2-f]quinoline-8-carboxylic acid (30, and 2,3,6,9-tetrahydro-6-methoxy-3-methyl -2,9-dioxothiazolo [5,4-f]quinoline-8-carboxylic acid (34). These compounds had antigram-negative activity comparable to that of the corresponding N-ethyl derivatives 1, 2, and 4. Their serum levels and urinary recovery rates in rats, however, were significantly improved relative to the latter compounds (1,2, and 4).
TI  - Clavulanic acid: a beta-lactamase-inhiting beta-lactam from Streptomyces clavuligerus.

Conditions for the cultivation of the organism and detection and isolation of clavulanic acid are described. This compound resembles the nucleus of a penicillin but differs in having no acylamino side chain, having oxygen instead of sulfur, and containing a beta-hydroxyethylidine substituent in the oxazolidine ring. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of many beta-lactamases, including those found in Escherichia coli (plasmid mediated), Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition being of a progressive type. The cephalosporinase type of beta-lactamase found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae P99 and the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. coli are less well inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and cephaloridine against beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and E. coli have been shown to be considerably reduced by the addition of low concentrations of clavulanic acid.
TI  - Intracellular crystalline deposits by bacteria grown in urine from a stone former.
AB  - Several species of bacteria were found to form an intracellular crystalline material when grown in urine obtained from a subject with a history of infrequent renal calculi formation. The following species: Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans formed crystals of hydroxyapatite. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris produced crystals of calcite -II. Several of these bacteria have been isolated from the kidneys of patients with renal caculi indicationg that microorganisms may be involved in the nucleation process during calculogenesis.
TI  - [Studies on the activation of humoral defense factors against bacteria in larvae  of the wax moth Galleria mellonella L].
AB  - The change of lysozyme activity in the hemolymph of the wax moth larvae caused by vaccination is influenced by the size and the dose of the injected particles. The rate of incorporation of those particles into phagocytes has no effect on this process. The change of lysozyme activity correlats negatively with the amount of granulocytes after vaccination. There were no correlations with the amount of other types of the hemocytes, neither with the resistance of the larvae against Pseudomonas aeruginosa nor with the survival of gram-negative bacteria within the hemocoelom. Origin, regulation and role of lysozyme are discussed regarding the defence against gram-negative bacteria. In the hemolymph of wax moth larvae after vaccination the formation of spheroblasts has been observed with all gram-negative strains of bacteria studied. The speed and extent of the formation of spheroblasts corresponded to the pathogenicity of these bacteria for the larvae as well as to the survival of the bacteria within the hemocoelom.
TI  - Sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria to six aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  - An in vitro study of the susceptibility of 201 newly isolated strains of gramnegative bacteria to six aminoglycoside antibiotics (kanamycin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin and netilmicin) was performed by the twofold dilution method in fluid medium. Both the minimal inhibitory concentration and the minimal bacteridical concentration were determined. Overall, tobramycin seemed the most effective of the drugs studied. Netilmicin, the new derivative from sisomicin, compared favourably with the other drugs tested, but may, on theoretical grounds, offer the additional advantage of retained efficacy in the face of developing bacterial resistance. Not unexpectedly, amikacin appeared to be the most promising of the drugs studied in its action against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin and netilmicin appeared to be the most effective of this group of antibiotics against Klebsiella species.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of Proteus, Pseudomonas pyocyanea and staphyloccoci isolated from scleroma and ozena patients].
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity of 292 strains of Proteus, 60 strains of Ps, aeruginosa, 309 strains of S. aureus and 88 strains of S. epidermidis isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients with scleroma and ozena was studied. The cultures of Pr. mirabilis were sensitive to aminoglucosides (54.9-96.2 per cent) and Pr. morganii were sensitive to levomycetin (81.5 per cent) and neomycin (92.6 per cnet). Sensitivity of Pr. vulgaris and Pr. morganii was reliably higher (p less than 0.001) than that of Pr. mirabilis. The strains of Pr. morganii were less sensitive to monomycin (P less than 0.001) and streptomycin (p less than 0.01) as compared to the cultures of other Proteus species tested. The strains of Ps. aeruginosa were sensitive only to gentamicin (90 per cent) and neomycin (81.1 per cent). Most of the strains of S. aureus (85.4-100 per cent) were sensitive to oleadomycin, erythromycin, olemorphocycline, tetraolean, oxacillin, methicillin ceporin, lincomycin, ristomycin, kanamycin, monomycin and gentamicin. Benzylpenicillin (90.8 per cent of the sensitive strains), ampicillin (67.1 per cent), tetracycline (66.7 per cent), levomycetin (68.6 per cent) and streptomycin (38.1 per cent) were less effective. Antibacterial therapy in cases with scleroma and ozena should be directed not only against causative agents of the diseases but also against the microbes developing due to disbacteriosis. Combination of parenteral and local use of the antibiotics in the treatment of chronic clebsiellesis decreased the isolation rate of Proteus and Ps. aeruginosa in the patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of netilmicin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of netilmicin (Sch 20569), a new semisynthetic derivative of gentamicin, was compared with that of gentamicin and amikacin. One hundred and ninety-two clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were tested using both agar and broth dilution techniques. Netilmicin was comparable to gentamicin, with the following exceptions: (i) for Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa, gentamicin was more active than netilmicin; (ii) all strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, and Citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin; (iii) some strains of S. marcescens, indole-positive Proteus, and Providencia, which were resistant to gentamicin, were susceptible to netilmicin. Netilmicin was more active than amikacin for all Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus and equal to amikacin in activity against gentamicin-susceptible strains of P. aeruginosa. All strains of P. aeruginosa, resistant to gentamicin, were also resistant to netilmicin but were susceptible to amikacin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) obtained with broth and agar showed no significant differences except for P. mirabilis, where broth MICs were twofold greater than agar MICs, and for P. aeruginosa, where agar MICs were twofold higher than broth MICs. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was either identical to or within one twofold dilution of the MIC for the strains tested. A 100-fold increase in inoculum size produced less increase in MIC and MBC with netilmicin than with gentamicin or amikacin.
TI  - Fosfomycin, antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of fosfomycin were investigated both in vitro and in vivo for the purpose of comparative evaluation on its fundamental properties with other antimicrobial agents. The MIC was determined with nutrient agar (Difco) inoculated with one loopful of 1,000-fold dilution (about 10(6) cells/ml) of bacterial suspension cultured overnight in nutrient broth. This substance showed antibacterial activity to most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, being strongest to Enterobacteriaceae with a peak of the MIC at 1.56 mug/ml in Salmonella. It was also active against P. aeruginosa with a peak of the MIC at 6.25 mug/ml in its sensitivity distribution. Intravenous and subcutaneous fosfomycin Na salt and oral fosfomycin Ca salt were given to 5-week-old ddN strain male mice challenged with clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, E. coli and P. mirabilis. Therapeutic effect was observed in all these test organisms. In P. aeruginosa, it was more effective than carbenicillin.
TI  - R plasmids coding for gentamicin, tobramycin, and carbenicillin resistance in Serratia, Klebsiella and Escherichia coli strains from a single clinical source.
AB  - Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli strains bearing transferable resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, namely, gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, lividomycin, and carbenicillin, as well as to a series of more classical drugs, began to emerge in materials from the Frankfurt University Hospital. Plasmids from Serratia, Klebsiella, and E. coli exhibit a broad host range in that they are transferable to E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium receipients. They are not transferable to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although in that species plasmids of gentamicin and tobramycin resistance, was well as of resistance to further drugs, were detected in that area as early as in 1973. High-level carbenicillinase has been identified in Serratia and Klebsiella plasmids associated with drug resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - Tobramycin, amikacin, sissomicin, and gentamicin resistant Gram-negative rods.
AB  - Sensitivities to gentamicin, sissomicin, tobramycin, and amikacin were compared in 196 gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative rods and in 212 similar organisms sensitive to gentamicin, mainly isolated from clinical specimens. Amikacin was the aminoglycoside most active against gentamicin-resistant organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Proteus spp, Providencia spp, and Citrobacter spp being particularly susceptible. Most of the gentamicin-resistant organisms were isolated from the urine of patients undergoing surgery. Gentamicin was the most active antibiotic against gentamicin-sensitive E coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia spp. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp were most susceptible to tobramycin.
TI  - [In vitro action and clinical use of indanyl carbenicillin].
AB  
TI  - [Maceration of the interdigital spaces and gram-negative infection of feet].
AB  - The microbiological flora of the macerated skin of the interdigital spaces of the feet of 64 patients were compared to those of 64 other control patients who had normal toe webs. In the control group coagulase-negative staphylococci and aerobic corynebacteria ("diphtheroids") were the most common bacteria found compared to a great number of different organisms including a high percentage of potentially pathogenic bacteria and fungi that were isolated from the macerated toe webs. The clinical appearance was not helpful in suggesting the nature of the causative organism. In order to prevent therapeutical errors bacteriological and mycological cultures are necessary before treatment.
TI  - Protection against Gram-negative infection by 'super-active' antigen.
AB  - 'Super-active' antigens modified antigens released from bacteria which had been phagocytosed and killed by human leucocytes, were found to induce protective responses in mice within 24 h of immunization. At the earliest time (24 h) when immunized mice were protected against lethal intrapertoneal (i.p.) challenge by the bacteria from which which the 'super-active' antigens were made (Proteus mirabilis) the leucocytes of peripheral blood from immunized mice showed enhanced phagocytosis and killing of autologous bacteria and there was an increase in the number of lymphocytes producing anti-proteus antibody. Another mouse protective factor inducing transient protection lasting 1-2 days against lethal i.p. challenge by P. mirabilis was found in preparations of lysed heman leucocytes not engaged in phagocytosis. Burned mice, immunized with 'super-active' antigen preparations were protected against lethal invasive proteus infection, inoculated on to the burn surface, 2 h after burning and immunization.
TI  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin C derivative I. In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6R,7R)-8-oxo-7[2-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. Ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris. The activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. Cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of P. mirabilis. The in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. Ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both S. aureus and E. coli. The development in vitro of resistance by S. aureus 209p and E. coli NIHJ to ceftezole after 16 transfers was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. Ceftezole was relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. Ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. However, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. Furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with S. aureus.
TI  - Multiple drug resistance in Klebsiella-Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa--an analysis of all-nation computer-processed data.
AB  - This last communication on the results of an one-year computer follow-up of single, double, and multiple antibiotic resistance of so-called problem bacteria in Slovakia presents computerised data on double, and important triple, quadruple and quintuple resistance of Klebsiella-Enterobacter, P. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa strains. Bi- and multi-resistant strains absolutely prevail in Klebsiella (more than 60% of many thousands of strains tested), P. mirabilis (90%) and Ps. aeruginosa (95%). Special strict surveillance should be imposed on these strains, namely on those coming from hospitals, and on their resistance developments concerning those few drugs which are fully (gentamicin and colistin, except for Proteus) or individually effective (streptomycin, carbenicillin, septrin, nalidixic acid). Mutual co-selectivity of bi-resistance has been identified in Klebsiella-Aerobacter toward gentamycin-colistin. Although this does not take place in Ps. aeruginosa, it is similar to the development in E. coli, and to the one-way co-selection of combined oxacillin-lincomycin resistance in staphylococci in this country. Should this co-selective trend continue, even promoted by the spread of R plasmids, it may happen that the treatment of infections caused especially by these three (or four) species will be seriously jeopardized.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of activity of sisomicin and gentamicin in mouse protection tests with gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The efficacy of sisomicin and gentamicin was compared in mouse protection studies against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was no significant difference in mortality of the mice in any of the protocol groups when five different dosages of sisomicin and gentamicin given by three separate schedules were compared for each bacterial inoculum in each antibiotic protocol. The mean protective dose values of sisomicin were at least one-half those of gentamicin for each protocol against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Susceptibility of "enterobacteria" to penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycins, erythromycin, and rifampin.
AB  - Agar dilution tests for susceptibility of gram-negative rods and enterococci were done with a number of penicillins, cephalosporins, lincomycin analogues, erythromycin, and rifampin. Many in the first three categories were investigational drugs. All were generally less active than aminoglycoside and tetracycline antibiotics against gram-negative rods and more active against enterococci. Cephalosporins as a group were more active than penicillins against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and less active enterococci. Both groups were equally active against Enterobacter, Proteus, and Providencia but inactive against most strains of Serratia and all strains of Pseudomonas; however, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and BL-1654 were active against most strains of Pseudomonas. Penicillins and cephalosporins were more active against Proteus mirabilis than against indole-positive Proteus. Lincomycins had little or no activity against gram-negative rods but were moderately active against enterococci. Erythromycin was more active than the lincomycins, but rifampin was much more active than either of these types of drug. Of the penicillins, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, and BL-P1654 were the most active against gram-negative rods, whereas BL-P1654, amoxicillin, and ampicillin were the most active against enterococci. The penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cyclacillin, and penicillin V were essentially inactive against gram-negative rods. Of the cephalosporins tested, cephanone and cefamandole were the most active against most gram-negative rods, whereas cephaloridine and cephacetrile were the most active against enterococci. The least active of the cephalosporins against most species were cephradine, cephalexin, and cephapirin, but cefoxitin was the least active against enterococci.
TI  - Oral vaccination against Porteus mirabilis.
AB  - Mice given a single dose of proteus vaccine orally were protected against 1 MLD (minimum lethal dose) of autologous Proteus mirabilis by the fourth day after vaccination. Three doses of oral vaccine induced protection against 1 MLD autologous challenge for 7 days after vaccination and partial protection for a further 8 weeks. Cross-protection against different strains of Pr. mirabilis and against some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Providencia species was found in mice immunized orally on three consecutive days with a bivalent proteus vaccine.
TI  - Factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  - The effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus (Smith), Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. With P. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. Passive immunity against P. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized P. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. With S. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. These data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. The results further demonstrate that with P. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in combination against  bacteria associated with intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and minocycline alone and in  combination were determined by a broth microdilution method for 100 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic isolates representative of pathogens recovered from patients with intra-abdominal sepsis. Gentamicin inhibited all strains of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in concentrations of 0.4 to 3.1 mug/ml and all strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis in concentrations of 0.8 to 12.5 mug/ml. Whereas minocycline did not consistently inhibit these organisms in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with gentamicin against 43% of the Enterobacteriaceae tested in clinically achievable concentrations; significant synergy was most common with E. coli (60%). Minocycline inhibited 62% of Bacteroides fragilis, 71% of Clostridium, 40% of anaerobic cocci, and 40% of enterococci tested in concentrations of 1.6 mug or less/ml. Whereas gentamicin rarely inhibited these organisms in concentrations of 6.2 mug or less/ml, it did act synergistically with minocycline against 20% of B. fragilis, 67% of Clostridium, 22% of anaerobic cocci, and 22% of enterococci (which had minimal inhibitory concentrations of minocycline within the range tested) at clinically achievable concentrations. Although only four (13%) of the 30 isolates resistant to both gentamicin and minocycline alone were inhibited by clinically achievable concentrations of the combination, the observed synergy, particularly against strains of E. coli, was considered to be of potential clinical usefulness. Antagonism between gentamicin and minocycline was not observed at the concentrations tested.
TI  - [Studies on the distribution of thienylcarbenicillin in the human tissue].
AB  - Thienylcarbenicillin is another semisynthetic penicillin with a wide range of antibacterial activity including most of gram-negative bacterias, even such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To investigate penetration activities into bone and another tissues, 120 specimens of serum and 120 specimens of tissue were obtained from 20 patients, after i.v. injection of a single doses of 150 mg thienylcarbenicillin per kg body weight. The evaluation of concentration showed that Thienylcarbenicillin was eliminated from serum in a half-life time of 77 minutes. The concentration varied in different tissues. Maximal levels were found in musculature and in spongy bone. Unexpected high concentrations were found in fascia and in cutis. The lowest concentration was found in subcutis and compact bone. The experimental doses of 150 mg/kg body weight was not enough to gain a sufficient therapeutical level in compact bone.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefoxitin and cefamandole.
AB  - Cefoxitin and cefamandole were evaluated in vitro against 263 organisms. Studies  were performed in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth and agar employing inoculum sizes of 10(6) and 10(8) organisms per ml. At obtainable serum levels both antibiotics were bactericidal for nearly all strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus but were inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus. In agar, cefamandole appeared to be active against most strains of Enterobacter and indole-positive Proteus, whereas cefoxitin was active against indole-positive Proteus but not Enterobacter. Moreover, in broth medium most strains of Enterobacter were not readily inhibited by either antibiotic and only 40 and 73% of indole-positive Proteus were inhibited by 10 mug of cefamandole per ml in Mueller-Hinton and nutrient broth, respectively. However, in both broth media, 10 mug of cefoxitin per ml continued to be inhibitory and bactericidal for most isolates of indole-positive Proteus. Cefoxitin also was bactericidal against four cephalothin-resistant strains of E. coli. These data suggest that cefoxitin broadens the spectrum of existing cephalosporins by enhancing the activity against indole-positive Proteus species as well as some other Enterobacteriaceae. On the other hand, with the exception of strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, the apparent increased in vitro activity of cefamandole was demonstrated in agar and not in broth.
TI  - [Sensitivity of bacteria causing urinary tract infections towards terizidon (author's transl)].
AB  - In agar diffusion tests 2603 bacterial strains of species known to cause urinary  tract infections were tested routinely in regard to their sensitivity towards Terizidon, a derivative of cycloserine. In order to relate the results which were obtained in terms of the diameter of the inhibiton zone, to the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 304 of these strains were tested additionally in agar dilution tests. The MICs of the other strains were estimated from the results of these tests. Since it is known that after the oral administration of 500 mg Terizidon the urine contains, on average, more than 128 mug/ml Terizidon for 12 hours and longer, it may be concluded from the results of this investigation that 75% of the strains of E. coli and Citrobacter, 45% of enterobacter, 40% of Proteus mirabilis and enterococci, 35% of the indole-positive Proteus strains and 30% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa would have been successfully attacked by Terizidon in the case or urinary tract infections. By contrast, Klebsiella must be reagarded as being completely resistant to this antibiotic. It follows that the administration of Terizidon is mainly indicated in the treatment of acute urinary tract infections with E. coli as the predominant causative agent.
TI  - Absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids present in lipopolysaccharides from various bacterial groups.
AB  - The absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids has been studied, which are present in the lipopolysaccharides of the following bacteria: Phodopseudomonas gelatinosa, Rh. viridis, Rhodospirillum tenue, Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bordetella pertussis, Vibrio metchnikovii, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The 3-hydroxy acids were liberated by strong alkaline hydrolysis, converted to 3-methoxy acid L-phenylethylamides and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. With the aid of authentic D-3-hydroxy fatty acids it was shown for all lipopolysaccharides that the 3-hydroxy acids, regardless of chain lengths, branching, 3-O-substitution or type of linkage, possess the D-configuration. 2-Hydroxydodecanoic acid, which is present in some lipopolysaccharides, was analyzed in an analogous way and shown to possess the L-configuration.
TI  - Tobramycin: in vitro and clinical evaluation in 30 patients.
AB  - Clinical evaluation of intramuscular tobramycin was accomplished in 30 patients with respiratory, soft tissue, urinary tract, bone or septicemic infections due to gram negative bacilli. Median sensitivity to tobramycin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (19 strains) was 0.62 mug/ml and range 0.31-2.5 mug/ml; less activity was observed for Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter species isolates but median minimum inhibitory concentrations were less than or equal to 2.5 mug/ml. Therapy resulted in clinical and bacteriologic cures in 16 patients (53 per cent) including 13 of 16 (181 per cent) with urinary tract infections; 9 of the 14 patients who did not obtain bacteriologic cure had satisfactory clinical responses. Tobramycin was effective for selected gram negative bacillary infections and particularly for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Clinical experience with tobramycin in the treatment of infections due to gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Tobramycin, a new aminocyclitol antimicrobial agent, was administered parenterally to 28 patients infected with gram-negative bacilli. The dosage was 1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours, except in patients with renal insufficiency in whom the dosage interval was 10 times the serum creatinine in hours. Serum levels after intramuscular administration were 3.9 +/- 1.6 mug/ml and 1.0 +/- 0.7 mug/ml at 2 and 8 hours, respectively. Serum levels after intravenous administration were 4.6 +/- 0.5 mug/ml, 2.3 +/- 0.6 mug/ml, and 0.6 +/- 0.8 mug/ml at 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 8 hours, respectively. Clinical isolates included 21 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 of Serratia marcescens, and also isolates of E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tobramycin, gentamicin, sisomicin, and amikacin were determined for these organisms. Clinical results included 18 cures, 3 improvements, 2 indeterminates, and 6 failures. Minimal hepatic and renal toxicity was observed.
TI  - Pirbenicillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with broad-spectrum activity.
AB  - Pirbenicillin is a new semisynthetic penicillin which inhibited 67% of isolates of Proteus aeruginosa tested in our laboratory, 93% of P. mirabilis, 31% of Enterobacter spp., 41% of Serratia spp., and 58% of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 6.25 mug/ml. Its activity appeared to be inoculum dependent and it was virtually inactive against 10(7) inocula of P. aeruginosa. It was more active than carbenicillin or ticarcillin, but less active than BL-P1654 against P. aeruginosa. Carbenicillin and ticarcillin appeared to be more active than pirbenicillin against Proteus spp., but pirbenicillin was active against some isolates of Klebsiella spp.
TI  - Diversity of beta-lactamase activity among clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Various properties (specific activity, inducibility, substrate profile, and susceptibility to inhibitors) of the beta-lactamase activity present in 39 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated during a two-month period in the bacteriology laboratory of a large general hospital were investigated. Among the 39 strains there appeared to be at least 16 distinct enzymes. Most enzymes from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus morganii were active against both penicillins and cephalosporins, whereas those from Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed activity primarily against cephalosporins. Both types of enzyme were found among strains of Enterobacter. There was a general correlation between amount of enzymic activity and levels of resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. Discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. Discrepancies between enzymic activity and resistance may be due to variations in the roles intrinsic mechanisms play in resistance to various antibiotics.
TI  - Accelerated healing in infected wounds.
AB  - The effect of a standardized infection of pure and mixed cultures of gram-negative bacteria and a gram-positive coccus was studied in laparotomy wounds of rats. The infections were significantly stronger than in the control group wounds in 14 of 15 comparisons. This increased strength could not be correlated with an increased wound content of collagen. Results of histologic studies showed a vigorous inflammatory response which probably was responsible for the increased strength. There was a suggestion in our data to support the concept that certain bacteria evoke the proper inflammatory response to result in stronger wounds, while others provoke too little or too much inflammation.
TI  - [Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides in gram negative bacteria. 1. Molecular and genetic characterization of R-factors (author's transl)].
AB  - With frequent use of aminoglycoside antimicrobials and beta-lactam antibiotics in hospitals in the last few years, the number of bacterial strains resistant to these chemotherapeutics increased. Lately, strains of E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Proteus and Pseudomonas resistant to many antimicrobials (ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, tobramycin, sisomycin, neomycin, paromomycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, sulphonamides) were isolated from patients of the university hospital in Zuerich. The resistant phenotype of two representative strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae 1 and Serratia marcescens 2) could be transferred by mixed cultivation to E. coli K-12. Multiple resistance of strain 1, and addition, could be transferred to Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Providencia, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in varying frequencies. Transfer to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, could not be achieved. Spontaneous instability of resistance was observed in 0.15% of the cells of an overnight brothe culture and in 90% of the cells of a three months old culture. Conjugation, instability and the response to the sex phages MS-2 and If-1 suggested that resistance was mediated by a monomolecular R-factor, belonging to the fi+-type. This suggestion was confirmed by molecular characterization of the resistance plasmids. After transfer of the R-factors of K. pneumoniae 1 (R-FK 1) and Serratia marcescens 2 (R-FK2) into E. coli K-12, plasmid DNA was labelled with (methyl-3H) thymidine, and isolated by isopycnic centrifugation in cesiumchlorid-ethidium-bromide. Analysis of plasmid DNA then was carried out by sedimentation in a 5-20% neutral sucrose gradient together with reference plasmids of known molecular weights and sedimentation constants. The analysis revealed that R-FK1 had a molecular weight of 54 X 10(6) and R-FK2 of 50 X 10(6) daltons. The values were confirmed by contour length measurements of open circular forms with an electron microscope. A comparison of the sedimentation profile of labelled plasmid DNA from strain 1 and 14C-labelled DNA of E. coli K-12 (R-FK1) showed that the wild-type strain contained, besides the large resistance plasmid, at least two smaller "cryptic" plasmids. These smaller plasmid molecules were also found in antibiotic susceptible variants of strain 1, which did not contain the 54 X 10(6) dalton plasmid molecule, responsible for the resistant phenotype. The number of copies of R-FK1 in E. coli K-12 was determined to be 2, indicating stringent control of replication. It is discussed that the growing number of isolations of strains of Escherichia, Klebsiella, Serratia, Proteus, Providencia and Pseudomonas, exhibiting the same resistance phenotype, results from the spread of the R-factor described above among the hospital bacterial flora.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. This was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. Wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. In similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.
TI  - Studies of introital colonization in women with recurrent urinary infections. V.  The inhibitory activity of normal vaginal fluid on Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Normal vaginal fluid from premenopausal volunteers was inoculated with 10 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 14 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at pH's of 4.3, 4.6 and 4.9. All bacteria were killed at pH 4.3. Nine of 10 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 12 of 14 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at pH 4.6. Only 4 of 14 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were killed at pH 4.9, while 8 of 10 strains of Proteus mirabilis were killed at the same pH. We conclude that in comparison to the common 0 group strains of Escherichia coli, vaginal fluid is more bactericidal to Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and that these observations may help explain the relative infrequency of bacteriuria owing to the organisms.

TI  - [Clinical studies on gentamicin (author's transl)].
AB  - Gentamicin (GM) was studied for on its antibacterial activity, absorption, and excretion, effect on the kidney and clinical effects. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Antibacterial activity: The susceptibility of E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis to GM was almost the same between the periods of 1964 to 1966 and 1972 to 1974: No tendency of increase of resistance by year was noted. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains showing sensitivity to a concentration of more than 25 mcg/ml were isolated in 12.7%, in the latter period (1972-1974), as compared with the former period (1964-1966), which was 0%. 2. Blood levels: The peak level of GM in blood was obtained at 30 minutes after intramuscular injection to a healthy human. The peak level was 7.6 mcg/ml with 40 mg dose, 8.7 mcg/ml with 60 mg and 10.6 mcg/ml with 80 mg, showing a dose-responding curve. The half-life of GM absorption was 1.1 hours with 40 mg dose, 1.3 hours with 60 mg and 1.6 hours with 80 mg, showing also a dose related tendency. 3. Urinary levels: The peak level of GM in urine, about 200 mcg/ml, was noted in 0-2 hours after intramuscular injection of GM to a healthy human. The urinary recovery was about 44% in 6 hours. 4. Effect on the kidney: The effects of GM on the kidney was studied in rats administering 20 mg/kg once a day for 21 days consecutively. The results obtained are a slight increase (20 mg/dl) in BUN and a slight decrease (2,600 mosm/kg H2O) in urinary osmotic pressure; and urea lysozyme showed tendency to increase from the third day, the same as with kanamycin. Meanwhile, in the histopathological findings of the kidney tissue, the vacuolar degeneration and flattening of renal tubules were noted. Similar findings were obtained with kanamycin in a similar type of experiment. These results indicate that nephrotoxicity of GM is considered to be approximately the same as that of kanamycin. 5. CLINICAL RESULTS: GM was injected into 22 patients with various infectious diseases (respiratory tract infections 7, liver abscess 1, urinary tract infections 14). Excellent efficacy was noted in 7 patients, good in 13 and no effect in 2. The effective rate was 90.9%. No serious side effect was noted in this clinical trial.
TI  - Polymicrobic bacteriuria: significant association with bacteremia.
AB  - Current clinical practice states that a urine culture yielding three or more isolates must be considered a contaminated specimen and discarded. The validity of this practice was tested by reviewing all patients at the West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital with positive blood cultures for 1 year to determine how many were associated with polymicrobic bacteriuria (two or more urine isolates each present at greater than 10(5) colonies/ml). During 1973 there were 18 patients who had bacteremia associated with a urinary tract infection in which the same organism with the identical antibiogram was found in both the blood and the urine of these 18 patients with monomicrobic bacteremia 11(61%) had polymicrobic bacteriuria, with a mean of an additional 1.75 urinary pathogens present in significant quantities. In these patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria, an indwelling bladder catheter was present for a mean period of 4.4 months before the episode of bacteremia. Only 5 of the 11 patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria had temporally associated urinary tract manipulation. Monomicrobic bacteriuria occurred in seven patients (39%). The mean indwelling bladder catheter time was 0.9 days, and urinary tract manipulation near the time of bacteremia occurred in all seven patients. Prospectively, nine other patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria were recultured by one of us to be certain that appropriate collection and transportation methods were used; the presence of polymicrobic bacteriuria was repeatedly demonstrated in 7(78%). This study illustrates the clinical importance of polymicrobic bacteriuria.
TI  - Beta-lactam antibiotics with N-oxide side chains. 1. Quinoxaline N-oxides.
AB  - A series of penicillin derivatives of quinoxaline di-N-oxide carboxylic acids was prepared. These compounds were prepared from the acid chlorides and mixed anhydrides of the quinoxaline di-N-oxides. The compounds prepared exhibited minimal antibacterial activity against gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of resistance to gentamicin in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of the occurrence of resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria revealed a 3-fold increase in the percentage of resistant strains between 1974 (4%), and 1976 (12%). Gentamicin resistance was mainly found in isolates from hospitalized patients. Serratia (35--78%), Proteus inconstans (53--62%), Klebsiella (6--21%), Acinetobacter (9--17%) and Pseudomonas (9--14%) exhibited the highest percentage of resistance to this drug. Gentamicin inactivating enzymes were detected in 16 selected resistant isolates. Of these, ten strains (Klebsiella, Serratia, Pseudomonas, E. coli) produced the aminoglycoside 2''-adenylyltransferase, five (Proteus, indole-positive) the aminoglycoside 2'-N-acetyltransferase and one isolate (Proteus mirabilis) the aminoglycoside 3-N-acetyltransferase. Eight of the 16 strains were able to transfer gentamicin resistance and certain other resistance markers to appropriate receptor strains during mixed cultivation, indicating the presence of transferable plasmid-mediated resistance.
TI  - [Elder people in institutions - Problems concerning health and hygiene (author's  transl)].
AB  - On the basis of our earlier studies on the hygienic, health and social situation  of old people living in their own flats, we investigated the conditions in all 12 larger old people's homes of a big city in the Rhine-Main area, as well as 100 selected subjects of a defined socio-economic group within these homes. We checked the existence of pathogenic germs and the total number of germs on a total of 247 air culture plates in as many rooms and 669 impression preparations; additionally, we evaluated 35 examinations of members of the staff. We classified our findings according to the following typical areas: flats, recreation rooms, corridors, bathrooms, toilets, tea kitchens and main kitchens as well as washing and ironing rooms. - In all the homes we found with a single exception up to eight samples with Staphyl. aureus and, occasionally, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and other pathogens. A typical localisation for these groups was not found. In contrast, a clear "graduation" was found to exist with respect to the average figures of the colony size, with the kitchens and laundries revealing the best figures, the living and social rooms - these usually less frequently used - intermediate, and bathrooms, toilets and corridors, and especially the tea kitchens, the most unfavourable figures. In view of the disinfection measures which are often of a merely symbolic nature, carried out in old people's homes, our figures emphasize the necessity for intensive education and counselling. As regards personal hygiene and cleanliness, formerly acquired habits and patterns of behaviour were influenced by the home only insofar as help and surveillance eliminate all gross forms of deficient care. The establishment of clinical findings and the detailed questioning on anamnestic and social problems confirmed the significance of the multimorbidity and the degree of seriousness of the diseases to which the occupants of old people's homes are exposed despite good medical and nursing care.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of penicillins and cephalosporines in urine  (author's transl)].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for penicillin (PEN), ampicillin (AMP), cephalothin (CEF), cefazolin (CEZ), carbenicillin (CAR) and ticarcillin (TIC) were determined against Strep. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Prot. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa in Sensitivity Test Broth (STB) and human urine. Marked differences were seen in MIC between these two media, especially against P. mirabilis strains tested. Against E. coli the MIC of AMP, CEF and CEZ were similar or slightly lower in urine than in STB. MIC for CAR against E. coli were higher in urine. Against K. pneumoniae the MIC for CEF and CEZ were 2-4fold higher in urine than in STB. The activity of CAR and TIC against Ps. aeruginosa was lower in urine. Albeit high concentrations of antibiotics (up to 800fold) no inhibition was achieved in urine against P. mirabilis by AMP, CEF or CEZ. Only against Strep. faecalis all tested antibiotics had lower MIC in urine than in STB.
TI  - Microbiological studies on some bladder irrigation fluids.
AB  - A 1.5% glycine solution has recently been introduced as a bladder irrigation fluid. In this study, glycine solution was compared with two other recognised bladder irrigants (chlorhexidine and noxythiolin) for its inhibitory activity against common urinary tract pathogens. Glycine solution supported the growth of nearly 50% of the bacterial strains tested whereas chlorhexidine and noxythiolin were completely inhibitory. In quantitative studies with selected strains it was found that growth could be initiated from as few as 200 organisms/ml. It was concluded that glycine solution was capable of supporting bacterial growth and thus, from a microbiological viewpoint, was unsuitable as a bladder irrigant.
TI  - In vitro studies with sisomicin and gentamicin.
AB  - Sisomicin and gentamicin were tested in vitro against 222 clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria using the ICS agar dilution procedure. The two drugs were comparable in terms of overall activity although statistical analyses of the data revealed significant differences in their activity against several genera. Sisomicin was significantly more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.001), Proteus mirabilis (p less than 0.005), and Escherichia coli (p less than 0.01); gentamicin was significantly more active against Klebsiella (p less than 0.001). In most instances, 4.0 mug/ml of either drug was inhibitory for 90% or more of the isolates of each genus tested.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of antibiotics in human bile (author's transl)].
AB  - Marked differences exist between antibacterial activity in human bile and broth.  Whereas penicillins and cephalosporines exhibit virtually the same activity in broth and bile, tetracycline shows a great lose, and the activity of the aminoglykosides is increased in bile. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of chlorampenicol and co-trimoxazole are also different in broth and human bile. The differences in activity are related to the pH although not all deviations can be attributed to the effect of the pH. These results should be considered when treating gallbladder infections.
TI  - [The application of Actihaemyl in chronically inflamed and dystrophic urinary bladder (author's transl)].
AB  - The effect of automated continuous irrigation treatment with Actihaemyl on bacterial growth in the infected urinary bladder was tested using an experimental model. The result was that instillation alone of this preparation promoted growth of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the infected bladder. With simultaneous application of Framycetinsulfate or Kanamycin the growth of Pr. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa was totally suppressed in the "urine", and the growth of E. coli extensively low. At the same time there was a clear reduction in the bacterial count in the coagulum that served as a substitute bladder wall. Thus a urinary tract infection is a contraindication for local treatment with Actihaemyl of a tropically disturbed urinary bladder inasmuch as an effective antibiotic is not added to the instillate. With the latter combination, however, a therapeutic trial is justified in chronic, inflammatory, dystrophic bladders.
TI  - Chemistry and antibacterial activity of nitrobenzofurans.
AB  - Thirteen 2-methylbenzofurans were synthesized and their antibacterial activity was investigated. 2-Methyl-3-nitrobenzofuran and analogs containing 7-NO2, 5-NO2, 7-Br, 7-CONH2, and 7-CF3 substituents are bacteriostatic. The spectrum of activity of these compounds is similar to nitrofurazone; however, a strain of E. coli Br which has increased resistance to nitrofurazone did not show increased resistance to 3,7-dinitro-2-methylbenzofuran (1). The 3-nitro-2-methylbenzofurans are labile in solution (T1/2 0.8-3.5 hr at 37 degrees, pH 7.0). The solvolysis product of 1 was identified as alpha,6-dinitro-o-cresol (15). The 3-nitrobenzofurans are more potent in minimal media than in Penassay broth. This greater potency can be abolished by addition of casamino acids and tryptophan to the minimal media.

TI  - Nation-wide survey of antibiotic resistance by means of a computer: bacterial strains from the urine, stool, and upper respiratory tract.
AB  - All-nation data of antibiotic resistance of about 200 000 bacterial strains isolated in the Slovak Socialist Republic in 1973 have been grouped, and compared, by means of a computer, into resistances of strains isolated from the urine, from upper respiratory tract (URT), from stool and from other pathological materials. In general, urine strains of all species investigated were found to be more resistant to "main antibiotics", and, suprisingly, to septrin, than strains from other sources. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and, notably, of Klebsiella-Enterobacter from the URT are generally more susceptible to antibiotics than strains of these species isolated from other sources. Urine strains of E. coli, P. mirabilis and Ps. aeruginosa show a high degree of resistance almost to all antibiotics, with exception of gentamicin and colistin (for E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa only). Further antibiotics for combatting these strains are urgently needed. Similar computer-assisted monitoring of strains from the very specified sources may be easily adapted for individual hospitals, clinics and even wards.

AB  - We obtained throat cultures from 100 randomly selected people free from any chronic upper or lower respiratory disease who did not work in a hospital and who had not experienced any acute illness or received any antibacterial therapy in the 4 weeks preceding culture. Eighteen percent harbored either a species of Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their pharynx. In all cases, colony counts were low, the majority being detected in broth media selective for Gram-negative rods. There were no clear-cut age or sex distributions of Gram-negative pharyngeal carriage. These data imply that, in at least some cases, isolation of Gram-negative rods from sputum of untreated patients may be a normal finding, and that in some patients with pulmonary infection, the pretreatment, upper respiratory tract flora may serve as the source of subsequent superinfection with Gram-negative rods.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibiotic resistance by means of a computer. An introduction into the analysis of multiple antibiotic resistance.
AB  - One-year surveillance of single and multiple antibiotic resistance of 8 species of so-called "Problem Bacteria" by computer analysis of data obtained from 18 Public Health Laboratories in Slovakia in 1973 enables to establish the most frequently occuring spectra of multiple drug resistance which would point to the spread of typical R plasmids among the Problem bacteria investigated. As an introduction, we surveyed the mode of testing of Problem bacteria in individual PHLs against antibiotics - drugs of choice. Iw was important to find out whether strains belonging to Problem bacteria investigated are tested against sufficient number of antibacterial drugs. Our study shows that the percentage of bi- and multiple drug resistance in almost all bacterial species investigated depend on the number of antibiotics used in tests in vitro as single discs. The more antibiotic discs are used to test the strains, the more chance the laboratory has to register the true picture of multiresistance to antibiotics. Our study also shows that the testing in the PHLs associated to the computer study in this respect is inadequate. Moreover, the increasing complexity and proportion of multiple drug resistance in Problem Bacteria - with a notable exception of Salmonellae - forces the PHLs to use more and more discs so that using two Petri dishes full of discs - 12 to 15 discs - begins to be necessary in testing of most of the Problem bacteria under investigation.
TI  - Susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  - Combinations of either clindamycin or erythromycin with gentamicin, colimycin, or carbenicillin were studied for their antimicrobial effects on clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No antagonistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were observed. Synergistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were noted against most strains of E. coli tested, especially when either clindamycin or erythromycin was combined with gentamicin or colimycin. Of 16 other combinations of antibiotics examined with strains of E. coli as the test organisms, only the combination of penicillin G with either gentamicin or colimycin showed consistent synergy. The marked synergy of clindamycin combined with either gentamicin or colimycin was further demonstrated by following the kinetics of the bactericidal action of the antibiotic combinations and the effects on bacterial protein synthesis.
TI  - [The fundamental and clinical studies on PT-122M (doxycycline) in the otorhinolaryngological field (author's transl)].
AB  - As the results of laboratory and clinical investigation with a new tetracycline derivate, PT-122M (doxycycline) was performed with the results which may lead to the following conclusions. 1) In vitro antibacterial activity: The minimal inhibitory concentration of doxycycline (DOTC) was measured by an agar plate dilution method. The MIC of DOTC against 60 strains of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus isolated from otorrhoea was distributed over a range of 0.2 approximately 1.56 mcg/ml and 12.5 approximately 50 mcg/ml. Furthermore, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae was 3.13 to 100 mcg/ml. 2) Concentration in blood: The blood level of DOTC in healthy adults who were given 100 mg of DOTC intravenous reached maximum of 1.97 mcg/ml on the average 15 minutes after injection. Even at 12 hours after intravenous injection clinically effective serum DOTC concentration of 0.47 mcg/ml was still demonstrable. 3) CLINICAL RESULTS: PT-122M (DOCT) was intravenously injected into 30 cases with typical infection in the field of otorhinolaryngology. It was excellent in 15 cases, good in 10 cases, fair in 3 cases, and poor in 2 cases. When the cases in which it was excellent and good were considered together, good results were obtained in 25 cases, a ratio of effectiveness being 83 per cent. 4) Side effect: The comparative examination of hepatic function, electrolyte and auditory acuity before and after injection showed no significant disturbance. No side effect was shown with the intravenous injection.
TI  - Detection of endotoxins with the Limulus test in burned and unburned mice infected with different species of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The Limulus test detected endotoxins in the plasma of burned and unburned mice infected with different species of gram-negative bacteria produced different amounts of endotoxin in the plasma of infected mice. Plasma from mice given lethal infections showed very high concentrations of endotoxin. Low concentrations of endotoxin in the plasma were tolerated by mice but high concentrations were invariably fatal. A polyvalent pseudomonas vaccine reduced endotoxin in the plasma of mice given lethal infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  - Contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (STIC) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. Such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the STIC has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. Cultures of ENTEROBACTER, Klebsiella, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in the presence of human serum. The enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the STIC. Care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an STICassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. Serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.

Bacteriological swabs and sampling with broth were evaluated as methods of detecting contamination. Gross contamination was detected by broth sampling on occasions when swabbing failed to reveal contamination. The presence of up to 18% by volume of residual air within the apparatus was detected. A method of ensuring elimination of all air is described and studies showed that disinfection was then complete.
TI  - The varying sensitivity to antibacterial agents of micro-organisms in pure vs. mixed cultures.
AB  - In this study the disc sensitivities of five organisms growing in pure cultures (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans) were first determined against each of seven antibacterial agents (penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, silver nitrate, Sulfamylon, and Betadine). Then the sensitivity of each organism growing in combination with one of the others (10 combinations) was tested against each of the same antibacterials. Significantly increased and decreased sensitivities were found in 30 percent of the cultures with decreases largely predominating. Total obliteration of all sensitivity occurred 10 percent of the time. The changes in sensitivity were not distributed randomly but rather were associated more with particular agents and organisms. Sulfamylon, was associated with decreases 70 percent of the time with sensitivity obliteration in 50 percent of the tests. Streptococcus led all the organisms, being associated with decreases in half of the tests. It is possible that mixed-culture sensitivities could provide the most valid information when mixed infections exist, since they more closely simulate the real clinical situation. Therefore it is suggested that both mixed and pure culture sensitivity testing be done for all mixed infections.
TI  - Otitis externa in the dog -- a clinical and microbiological study.
AB  - The effect on canine otitis externa of a topical preparation composed of Fucidin, Framycetin, Nystatin, and Prednisolone was evaluated in a clinical trial comprising 235 dog ears. Cases caused by parasites or foreign bodies and cases requiring systemic therapy were excluded. Swabs from these and an additional 434 affected ears were examined bacteriologically and the sensitivity to antibiotics of the bacteria isolated determined. The infection most frequently diagnosed was staphylococci plus yeasts (29 % of total material) followed by pure yeast-infections (19 %) and pure staphylococcus infections (16 %). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Proteus mirabilis were found in 7 % of the ears, while no organisms could be isolated from 22 %. Sensitivity tests showed a satisfactory in vitro effect of Neomycin (Framycetin) on most of the bacteria commonly isolated, and a very good effect of Fucidin on the staphylococci. Approximately 91 % of the ears treated were clinically cured or improved very considerably; the relation between clinical response and type of infection is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. It was confirmed that infections with Ps. aeruginosa represent a special problem; the results of post-treatment sensitivity tests seem to suggest, however, that a longer or more intense course of treatment than the one used in the trial (two weeks) would provide the answer to this.

TI  - The use of analytical isoelectric focusing for detection and identification of beta-lactamases.
AB  - BETA-Lactamases (EC. 3.5.2.6) from strains of Gram-negative bacteria have been studied using analytical isoelectric focusing. This permits a visual comparison of the patterns of beta-lactamase bands produced by enzymes from different organisms. Purification of crude intracellular preparations is unnecessary and the technique is sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate beta-lactamase in mutants previously reported to lack the enzyme. R that have not been distinguished from one another biochemically or immunologically can be differentiated by isoelectric focusing. Conversely, the enzymes specified by the R factors RTEM, R1 and RGN14, with identical isoelectric focusing patterns have the same biochemical properties. Chromosomal and R-factor-mediated beta-lactamases from single strains have been separated and their identities confirmed by immunoisoelectric focusing. R factor-mediated enzymes gave identical isoelectric focusing patterns irrespective of the host strain. Isoelectric focusing can therefore be used to observe the transfer of beta-lactamases carried by R factors.
TI  - Comparison of the germicidal activity of prepodyne and betadine surgical scrub solutions.
AB  - Two iodophoric surgical scrubs soaps, Prepodyne and Betadine, were evaluated for  bacteriocidal activity in a modified phenol coefficient test. A standard inoculum of each of 18 species of microorganisms was mixed with a 1:8 dilution of each iodophor and subcultured after one, three, and five minutes of exposure. Complete cidal activty was exhibited by both Prepodyne and Betadine. Twenty-five subjects were tested in hand washing experiments using Betadine and Prepodyne surgical scrub solutions. Quantitative fingerprint cultures were obtained before and after hand washing. Betadine resulted in an 85.2 per cent plus or minus 24 per cent decrease; Prepodyne, and 83.6 per cent plus or minus 21 per cent decrease. It can'be concluded from this data that there is no difference in bacteriocidal effectiveness between the two scrub soaps.
TI  - Effectiveness of achievable urinary concentrations of tetracyclines against "tetracycline-resistant" pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Hospitalized patients with urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other bacterial pathogens are frequently treated with parenteral antibiotics such as gentamicin. Many of these organisms are shown by Kirby-Bauer disk sensitivity testing to be resistant to tetracycline. One hundred seventy-one such tetracycline-resistant bacterial isolates were studied; 84% were found to be sensitive to achievable urinary concentrations of tetracycline. Two patients with long-standing chronic urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas were treated with tetracycline for a year and a half with excellent results. In a pilot clinical trial, eight of 12 hospitalized patients with urinary tract infection were treated successfully with tetracycline without regard to disk sensitivity data. Institution of tetracycline as soon as the microscopic diagnosis of urinary tract infection is made might be an acceptable empiric approach to the treatment of urinary infection in hospitalized patients who do not show evidence of sepsis.
TI  - Herd studies on coliform mastitis.
AB  - Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 63, 10, and 11 percent, respectively, of 158 coliform organisms recovered from mastitis cases in 8 California herds. The severity and nature of the coliform mastitis problem were found to vary greatly among herds but were characteristic for each of 4 herds studied in detail.
TI  - Rapid detection and identification of enteric bacteria from blood cultures.

Excellent correlation was obtained between the Inolex card and routine identification techniques when organisms from both artificially inoculated and clinical blood cultures were studied. In many instances, the culture report was available less than 24 hr after receipt of the specimen.
TI  - [Experimental investigations concerning spectrum, serum concentration, and excretion of Spectacillin (author's transl)].
AB  - By means of the diffusion test, the range of action of the ampicillin successive  preparation spectacillin was determined using 12 000 pathological germs freshly isolated from in-patients. The result was a range of action similar to that of ampicillin. A comparison, however, is only possible in case the test platelets (without over-dosage) are each charged with exactly, e.g., 25 gamma. The analyses of serum concentrations have shown that spectacillin is satisfactorily absorbed after oral as well as after parenteral application. Thus, the calculation of the accumulated area of infinity beneath the serum concentration curve had the following results: After single intravenous injection of 1 g spectacillin (n equals 12) 51.46 gamma/ml - h; after single intravenous injection of 2 g spectacillin 86.20 gamma/ml - h; after intramuscular injection (twice) - interval of 12 hours - 29.94 gamma/ml - h after 12 hours; same values as before, but after 24 hours, 29.37 gamma/ml - h. After a single oral application of one capsule of spectacillin (capsule equals 500 mg), the value of the accumulated area was 8.46 gamma/ml - h. In analogy of the good absorption, excretion in urine/24 hrs (after application of 1 g spectacillin intravenously) was 61.74 p.c., after 2 g i.v. 54.30 p.c., and after applying twice 1 g spectacillin intramuscularly 61.40 p.c.; after oral application of 500 mg, the percentage was 28.42. Tolerance of spectacillin was good after oral as well as after parenteral application. No side effects were observed.
TI  - Chemotherapeutic nitroheterocycles. 18. 2-(5-Nitro-2-imidazolylmethylene)-1-indanones, -1-tetralones, and -acetophenones substituted by aminoalkoxy groups.
AB  - 2-(5-Nitro-2-imidazolylmethylene)-1-indanones, -1-tetralones, and -acetophenones  substituted by aminoalkoxy groups and related compounds (41-69, table ii) were synthesized and their antimicrobial activities were evaluated (table iii). Some of these compounds (e.g. 47, 52, and 59) suprisingly exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum including Proteus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Extraordinary antitrichomonal activities could also be observed in vitro (MIC of compound 59, 0.0004 pg/ml) and six of the title compounds (48, 49, 52, 58, 64, 66) displayed in vivo activity in mice against Trichomonas vaginalis comparable to that of metronidazole (70).
TI  - Activity of three aminoglycosides and two penicillins against four species of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Three aminoglycoside antibiotics and two penicillins were compared for their in vitro activity against 60 isolates of Serratia, Pseudomonas, Proteus mirabilis, and indole-positive Proteus sp. Testing was done by the agar dilution method using Mueller-Hinton broth solidified with 1.5% agar. The activity of amikacin, aminodeoxybutirosin, and gentamicin against Proteus and Pseudomonas, as related to their peak blood levels, showed no significant differences. Amikacin was the most active against Serratia marcescens. Results using Mueller-Hinton media in broth dilution tests correlated with the agar dilution method except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimal inhibitory concentration for aminoglycosides in agar was considerably greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration in Mueller-Hinton broth, and the disparity was related to the higher divalent cation concentration of agar. BL-P1654 and carbenicillin were similar except that carbenicillin was much more active against indole-positive Proteus sp. Additionally, the ratio of bactericidal to bacteriostatic concentrations of BL-P1654 was considerably greater than for carbenicillin.
TI  - In-vitro effect of edta-tris-lysozyme solutions on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro effect of EDTA-Tris-lysozyme solution on 16 pathogenic bacteria of medical or veterinary importance was determined. Marked decreases in bacterial count occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Moraxella osloensis and Campylobacter fetus, and smaller decreses with Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella boydii, Aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Erysipelothrix insidiosa. The test solution had no effect on Klebsiella ozaenae, Brucella canis, Cornynebacterium pyogenes, Coryne, renale, Streptococcus equi and staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Computer surveillance of shifts in the gross patient flora during hospitalization.
AB  - Data accumulating routinely in a hospital microbiology laboratory were computer-plotted according to the number of days the patient had been in the hospital when each culture was obtained. The rate at which patients were cultured fell slightly during hospitalization, while the rate at which isolates were obtained from them increased gradually. For some species, such as Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus, isolation rates changed little during hospitalization. They rose as much as sevenfold for other species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Serratia marcescens, or for a particular antibiotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae while it was an endemic nosocomial problem. These differences persisted after deletion of repeat isolates from the same patient. They appeared to reflect general shifts in composition of patient flora during hospitalization. These shifts paralleled shifts in infecting flora as represented by similar plots of isolates from blood cultures.
TI  - The role of vaginal colonization with enterobacteriaceae in recurrent urinary infections.
AB  - Quantitative cultures of the vaginal introitus for Enterobacteriaceae, S. faecalis and P. aeruginosa were compared in 20 premenopausal normal women (200 cultures) to 198 consecutive cultures from 9 premenopausal women in between episodes of bacteriuria. Introital colonization in patients susceptible to urinary infections was significantly higher for E. coli (p equals 0.001), S. faecalis (p equals 0.001) and for the presence of any gram-negative pathogens (p equals less than 0.001). In addition, introital colonization with these bacteria occurred in larger numbers and persisted through consecutive cultures for longer periods in women with recurrent infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of sisomicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, against clinical isolates.
AB  - Sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by Micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. With the exception of Serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. Sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp. It was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. Isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. Most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.
TI  - [A bacteriological study of otitis in dogs (author's transl)].
AB  - Bacteriological examination of 100 cases of otitis in dogs revealed pure cultures of different microorganisms as follows: Staphylococcus aureus from 25 animals; Escherichia coli from 10; Proteus mirabilis from 20; Enterobacter sp. from 18 and Klepsiella sp. from 7. Mixed cultures of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klepsiella sp. were found in 3 animals; Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter sp. in 5; Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis in 4. Enterobacter sp. and Klepsiella sp. in 2 and Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli in 6. Theses results indicated that Staphylococcus aureus appeared as the most frequent microorganism (36%) followed by Proteus mirabilis (23%) and Klepsiella sp. (16%). Drug resistance studies showed that all tested strains were resistant to the antibiotics and to the nalidixic acid in levels higher than 20microgram/ml except gentamycin which showed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa a resistance level for 10microgram/ml.
TI  - Nation-wide survey of antibiotic resistance by means of a computer. Analysis of 200.000 strains of problem bacteria isolated in 1973.
AB  - Based on a pilot study performed in 5 District Public Health Laboratories (PHL) in the Slovakia in 1972 (1), the computer system for elaborating the informations concerning the resistance of "problem bacteria" to antibiotics has completely been introduced in 18 PHLs for all-year studies on the resistance to antibiotics in 1973. The results obtained in each PHL and also in total of about 200.000 bacterial strains belonging to 8 of the clinically most important bacterial species were passed on to the corresponding PHL and to the health authorities twice a year. Each PHL elaborated these data being useful and instructive for general practitioners and clinicians in the hospitals of their districts to a commented information on the actual state of effectiveness of individual antibacterial drugs. The multiple spectra of resistance to antibiotics indicating the occurrence of R plasmids in clinical isolates of bacteria and the dynamics for the development of resistance against certain specially monitored "reserved antibiotics" are elaborated at present and will be published in a subsequent communication...
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activities of BB-K8 and three other aminoglycosides against 215 strains of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae with variable sensitivity to kanamycin and gentamicin.
AB  - 215 gram-negative bacilli isolated from clinical materials were tested in vitro against BB-K8 by means of disc diffusion and agar dilution tests; the strains included 40 isolates resistant to gentamicin. Approximately 90% of the strains were inhibited by 3.12 mug/ml or less BB-K8. This antibiotic exhibited a comparable activity, although somewhat inferior, to that of gentamicin, against organisms sensitive to gentamicin. It was considrably more active than gentamicin, and comparable to tobramycin, against the isolates of Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia spp. resistant to gentamicin, but less active than tobramycin against 11 strains of Pseudomonas resistant to gentamicin.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa R factors determining gentamicin plus carbenicillin resistance from patients with urinary tract colonizations.
AB  - R factors determining multiple resistance including both gentamicin and carbenicillin have been identified in high incidence among hospital isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The factors are readily transmitted to other P. aeruginosa but not to Escherichia coli strains K-12 or C, or to Proteus mirabilis. R factor-containing isolates are predominantly immunotype 7 isolated from urinary sources.
TI  - Evaluation of different antibiotic actions combined with rifampicin. In vitro synergism against Pseudomonas and Proteus.
AB  - Associations of penicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline and polymyxin B with rifampicin were tested for synergism against Pseudomonas and Proteus pathological strains. The combination of rifampicin and polymyxin B was clearly synergistic for all strains as it was evaluated by isobolograms and killing curvesmthe bactericidal action of this association, without any cross-resistance between its components, may eradicate gram-negative bacteria infections with marked polyvalent drug resistances.

TI  - In vitro studies with cefazolin.
AB  - Susceptibilities of 259 isolates of pathogenic bacteria to cefazolin were measured by broth and agar dilution procedures. Beta-hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 0.25 mug/ml, whereas Staphylococcus aureus and alphahemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 2.0 mug/ml. Enterococci were resistant to less than 32 mug/ml. Wide variation was seen with gram-negative species. Most isolates of Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis were inhibited by 4.0 or 8.0 mug/ml. Escherichia coli were less susceptible, and most isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia species, and Enterobacter species were resistant to 128 mug/ml.
TI  - Properties of R factors from Bordetella bronchiseptica.
AB  - Genetic properties and host ranges of R factors derived from Bordetella bronchiseptica of pig origin were examined. All of 61 R factors tested could confer resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and aminobenzyl penicillin on their host bacteria. All of them were identified as fi(-) (no fertility inhibition) type and were found to exhibit no restriction of phages lambda, phi80, P1, P2, T1, T3, T6, T7, W31, and BF-23. They could confer macarbomysin susceptibility on their host cells when infected. An Rte16, a representative R factor, was incompatible with both RP4 and R40a, which are classified as compatibility groups P and C, respectively. An Rte16 was conjugally transmissible to B. bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, but not to Shigella flexneri, S. sonnei, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Existence of a free form of a specific membrane lipoprotein in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The existence of a free form of a specific lipoprotein of molecular weight 7,200  was examined in the envelopes of several gram-negative bacteria. When the envelope proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, distinct peaks were observed in Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the same position as the free form of the lipoprotein of Escherichia coli. However, the peak was not observed in Proteus mirabilis. The protein at the peak in S. typhimurium was shown to contain little or no histidine as expected from the amino acid composition of the lipoprotein. Furthermore, antiserum against the highly purified lipoprotein from E. coli was shown to react with the proteins from S. typhimurium and S. marcescens and to form the specific immunoprecipitates. In contrast, the protein from P. aeruginosa did not react with the antiserum at all. Thus, it is concluded that S. typhimurium and S. marcescens have the free form of the lipoprotein in their envelopes as does E. coli. P. aeruginosa contains a protein of the same size as the lipoprotein, but it is not certain whether the protein is the same structural protein as the lipoprotein from E. coli. P. mirabilis may not have any free form of the lipoprotein, may have it in a very small amount, or may have a lipoprotein of different molecular weight serving the same function.
TI  - Genetic and biophysical study of R plasmids conferring sulfonamide resistance in  Shigella strains isolated in 1952 and 1956.
AB  - The conjugative plasmids determining sulfonamide resistance in five Shigella strains, each isolated from a different patient, have been characterized. One S. flexneri 2a strain, isolated in 1952, harbored an fi(+) plasmid of molecular weight 53 x 10(6), which specified synthesis of F-like pili and bore determinants for sulfonamide resistance (Su) and bacteriocinogeny (Col). This plasmid was compatible with plasmids of groups F(I), F(II), I(alpha), and P. A second S. flexneri 2a strain isolated in 1952 harbored an fi(-) plasmid of molecular weight 59 x 10(6), bearing the Su determinant and compatible with all plasmids tested. This strain also harbored an fi(+) group-F(II) plasmid of molecular weight 42 x 10(6), which bore the Col determinant and specified synthesis of F-like pili. Three S. dysenteriae 2 strains isolated in 1956 carried apparently identical fi(-) plasmids of molecular weight 58 x 10(6), which bore the Su determinant, could form transconjugants in Pseudomonas but not in Proteus, and were incompatible with the P-group plasmid RP4.

TI  - Characteristics of PRD1, a plasmid-dependent broad host range DNA bacteriophage.
AB  - Several distinctive properties of PRD1, an icosahedral plasmid-dependent phage, are described. The drug-resistance plasmid-dependent host range of PRD1 extends beyond the P incompatibility group and includes gram-negative bacteria containing plasmids of incompatibility groups N and W. PRD1 phage will infect pseudomonads and Enterobacteriaceae containing either a P or W incompatibility group plasmid. PRD1 adsorbs to the cell wall of R(+) bacteria and thus its infectivity indicates cell wall alterations by these drug-resistance plasmid groups. PRD1 nucleic acid is duplex DNA with an estimated molecular weight of 24 x 10(6). The appearance of PRD1 in electron micrographs is suggestive of lipid content in addition to its buoyant density of 1.348 in CsCl and its sensitivity to chloroform. The latent period of PRD1 varies with the R(+) host bacterial strain used for growth of the phage.
TI  - Cefoxitin, a semisynthetic cephamycin antibiotic: antibacterial spectrum and resistance to hydrolysis by gram-negative beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefoxitin, 3-carbamolyloxymethyl-7-alpha-methoxy-7[2-(2-thienyl)acetamido]-3-cephem-4-carboy xlic acid, was investigated. Activity against gram-positive organisms was less than that of cephalothin and cephloridine. It was highly active against gram-negative bacilli, with activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae equal to that of currently available cephalosporins. In addition, it was active against certain Enterobacter strains, Serratia marcescens, indole-positive Proteae and Herellea. The strains of these latter bacteria were strains susceptible to carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were resistant. Changes in pH, inoculum size, and type of growth medium had no significant effect on the activity of the antibiotic. Cefoxitin was highly resistant to hydrolysis by various types of gram-negative beta-lactamases. The precise role of resistance to beta-lactamase hydrolysis varied from strain to strain. Bacterial resistance to cefoxitin was not necessarily related to hydrolysis of the antibiotic. However, the resistance of cefoxitin to hydrolysis did contribute to its activity. Cefoxitin could function as an inducer of beta-lactamase activity and effectively bound to purified beta-lactamases.

TI  - Experience in monitoring gentamicin therapy during treatment of serious gram-negative sepsis.
AB  - This paper reports our experience in monitoring gentamicin therapy during the treatment of 68 episodes of serious Gram-negative sepsis in 65 hospital patients. Most of the patients had major underlying disease. Of those who were adequately treated (peak serum concentrations of 5 mug/ml or more in 72 hours for septicaemia, urinary tract infection, and wound infection; and 8 mug/ml or more at some time during the course of treatment for pneumonia) 84% (46 out of 55) were cured. These serum concentrations could be achieved only by starting with a regimen of 5 mg/kg/day in three divided doses in all adult patients, subsequent dosage being determined by the results of rapid serum assay. The incidence of nephrotoxicity and symptomatic ototoxicity was no greater than in previous series. The main reason for assaying serum gentamicin is to ensure that an adequate dosage is achieved as soon as possible. In patients with impaired renal function or receiving prolonged high dosage assays also serve to guard against an excessive accumulation of gentamicin and an increased risk of toxicity.

TI  - Effect of colon flora and short-chain fatty acids on growth in vitro of Pseudomonas aeruginsoa and Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Heat-stable antibacterial activity in the following suspensions was demonstrated  against Pseudomonas aeruginosa at pH 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5: (i) pooled colon contents of normal mice; (ii) an anaerobic, 48-h culture of normal mouse feces; and (iii) anaerobic, 48-h cultures of different bacteria from human colon flora (Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis). The lower the pH of the medium, the greater was the antibacterial activity of these suspensions. The antibacterial activity of five fatty acids (propionic, butyric, isobutyric, acetic, and formic acids) was greater against P. aeruginosa than against three Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis) at all fatty acid concentrations (0.16 M to 0.005 M) and at the 3 pH values studied (5.5, 6.0, and 6.5). As the pH value increased, the antibacterial activity decreased. Antibacterial activity was greater at higher fatty acid concentrations, and at each pH value it was greatest for the fatty acids having high pK(a) values. Lactic acid, with the lowest pK(a), exhibited little or no antibacterial activity. Acetic and butyric acids, two of the three predominant volatile fatty acids determined by gas chromatography in the mouse colon contents and in the anaerobic culture of mouse feces, occurred in vivo in concentrations which inhibited growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro at the pH of the mouse cecum. These results suggest that undissociated short-chain fatty acids produced by the colon flora may be a mechanism of intestinal resistance to colonization by P. aeruginosa.

AB  - IgG with antibacterial antibody opsonic activity was isolated from rabbit antisera produced by intravenous hyperimmunization with several test strains of pneumococci, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Antibody-enzyme conjugates were prepared, using diethylmalonimidate to couple glucose oxidase to IgG antibacterial antibody preparations. Opsonic human IgG obtained from serum of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis was also conjugated to glucose oxidase. Antibody-enzyme conjugates retained combining specificity for test bacteria as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. In vitro test for bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates utilized potassium iodide, lactoperoxidase, and glucose as cofactors. Under these conditions glucose oxidase conjugated to antibody generates hydrogen peroxide, and lactoperoxidase enzyme catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide with simultaneous oxidation of I(-) and halogenation and killing of test bacteria. Potent in vitro bactericidal activity of this system was repeatedly demonstrated for antibody-enzyme conjugates against pneumococci, streptococci, S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and E. coli. However, no bactericidal effect was demonstrable with antibody-enzyme conjugates and two test strains of P. aeruginosa. Bactericidal activity of antibody-enzyme conjugates appeared to parallel original opsonic potency of unconjugated IgG preparations. Antibody-enzyme conjugates at concentrations as low as 0.01 mg/ml were capable of intense bactericidal activity producing substantial drops in surviving bacterial counts within 30-60 min after initiation of assay. These in vitro bactericidal systems indicate that the concept of antibacterial antibody-enzyme conjugates may possibly be adaptable as a mechanism for treatment of patients with leukocyte dysfunction or fulminant bacteremia.
TI  - Elevated temperature technique for the isolation of salmonellas from sewage and human faeces.
AB  - Modified Moore's swabs, placed in sewers for 5 days, were used to concentrate salmonellas from sewage. Duplicate cultures of swab strips in selenite broth were incubated at 41 and 37 degrees C. respectively. Salmonella organisms were recovered consistently from the swabs when the enrichment broths were incubated at 41 degrees C. However, when equal portions of the same swabs were incubated at 37 degrees C., only 22% of them yielded Salmonella organisms. These results indicate an advantage in incubating the selenite broths at 41 degrees C. rather than 37 degrees C. in attempting to isolate salmonellas from sewage.One hundred and fifty faecal samples were examined for salmonellas by culture in selenite broths incubated at 41 and 37 degrees C. Twelve (8%) samples were positive at 41 degrees C. compared to only 10 (6.7%) positive samples at 37 degrees C. This difference is not statistically significant to indicate an advantage of the elevated-temperature of incubation over the conventional temperature in attempting to isolate salmonellas from human faeces. Moreover, results of the recovery rates of S. paratyphi B, S. typhi, and S. typhimurium indicate that an incubation temperature of 37 degrees C. is more appropriate for recovering salmonellas from artificially infected faecal samples than an incubation temperature of 41 degrees C. This stresses the inability of laboratory studies to mimic conditions in nature.

AB  - Amoxicillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzyl penicillin, BRL 2333) is a new semisynthetic penicillin which is structurally similar to ampicillin, but which is better absorbed and yields higher concentrations in serum and urine. The in vitro susceptibility of 145 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 30 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined against various concentrations of amoxicillin and ampicillin in agar. In addition, inhibitory zones around discs containing 10 mug of amoxicillin were measured and compared with results of agar dilution studies. The drug also was evaluated in the treatment of 38 patients with bacteriuria, who received doses of either 750 mg or 1 g/day for 10 days. In vitro, amoxicillin was comparable in activity to ampicillin; most isolates of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis were inhibited by 10 mug or less/ml, whereas the majority of strains of Enterobacter, Klebsiella, indole-positive Proteus species, and Pseudomonas grew in concentrations greater than 50 mug/ml. Clinically, amoxicillin was effective in eradicating bacteriuria due to susceptible organisms and was very well tolerated. For practical purposes, however, amoxicillin performed no better than a host of other drugs presently available for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated bacteriuria.

AB  - A penetration barrier operating outside the periplasmic enzyme penicillinase was  studied in an ampicillin-resistant mutant of Escherichia coli K-12. Growth in the presence of lysozyme and sublethal concentrations of ampicillin partially opened the barrier. This could be recorded as an increased penetration of penicillin G, sodium cholate, and rifampin to their respective targets. Brief treatments with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium cholate effectively impaired the barrier against penicillin and also caused leakage of penicillinase. Wild-type E. coli K-12, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa also showed an increased sensitivity to cholate after treatment with penicillins. Electron micrographs showed that lysis by cholate was due to a distortion of the cytoplasmic membrane causing a leakage of protein and RNA from the cells to the medium. Physiological data indicated that the increased sensitivity to cholate induced by growth in the presence of ampicillin or lysozyme was due to effects upon the murein. This was supported by measurement of the incorporation of (3)H-diaminopimelic acid. These results indicate that the murein sacculus either is a part of the penetration barrier or is responsible for holding the structure of the outer membrane together.

AB  - RP4, an R factor derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa S8 and specifying resistance to carbenicillin, neomycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline, could be isolated as an extrachromosomal satellite of covalently closed circular DNA (CCC-DNA) of molecular weight about 62 million and of buoyant density 1.719 g/cm(3) (60% guanine plus cytosine). When RP4 was compared by hybridization with RP1, an R factor originating in another strain of P. aeruginosa, it was shown that RP4 contains most, if not all, of the base sequences of RP1, and also additional sequences not found in RP1.

TI  - Activity of methacycline, related tetracyclines, and other antibiotics against various L-forms and their parent bacteria in vitro.
AB  - The activity of methacycline against microbial L-forms and their parent bacteria  was compared with that of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline, as well as with that of 22 other antibiotics which included examples of major groups of antibiotics. The L-forms and bacteria used were Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. faecalis var. zymogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (three strains), Proteus mirabilis (two strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli (two strains), Sarcina flava, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The five tetracyclines had similar activities and were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms, except that the bacterial form of S. flava was more susceptible than the L-form. In general, other antibiotics (except the penicillins) were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms. There were certain exceptions where the bacterial form was more susceptible than the L-form. These included the effect of polymyxin B and colistin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and P. mirabilis, and the effect of gentamicin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. flava, and S. marcescens.
TI  - Immunological response of mice to members of the autochthonous intestinal microflora.
AB  - Based on agglutination, complement fixation, bactericidal, and opsonization tests, it is evident that suspensions of a Bacteroides sp. isolated from the mouse intestine and given by parenteral routes do not initiate antibody formation in mice. Rats also respond poorly to the antigenic stimulus. In contrast, suspensions of other bacterial species isolated from the rodent intestine are highly immunogenic. Furthermore, high titers of antibody are produced in rabbits, guinea pigs, and sheep after parenteral injection of the Bacteroides suspensions. Marked differences in the absolute and relative numbers of Bacteroides in the intestinal contents of rodents and the latter three animal species have been demonstrated. It is proposed that the immunological unresponsiveness of rodents to this organism is related to its existence as a member of the autochthonous microflora in these animals.

TI  - Butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  - Butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of tobramycin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic.
AB  - One hundred fifty-two strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, and Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 mug of tobramycin/ml in a broth-dilution method and showed zones of inhibition of 16 mm or more around a 10-mug tobramycin disc in the Kirby-Bauer method. Tobramycin was most active against S. aureus, 100% of strains being inhibited by 0.1 mug/ml. All strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and indole-positive Proteus species, and 80% of Enterobacter species were inhibited by 0.8 mug of tobramycin/ml, whereas only 48% of P. mirabilis strains were inhibited by this concentration. Tobramycin was approximately twice as active as gentamicin against S. aureus, four times as active against P. aeruginosa, slightly more active against E. coli and Enterobacter species, equally active against P. mirabilis, and slightly less active against K. pneumoniae. The minimal bactericidal concentrations of tobramycin and gentamicin were the same as or twice the minimal inhibitory concentrations for all strains except those of P. aeruginosa, against which greater concentrations of both gentamicin and tobramycin were required for bactericidal activity. Tobramycin sterilized cultures of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa, but the rate of bactericidal action was faster with a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin than with either antibiotic alone in the same concentrations. Tobramycin retained potency in the presence of 200 to 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml for at least 6 hr of incubation at 37 C, but lost potency in the presence of 600 mug of carbenicillin/ml by 24 hr of incubation and in the presence of 800 mug/ml by 2 hr of incubation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of nifuratel in urine and serum.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations of nifuratel for 205 randomly selected isolates from urinary tract infections were tested by tube dilution. Of these, 177 (86.3%) were resistant to more than 6 mug/ml and 140 of 141 (99.3%) strains of Escherichia coli were resistant to more than 3 mug/ml. Urine levels of nifuratel were examined in two groups: one group had 400 mg given once and the other group had 2 g given over 24 hours. In both groups samples of urine were collected every hour for seven hours after the last dose. After one 400-mg dose the maximum urine level achieved by any subject was 2.0 mug/ml and the mean maximum level was 0.75 mug/ml. With the 2 g total dose, the maximum level noted was 4 mug/ml and the mean maximum level was 1.8 mug/ml. No measurable inhibition was noted in any of the blood samples removed at one and a half to two hours after the last dose.
TI  - Properties of a R factor which originated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1822.
AB  - RP1, a group of genes specifying resistance to carbenicillin, neomycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline and originating in a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was freely transmissible between strains of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis. Acquisition of the multiple drug resistance specified by RP1 by these strains was accompanied by acquisition of an extrachromosomal satellite of covalently closed circular deoxyribonucleic acid of molecular weight about 40 million daltons and of buoyant density 1.719 g/cm(3) (60% guanine plus cytosine).
TI  - Evaluation of a new cephalosporin antibiotic, cephapirin.
AB  - Cephapirin sodium, a parenterally administered derivative of cephalosporanic acid, was tested in vitro against 150 stock cultures of Enterobacteriaceae and 30 stock cultures each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Both broth- and agar-dilution techniques were employed with two sizes of inocula of organisms. At a concentration of 7.5 mug or less/ml, cephapirin inhibited and killed 100% of strains of Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis and more than 80% of Klebsiella species when tested against an inoculum of 10(5) bacterial cells/ml. However, even at 100 mug/ml, only a few isolates of other Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas were inhibited. A 100-fold increase in the inoculum resulted in decreased susceptibility of organisms. All penicillin-susceptible as well as penicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were inhibited and killed by 5 mug or less of cephapirin/ml when tested with an inoculum of either 10(4) or 10(6) organisms/ml. The drug also was studied in various doses in the treatment of 77 patients with diverse infections. Cephapirin was effective in the treatment of 27 of 32 patients with pulmonary infection, as well as in 6 of 7 patients with staphylococcal or streptococcal soft tissue infection. Of 25 patients with urinary-tract infections, 19 developed a negative culture during therapy. A single 4-g intramuscular dose of cephapirin was effective in only 2 of 11 patients with gonococcal urethritis or endocervicitis. Two patients with gonococcal urethritis treated with multiple injections were cured. The drug was well tolerated except for pain at the site of injection in 14 patients and phlebitis in 4 patients. No abnormalities in renal or hepatic function could be attributed to cephapirin. In addition, no abnormalities were found in the renal tubules of rabbits challenged with 500 mg of cephapirin/kg. If further studies document that cephapirin is well tolerated by the parenteral route, it may have advantages over cephalothin or cephaloridine.

TI  - Changes in antibiotic sensitivity patterns of Gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  - Sensitivity tests with 12 antibiotics on 1,018 strains of Gram-negative bacilli isolated in a burns unit between 1969 and 1971 showed some important differences from results in similar tests on a series of strains isolated between 1965 and 1967. These changes included the emergence of a large proportion of kanamycin-resistant strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli and of smaller proportions of trimethoprim- and gentamicin-resistant strains; also the complete replacement of Proteus mirabilis with dissociated resistance to ampicillin by strains showing linked resistance to ampicillin and carbenicillin. The probable relationship of these changes to the emergence of an R factor determining resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, carbenicillin, ampicillin, and cephaloridine in Enterobacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is discussed.

TI  - Media exchange method for demonstrating killing of L-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  - Normal human serum has been shown to kill L-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. Previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. This failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and NaCl. A method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some L-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. Using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the L-phase variants of Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi. This method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for L-phase variants.
TI  - Epicillin: experimental chemotherapy, pharmacodynamics, and susceptibility testing.
AB  - Epicillin exhibits excellent therapeutic activity when administered orally or subcutaneously to mice infected with a variety of pathogenic bacteria. These included single strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, non-penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strains of microorganisms selected as typical of those that frequently cause serious clinical infections. In oral chemotherapeutic comparisons of tetracycline, chloramphenicol, cephalexin, ampicillin, and epicillin, the latter, with but minor exceptions, exhibited activity comparable to that of most of the other antibiotics studied. Oral administration to mice of a loading dose of epicillin or ampicillin resulted in similar peak blood levels and decay curves. The concentration in urine and the excretion rates were significantly higher in epicillin than in ampicillin-treated animals. Presumptive evidence suggests that the inter-pretation of zone diameters obtained with 10-mug epicillin discs should be the same as is used for 10-mug ampicillin discs.
TI  - Semisynthetic penicillin 6-(D(--)-alpha-carboxy-3-thienylacetamido) penicillanic  acid active against Pseudomonas in vitro.
AB  - The activity of 6-[d(-)-alpha-carboxy-3-thienylacetamido] penicillanic acid, BRL2288, was determined against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and various gram-negative bacilli. The majority of Pseudomonas strains (89%) were inhibited by 100 mug of the antibiotic per ml. BRL2288 is twofold more active than carbenicillin against Pseudomonas at 100 mug/ml or less. Among Enterobacteriaceae tested, 87% Enterobacter and 87% of Proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug/ml or less. Indole-positive Proteus were inhibited by 10 mug/ml or less. Fifty-five per cent of ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli were inhibited by 100 mug/ml. Klebsiella were uniformly resistant. BRL2288 is not hydrolyzed by most resistant Pseudomonas, but it is destroyed by the beta-lactamases of E. coli and P. mirabilis. The antibiotic shows synergy with gentamicin but not with penicillinase-resistant penicillins such as cloxacillin. Activity of BRL2288 against gram-positive organisms is two- to eightfold less than that of ampicillin or benzylpenicillin G.
TI  - Effect of pH on the activity of erythromycin against 500 isolates of gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Erythromycin was found to be a more effective inhibitor of gram-negative bacilli  in alkaline medium than in neutral or acid medium. A definite effect was noted with all of 500 recent clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis studied, but it was most striking with E. coli. At pH 8.5 all strains, except for 14% of those of P. mirabilis, were inhibited by concentrations of erythromycin readily achieved in urine with common therapeutic doses.
TI  - Effect of mg and ethylenediaminetetraacetate on the in vitro activity of coumermycin a(1) and novobiocin against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effect of Mg(2+) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on the in vitro activity of coumermycin A(1) and novobiocin was determined against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis grown in Trypticase Soy Broth or defined synthetic medium. In the presence of EDTA, the activity of coumermycin A(1) was significantly enhanced (8- to 40-fold) against all four organisms in the synthetic medium lacking Mg(2+); novobiocin activity was increased to a lesser extent (4- to 16-fold) against three strains and remained unchanged against P. mirabilis. Addition of 200 mug of Mg(2+) per ml to the synthetic medium containing EDTA completely reversed the enhancement of activity of both antibiotics by EDTA only against P. aeruginosa. The addition of Mg(2+) to the synthetic medium appreciably inhibited the activity of novobiocin (sixfold) but not coumermycin A(1) against E. coli, and had little or no effect on the activity of either antibiotic against the remaining organisms. K. pneumoniae showed the greatest susceptibility to both antibiotics, and addition of EDTA enhanced this activity from 4-fold to 20-fold in all of the media tested. Subinhibitory concentrations of both antibiotics induced filament formation by all four organisms in all media. In addition, lysis of K. pneumoniae cells was observed.
TI  - Prevention of experimental hematogenous and retrograde pyelonephritis by antibodies against enterobacterial common antigen.
AB  - Rabbits were immunized with common antigen (CA) derived from Salmonella typhimurium. Animals with CA hemagglutinin titers of 1-320 to 1-81,920 were injected with 10(7) viable Proteus mirabilis via the retrograde and hematogenous routes. Nonimmune control groups were challenged similarly. From the retrogradely challenged groups sacrificed at 4 weeks, pyelonephritis was found in 89% of the control animals but not in those immunized. Bacteriuria was present in 89% of the controls but in only 61% of the immunized group. Hematogenously challenged, immune animals sacrificed at 6 weeks did not show histological evidence of renal pathology, and only 6% had bacteriuria. Eighty-six per cent of the nonimmune controls showed both pyelonephritis and bacteriuria. The protective effect is specific because of the following. (i) Active and passive CA immunization did not prevent pyelonephritis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa which does not produce this antigen. (ii) Passive immunization with a CA antiserum conferred protection against a P. mirabilis challenge. (iii) Passive administration of an antiserum from which CA antibodies had been differentially absorbed abolished the protective activity.
TI  - Sensitivity of Gram-negative bacilli to ampicillin after six years' clinical use.
AB  - A total of 1,102 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli was obtained from four hospitals during 1967 and these cultures were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin. Approximately 80% of the strains of Escherichia coli and 90% of the strains of Proteus mirabilis, the two organisms most frequently isolated, were sensitive to ampicillin. Klebsiella-Enterobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were generally insensitive. Comparison of these results with data obtained in an earlier study with Gram-negative organisms isolated in 1961 showed that there had been no significant increase in the incidence of resistance of Gram-negative bacilli to ampicillin during the period 1961-67. The majority of ampicillin-resistant strains of E. coli isolated in 1967 transferred ampicillin resistance to a sensitive strain of E. coli K12. Only four ampicillin-resistant strains of E. coli isolated in 1961 were available for transferable resistance tests but all four strains transferred ampicillin resistance. Infective or transferable resistance was therefore a feature of ampicillin resistance of certain Gram-negative bacteria before ampicillin became generally available for clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of coumermycin A1.
AB  - The in vitro activity of coumermycin A(1) was compared with that of novobiocin, ampicillin, and minocycline. Coumermycin was found to be the most active antibiotic of the four against Staphylococcus aureus. It was about 50 times more active than novobiocin or minocycline against the strains tested. Coumermycin also showed good activity against group A streptococci and pneumococci, moderate activity against Escherichia coli, indole-positive Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against Klebsiella-Enterobacter and enterococci. Against P. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. The new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. Coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. Also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.
TI  - Gram-negative bacilli in burns.
AB  - In a period of two years, 865 strains of Gram-negative bacilli other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from burns were identified by a range of tests. The commonest species were Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae. Many strains of Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Bacterium anitratum were also found.A large proportion of the strains were tested for sensitivity to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and carbenicillin, and smaller numbers of strains were tested for sensitivity to cephaloridine, polymyxin, streptomycin, sulphadiazine, sulfamylon, and trimethoprim. The proportion of strains sensitive and resistant to different antibacterial agents varied widely with species of bacteria. A large proportion of the strains of E. coli and P. mirabilis were resistant to ampicillin, which was much used in treatment; resistance appeared least often towards nalidixic acid, kanamycin, trimethoprim, and gentamicin. Multiple resistance occurred less often among strains of E. coli than among Klebsiella spp, Enterobacter spp, and P. mirabilis. Phage and serological typing of Ps. aeruginosa showed that most infections of burns with this organism were due to strains previously found in other patients in the same ward. Taken with other evidence, this supported the view that most infections with Ps. aeruginosa were not acquired from the patient's own flora but from sources in the hospital environment.
TI  - Salmonella suppression by known populations of bacteria in flies.
AB  - Survivorship of Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was studied in dibiotic and tribiotic interactions in vitro and in various regions of the digestive tract of the blow fly, Calliphora vicina. In dibiotic interactions, Salmonella typhimurium dominated Streptococcus faecalis and was dominated by P. mirabilis, but in neither case was it eliminated from the larval gut. In tribiotic interactions, there was synergic suppression and a definite trend toward elimination of Salmonella typhimurium from the gut. This trend approaches but does not match the total exclusion of S. typhimurium from the gut of maggots with a normal flora. Bacterial survival in the gut of the fly is discussed in relation to doubling time, sweep-out rate of the maggot and prepupal gut, and the midgut bactericide.
TI  - Protection by vaccination against Pseudomonas infection after thermal injury.
AB  - Active immunization is effective in the prophylaxis of Pseudomonas septicemia in  burned mice. Vaccines were prepared from bacterial cells and growth medium of Verder's 10 different O serological types of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, as well as from Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. Mice given a tail burn could be significantly protected against a local Pseudomonas challenge by both specific and, to a lesser extent, by nonspecific Pseudomonas vaccines prepared either from bacterial cells or from the medium in which they were grown. The vaccine was effective when administered prior to or after thermal trauma. After a more extensive rump burn, the protective effect of a specific vaccine given after thermal injury was significant only when the challenge was postponed until 4 days postburn; the level of protection was less than in the mice with smaller burns.
TI  - Occurrence of chloramphenicol-acetylating enzymes in various gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The occurrence of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme, similar to that found in  Escherichia coli, carrying an R factor was investigated in various gram-negative bacilli. The acetylated products of chloramphenicol were identified by chromatography and quantitatively assayed after benzene extraction. The investigated strains were of the Salmonella-Arizona group, the Klebsiella-Aerobacter group, Serratia marcescens, the Proteus group, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most of which were isolated from 1947 to 1957. Both chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant strains were included, but none of them was able to transfer chloramphenicol resistance by conjugation. In the Proteus group, a significant level of a chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme was found in most strains, whether they were sensitive or resistant to chloramphenicol; the resistant strains showed higher levels of the enzyme. Some chloramphenicol-sensitive strains lacked this enzyme. Only the sensitive strains containing the enzyme could easily produce chloramphenicol-resistant mutants with higher enzyme activity. Thus, the chloramphenicol resistance of this group can be reasonably explained on the basis of the chloramphenicol-acetylating enzyme. All of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to chloramphenicol, and most strains showed low levels of the enzyme (which, however, did not appear sufficient to explain their resistance). All of the strains of the other groups (except one strain of Enterobacter cloacae) lacked the enzyme, although most strains of the Klebsiella-Aerobacter group and of S. marcescens were resistant to chloramphenicol. With respect to the origin of the resistance gene of the R factor, it is noteworthy that the strains of Proteus mirabilis isolated in 1947 possessed this enzyme before the discovery of chloramphenicol.

TI  - A NEW SELECTIVE BLOOD AGAR MEDIUM FOR STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES AND OTHER HAEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI.
AB  - Horse blood agar containing polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, Str. pyogenes. In a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (P.N.F.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with Str. pyogenes; P.N.F. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of Str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of Str. pyogenes from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. Haemolytic streptococci of groups A, C, D, G, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on P.N.F. medium than on blood 4% agar. Viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of Str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on P.N.F. medium. These limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.

TI  - IN VITRO BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF CEPHALOTHIN.
AB  - Chang, Te-Wen (Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass.) and Louis Weinstein. In vitro biological activity of cephalothin. J. Bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-Cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. Shigella, Salmonella, and Proteus mirabilis were the most sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Herellea were highly resistant. Penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. Exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with S. aureus. Cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. Cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. This antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin G but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.
