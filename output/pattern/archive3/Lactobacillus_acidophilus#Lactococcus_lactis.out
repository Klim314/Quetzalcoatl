role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.
isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus), gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
formation of oligosaccharides in skim milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures, lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis and probiotic strains of lactobacilli.
milk fermented with mixed dahi cultures ncdc167, lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis ncdc60 and two probiotic strains; lactobacillus acidophilus ncdc14 and lb. casei ncdc19 were evaluated after fermentation (14 h) and during 8 d storage at 7 degrees c. the beta-galactosidase activity was found to increase after fermentation leading to the hydrolysis of lactose and production of glucose, galactose and oligosaccharides; that subsequently decreased during storage. the viable counts of lactococci and lactobacilli decreased during storage yet remained >106 cfu/ml after storage. the results of present study indicate that all the selected cultures have ability to produce oligosaccharides (prebiotics) due to transgalactosidal and lactose hydrolysis activities of beta-galactosidase. the cultures developed an active synbiotic formula by maintaining sufficient probiotic viable counts to exert health benefits to the consumers.
viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
in vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus sp., and salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (fos-50 or fos pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. thirteen bacteria (two strains of bacillus coagulans, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, b. bifidum, e. faecium, two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, pediococcus sp., propionibacterium acidopropionici, p. jensenii, and propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six salmonella serotypes (s. california, s. enteritidis, s. heidelberg, s. mission, s. senftenberg, and s. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. bifidobacterium bifidum, e. faecium, all lactobacilli, and pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all salmonella serotypes. in the growth experiments, e. faecium, l. lactis, and pediococcus sp. grew in media with either fos-50 or the pure formulation of fos as the sole carbohydrate source. all tested salmonella serotypes utilized fos-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. in contrast, none of the salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of fos as the only carbohydrate source.
studies on antimutagenic effect of milk cultured with lactic acid bacteria on the trp-p2-induced mutagenicity to ta98 strain of salmonella typhimurium.
the inhibitory effects of cultured milk using 76 strains of lactic acid bacteria  isolated from milk products were investigated on the mutagenicity of 3-amino-1-methyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (trp-p2), a tryptophan pyrolysate for salmonella typhimurium ta98. each cultured milk sample displayed its characteristic antimutagenic effect against the mutagenicity of trp-p2. the milk cultured with lactobacillus acidophilus la106 (la2) showed the highest inhibition of 82.1% among the strains used. milk samples cultured with lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lll103 (10-3) and lll102 (km) also exhibited higher inhibition percentages.
bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
the bacteriocinogenicity of lactococcus lactis atcc 11454, pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 43200, p. pentosaceus atcc 43201, lactobacillus plantarum bn, l. plantarum lb592, l. plantarum lb75, and lactobacillus acidophilus n2 against clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees c was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. all the strains, except l. acidophilus n2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of c. botulinum spores at 30 degrees c. l. plantarum bn, l. lactis atcc 11454, and p. pentosaceus atcc 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees c. supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% nacl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of l. plantarum bn and l. lactis atcc 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees c. these results suggest that low levels of l. plantarum bn or l. lactis atcc 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% nacl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
