TI  - Characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  - A total of 788 clinical Enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (AME genes) and to characterize the plasmids that carry these genes. Among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 Escherichia coli (80%), 33 Proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six K. oxytoca (1.8%), five Enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three Morganella morganii (0.9%), three Providencia stuartii (0.9%), two Salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each Citrobacter freundii, C. koseri, Proteus vulgaris, and Shigella sonnei. The most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). The AME genes found were aph(3'')-Ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-Ia (37.5%), aph(3')-Ia (13.9%), aac(3)-IIa (12.4%), aac(6')-Ib (4.2%), ant(2'')-Ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-IIa (1.2%). Thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. The most frequent association was ant(3'')-Ia plus aph(3'')-Ib (35 strains). From 66 selected AME genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-IIa, six aph(3')-Ia, three ant(3'')-Ia, two ant(2'')-Ia, and one aac(6')-Ib. These genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups F, FIA, FIB, or HI2. In conclusion, the AME genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib, and ant(2'')-Ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.
TI  - Genetic environment and expression of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase blaPER-1 gene in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The genetic location of the gene coding for the expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase  PER-1 was analyzed in a series of gram-negative isolates. It was identified as part of a composite transposon bracketed by two novel insertion elements, ISPa12 and ISPa13, belonging to the IS4 family that possess transposases that share 63% amino acid identity and that are chromosomally located in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia stuartii, and Acinetobacter baumannii. On the contrary, the bla(PER-1) gene was identified just downstream of an ISPa12 element but not within a composite transposon when it was located on a plasmid in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and A. baumannii isolates. In both cases, expression of the bla(PER-1) gene was driven by promoter sequences located in ISPa12.
TI  - Cell-to-cell signalling in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica.
AB  - Cell-to-cell signalling in prokaryotes that leads to co-ordinated behaviour has been termed quorum sensing. This type of signalling can have profound impacts on microbial community structure and host-microbe interactions. The Gram-negative quorum-sensing systems were first discovered and extensively characterized in the marine Vibrios. Some components of the Vibrio systems are present in the classical genetic model organisms Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Both organisms encode a signal receptor of the LuxR family, SdiA, but not a corresponding signal-generating enzyme. Instead, SdiA of Salmonella detects and responds to signals generated only by other microbial species. Conversely, E. coli and Salmonella encode the signal-generating component of a second system (a LuxS homologue that generates AI-2), but the sensory apparatus for AI-2 differs substantially from the Vibrio system. The only genes currently known to be regulated by AI-2 in Salmonella encode an active uptake and modification system for AI-2. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether Salmonella uses AI-2 as a signal molecule or whether AI-2 has some other function. In E. coli, the functions of both SdiA and AI-2 are unclear due to pleiotropy. Genetic strategies to identify novel signalling systems have been performed with E. coli and Providencia stuartii. Several putative signalling systems have been identified, one that uses indole as a signal and another that releases what appears to be a peptide. The latter system has homologues in E. coli and Salmonella, as well as other bacteria, plants and animals. In fact, the protease components from Providencia and Drosophila are functionally interchangeable.
TI  - GASP phenotype: presence in enterobacteria and independence of sigmaS in its acquisition.
AB  - The appearance of growth advantage in stationary phase or GASP was originally detected in Escherichia coli. The presence of this phenotype in other enterobacteria such as Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Providencia stuartii and Shigella dysenteriae is described in this work. E. cloacae GASP strains presented lower levels of RpoS than the parental strain, although no mutation in the gene or its promoter was detected. This work offers evidence of GASP rpoS-independent pathways as GASP was also acquired in knock-out rpoS E. cloacae and E. coli strains.
TI  - Cloning of the mgtE Mg2+ transporter from Providencia stuartii and the distribution of mgtE in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The MM281 strain of Salmonella typhimurium possesses mutations in each of its three Mg2+ transport systems, requires 100 mM Mg2+ for growth, and was used to screen a genomic library from the gram-negative bacterium Providencia stuartii for clones that could restore the ability to grow without Mg2+ supplementation. The clones obtained also conferred sensitivity to Co2+, a phenotype similar to that seen with the S. typhimurium corA Mg2+ transport gene. The sequence of the cloned P. stuartii DNA revealed the presence of a single open reading frame, which was shown to express a protein with a gel molecular mass of 37 kDa in agreement with the deduced size of 34 kDa. Despite a phenotype similar to that of corA and the close phylogenetic relationship between P. stuartii and S. typhimurium, this new putative Mg2+ transporter lacks similarity to the CorA Mg2+ transporter and is instead homologous to MgtE, a newly discovered Mg2+ transport protein from the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus firmus OF4. The distribution of mgtE in bacteria was studied by Southern blot hybridization to PCR amplification products. In contrast to the ubiquity of the corA gene, which encodes the dominant constitutive Mg2+ influx system of bacteria, mgtE has a much more limited phylogenetic distribution.
TI  - Characterization and sequence of PhoC, the principal phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase of Morganella morganii.
AB  - Phosphatase activities were investigated in Morganella morganii, which is one of  the few enterobacterial species producing high-level phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase activity (HPAP phenotype), and the gene encoding the major phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase was cloned, sequenced, and its product characterized. Using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate, Morganella produced a major phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase (named PhoC) which is associated with the HPAP phenotype, a minor phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase, and a phosphate-repressible alkaline phosphatase. The presence of the PhoC activity prevented induction of alkaline phosphatase when a PhoC-hydrolysable organic phosphate ester, such as glycerol 2-phosphate, was the sole phosphate source. PhoC is a secreted nonspecific acid phosphatase apparently composed of four 25 kDa polypeptide subunits. The enzyme is resistant to EDTA, P(i), fluoride and tartrate. The M. morganii PhoC showed 84.6% amino acid sequence identity to the PhoN nonspecific acid phosphatase of Providencia stuartii, 45.3% to the PhoN nonspecific acid phosphatase of Salmonella typhimurium, and 37.8% to the principal acid phosphatase (PhoC) of Zymomonas mobilis. Comparison of sequence data and of regulation of these enzymes suggested a different phylogeny of members of this gene family within the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Horizontal transfer of a phosphatase gene as evidence for mosaic structure of the Salmonella genome.
AB  - The genomes of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium are similar with respect to base composition, chromosome size, and the order, orientation and spacing of genes, but differ with respect to some 29 'loops', regions unique to one species. To evaluate the genetic basis for the structure and organization of the enteric bacterial genomes, we examined the gene encoding a non-specific acid phosphatase (phoN) which maps to a loop at 96 min on the S.typhimurium chromosome. We detected atypical base composition, codon usage pattern and trinucleotide frequencies. The 1.4 kb region containing phoN had an overall base composition of 43% G+C, while the G+C content at the third positions of codons in the phoN reading frame is only 39%, much lower than the Salmonella chromosome which averages 52%. Non-specific acid phosphatase activity, assayed in 14 Gram-negative species, was detected only in Morganella morganii and Providencia stuartii, organisms with low genomic G+C contents. Upstream of the phoN gene in Salmonella is a sequence with high similarity to the oriT region of incFII plasmids, suggesting that the phoN gene, and perhaps the entire loop structure, was acquired by lateral transmission in a plasmid-mediated event.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of a ticarcillin-clavulanic acid combination in severe infections in adults].
AB  - Timentin (ticarcillin (TCR) + clavulanic acid (AC)) was given for severe bacterial infections to sixteen hospitalized patients (10 male and 6 female; 16 to 75 years of age; normal renal function in 12). Infections included 8 septicemias (of which 4 were secondary to pyelonephritis), 6 pyelonephritis (in addition to the four above-mentioned cases), and 3 suppurated cellulitis of the lower limbs (with septicemia in one case). The following bacteria were recovered: 10 Escherichia coli, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Providencia stuartii, 1 Salmonella typhi, 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 Staphylococcus aureus. The sixteen strains were all susceptible to timentin (MICs determined by agar dilution: TCR + AC 4 mg/l: 0.5-16 mg/l; TCR + AC 8 mg/l: 0.2-16 mg/l). Thirteen strains were susceptible to TCR (MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l), and three (1 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, and 1 S. aureus) were resistant to TCR (MIC greater than or equal to 256 mg/l). 14 patients received timentin alone, while two were also given dibekacin. Timentin was given in one-hour IV infusions in a dosage of 9.6 g/24 h (3.2 g X 3) in 10 patients and 6.4 g/24 h (3.2 g X 2) in 6. Duration of therapy was 14 to 16 days in half of cases (range 5 to 21 days). At termination of the infusion, serum concentrations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (determined in ten patients) were greater than 50 mg/l and 3-7.4 mg/l respectively, and serum bactericidal activity (evaluated in ten cases) was consistently less than 1/2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Plasmid pattern analysis of natural bacterial isolates and its epidemiological implication.
AB  - Natural isolates of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Providencia stuartii were analysed to determine their plasmid content. This data allowed the identification of nosocomial strains of K. pneumoniae and P. stuartii and helped in the differentiation of epidemic strains of E. coli 0111 and S. typhimurium. Phenotypically similar isolates of S. typhimurium could be shown to be of independent origin using plasmid pattern analysis. The dissemination of a particular plasmid through different strains of S. typhimurium resulted in a simulation of a very widely distributed epidemic strain, because the plasmid interfered with the phage type of its host strain in addition to determining resistance properties. Plasmid pattern analysis disclosed two independently existing but interacting epidemic processes: a bacterial 'epidemic' strain may become disseminated over a large territory and may predominate there for a long time; a single plasmid, however, may also become distributed through many different bacterial strains and may spread over a large territory. Plasmid pattern analysis provides a valuable and universal epidemiological laboratory method.
