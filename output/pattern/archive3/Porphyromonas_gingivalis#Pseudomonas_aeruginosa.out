antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic alpha-helical  octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase of rice.
amyi-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase (amyi-1) of rice (oryza  sativa l. japonica), is a novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (amp) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using a chemiluminescence method that measures atp derived from viable cells. of the ten kinds of human pathogens, amyi-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against nine. its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ics50 ) against porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 mum, respectively. amyi-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 mum, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 mum. the degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from p. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of amyi-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of p. aeruginosa, s. mutans, and c. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (pi), a dna-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when amyi-1-18 was added at a concentration equal to its 4xic50 . therefore, the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against p. aeruginosa and s. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. in contrast, its antimicrobial activity against p. gingivalis and c. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. collectively, these results indicate that amyi-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent amp against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare.

actin enables the antimicrobial action of ll-37 peptide in the presence of microbial proteases.
host defense peptides play an important host-protective role by their microcidal  action, immunomodulatory functions, and tissue repair activities. proteolysis is a common strategy of pathogens used to neutralize host defense peptides. here, we show that actin, the most abundant structural protein in eukaryotes, binds the ll-37 host defense peptide, protects it from degradation by the proteases of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis, and enables its antimicrobial activity despite the presence of the proteases. co-localization of ll-37 with extracellular actin was observed in necrotized regions of samples from oral lesions. competition assays, cross-linking experiments, limited proteolysis, and mass spectrometry revealed that ll-37 binds by specific hydrophobic interactions to the his-40-lys-50 segment of actin, located in the dnase i binding loop. the integrity of the binding site of both ll-37 and actin is a prerequisite to the binding. our results demonstrate that actin, presumably released by dead cells and abundant in infected sites, might be utilized by the immune system to enhance spatio-temporal immunity in an attempt to arrest infection and control inflammation.
porphyromonas gingivalis modulates pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced apoptosis of respiratory epithelial cells through the stat3 signaling pathway.
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of respiratory and other organ systems in immunocompromised hosts that may invade and proliferate in mucosal epithelial cells to induce apoptosis. previous studies suggest that oral bacteria, especially gram-negative periodontal pathogens, may enhance p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to augment tissue destruction. in this study, we investigated the effect of the periodontopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis on p. aeruginosa-induced epithelial cell apoptosis. p. gingivalis invasion transiently inhibited p. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis in respiratory epithelial cells via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) signaling pathway. the activated stat3 up-regulated the downstream anti-apoptotic moleculars survivin and b-cell leukemia-2 (bcl-2). this process was accompanied by down-regulation of pro-apoptosis molecular bcl-2-associated death promoter (bad) and caspase-3 activity inhibition. in addition, the activation of the stat3 pathway was affected by p. gingivalis in a dose-dependent manner. finally, co-invasion of p. aeruginosa and p. gingivalis led to greater cell death compared with p. aeruginosa challenge alone. these results suggest that regulation of p. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis by p. gingivalis contributes to the pathogenesis of respiratory disease. interference with this process may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of respiratory disease.
the papain inhibitor (spi) of streptomyces mobaraensis inhibits bacterial cysteine proteases and is an antagonist of bacterial growth.
a novel papain inhibitory protein (spi) from streptomyces mobaraensis was studied to measure its inhibitory effect on bacterial cysteine protease activity (staphylococcus aureus sspb) and culture supernatants (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacillus anthracis). further, growth of bacillus anthracis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae was completely inhibited by 10 mum spi. at this concentration of spi, no cytotoxicity was observed. we conclude that spi inhibits bacterial virulence factors and has the potential to become a novel therapeutic treatment against a range of unrelated pathogenic bacteria.
dna/protamine complex paste for an injectable dental material.
a dna/protamine complex powder was prepared by reaction between dna and protamine sulfate solution with stirring in order to develop a new injectable biomaterials for dental therapy. the powder of dna/protamine complex became paste by kneading the complex powder and distilled water. complex formation was confirmed by ft-ir measurement. the complex paste had a porous structure and its viscosity was approximately 280.1 pas. the paste could easily pass through a needle of 0.25 mm internal diameter. it seemed that dna/protamine complex paste has suitable viscosity for clinical use as an injectable biomaterial. although, the complex paste delayed the growth speed of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia for limited periods, it cannot kill and inhibit growing bacteria. the complex paste disk showed a mild tissue response and gradually degraded after the implantation into the soft tissue of rats. these results suggested that this dna/protamine complex paste could be a useful material for a biodegradable biomaterial. in particular, this paste will be applicable as an injectable biomaterial using syringe for the repair of defects of living tissue, gbr treatment and/or gtr treatment in dentistry.
interactions between various microbes and ginseng botanicals.
three kinds of interactions occur between ginseng botanicals and microorganisms:  a) spoilage of the botanical by various fungi (e.g., aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria, and eurotium species) and bacteria; b) transformation of ginsenosides into more bioactive forms by bacteria such as intrasporangium sp. gs603, microbacterium sp. gs514, caulobacter leidyia, bifidobacterium sp. int57, bifidobacterium sp. sj32, fusobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp., and moulds (e.g., aspergillus niger, fusarium sacchari, paecilomyces bainier sp. 229, rhizopus stolonifer, myrothecium verrucaria and acremonium strictum); and c) inhibition of certain bacteria (propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa), fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus, fusarium oxysporum) and viruses by ginseng constituents.
effect of muc7 peptides on the growth of bacteria and on streptococcus mutans biofilm.
objectives: to investigate the susceptibility of selected bacteria as well as streptococcus mutans biofilm to muc7 peptides and compare the activities with those of other known antimicrobial peptides. methods: mic and mbc of peptides for s. mutans, escherichia coli, streptococcus gordonii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using the microdilution method. for s. mutans, the effects of the peptides on the kinetics of growth inhibition, time-killing, and on biofilm formation and reduction were also examined. for biofilm studies, polystyrene microtitre plates, calgary biofilm device (cbd) and hydroxylapatite (ha) discs, along with crystal violet and alamar blue dyes, and/or em observations, were employed. results: s. mutans was the most susceptible to all peptides tested (mics of 9.4-25.0 microm), compared with the other species (mics of 3.1->100 microm). muc7 peptides (except muc7-12-mer-l4) exerted 2-fold higher activity against s. mutans than hsn5-12-mer and magainin-ii, and faster killing of s. mutans than hsn5-12-mer. the muc7 peptides also had an effect on s. mutans biofilm. on the polystyrene plates, they suppressed the biofilm formation, with mbic(50) of 6.25-12.5 microm, and reduced the 1 day developed biofilm in a batch culture, with mbrc(50) of 25-50 microm. on the cbd pegs, the viabilities of the biofilm were suppressed by >95% in the presence of muc7 peptides at 4x mic (50 microm). one day developed biofilm viabilities were inhibited by 49-75%. on ha, the formation of biofilm (as observed by em) was also considerably reduced. conclusions: muc7 peptides present somewhat preferential antimicrobial activity against s. mutans. they also have an effect on in vitro formation and reduction of the preformed s. mutans biofilm.
lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the n1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
immunopharmacological activities of the nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid a of porphyromonas gingivalis.
the low endotoxic lipid a derived from porphyromonas gingivalis 381, 1-phospho beta(1-6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide with 3-hydroxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl and 3-hexadecanoyloxy-15-methylhexadecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-positions, respectively, induced mitogenic responses in lps low responder c3h/hej as well as lps responder c3h/hen mouse splenocytes. the mitogenic activities of p. gingivalis lipid a in splenocytes of lps responder mice were comparable to that of the synthetic escherichia coli-type lipid a (compound 506). the addition of polymyxin b resulted in the inhibition of mitogenic activity. p. gingivalis lipid a also stimulated strongly nonspecific host resistance against pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in balb/c mice, and specific immune response in guinea pigs against infection with p. gingivalis. furthermore, p. gingivalis lipid a demonstrated antitumour activity against mh134 hepatoma in c3h/hen mice. these life-preserving with tumour regression properties were comparable to those of monophosphoryl lipid a derived from salmonella minnesota re 595. thus, p. gingivalis lipid a appears to have beneficial properties as an immunopharmacological agent.
