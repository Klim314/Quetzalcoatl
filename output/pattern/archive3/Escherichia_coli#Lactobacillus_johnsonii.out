effects of lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus reuteri on gut barrier function and heat shock proteins in intestinal porcine epithelial cells.
heat shock proteins (hsps) are a set of highly conserved proteins that can serve  as intestinal gate keepers in gut homeostasis. here, effects of a probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), and two novel porcine isolates, lactobacillus johnsonii strain p47-hy and lactobacillus reuteri strain p43-huv, on cytoprotective hsp expression and gut barrier function, were investigated in a porcine ipec-j2 intestinal epithelial cell line model. the ipec-j2 cells polarized on a permeable filter exhibited villus-like cell phenotype with development of apical microvilli. western blot analysis detected hsp expression in ipec-j2 and revealed that l. johnsonii and l. reuteri strains were able to significantly induce hsp27, despite high basal expression in ipec-j2, whereas lgg did not. for hsp72, only the supernatant of l. reuteri induced the expression, which was comparable to the heat shock treatment, which indicated that hsp72 expression was more stimulus specific. the protective effect of lactobacilli was further studied in ipec-j2 under an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. etec caused intestinal barrier destruction, as reflected by loss of cell-cell contact, reduced ipec-j2 cell viability and transepithelial electrical resistance, and disruption of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1. in contrast, the l. reuteri treatment substantially counteracted these detrimental effects and preserved the barrier function. l. johnsonii and lgg also achieved barrier protection, partly by directly inhibiting etec attachment. together, the results indicate that specific strains of lactobacillus can enhance gut barrier function through cytoprotective hsp induction and fortify the cell protection against etec challenge through tight junction protein modulation and direct interaction with pathogens.
individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.
a mesocosm of lactobacillus johnsonii, bifidobacterium longum, and escherichia coli in the mouse gut.
the relative contribution of competition and cooperation at the microbe-microbe level is not well understood for the bacteria constituting the gut microbiota. the high number and variability of human gut commensals have hampered the analysis. to get some insight into the question how so many different bacterial species can coexist in the mammalian gut, we studied the interaction between three human gut commensals (escherichia coli k-12, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533, and bifidobacterium longum ncc2705) in the intestine of gnotobiotic mice. the bacterial titers and their anatomical distribution were studied in the colonized mice. l. johnsonii achieved the highest cell counts in the stomach, while b. longum dominated the colon. the colon was also the intestinal location in which b. longum displayed the highest number of expressed genes, followed by the cecum and the small intestine. addition of further bacterial strains led to strikingly different results. a lactobacillus paracasei strain coexisted, while a second b. longum strain was excluded from the system. notably, this strain lacked an operon involved in the degradation, import, and metabolism of mannosylated glycans. subsequent introduction of the e. coli nissle strain resulted in the elimination of l. johnsonii ncc533 and e. coli k-12, while b. longum ncc2705 showed a transient decrease in population size, demonstrating the dynamic nature of microbe-microbe interactions. the study of such simple interacting bacterial systems might help to derive some basic rules governing microbial ecology within the mammalian gut.
adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.
in vivo characterization of lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 for use as a defined competitive exclusion agent against bacterial pathogens in poultry.
aims: to test the efficacy of lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 in reducing the colonization and shedding of salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis, escherichia coli o78:k80 and clostridium perfringens in poultry. methods and results: specific pathogen-free chicks (1 day old) were dosed with a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) cfu. lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 and 24 h later were challenged in separate experiments with s. enteritidis (s1400, nalr) and e. coli o78:k80 (ec34195, nalr). there were no significant effects against s. enteritidis whereas colonization of the small intestine by e. coli o78:k80 was reduced significantly. both s. enteritidis and e. coli colonized the caeca and colon to levels equivalent to control birds and there was no reduction in shedding as assessed by a semi-quantitative cloacal swabbing technique. specific pathogen-free chicks (20 day old) were dosed with a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) cfu l. johnsonii fi9785 and 24 h later were challenged with c. perfringens. a single oral dose of l. johnsonii fi9785 was sufficient to suppress all aspects of colonization and persistence of c. perfringens. conclusions: lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 may be given to poultry for use as a competitive exclusion agent to control c. perfringens. significance and impact of the study: lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 may be a valuable tool to control the endemic disease of necrotic enteritis, thereby reducing economic losses associated with reduced use of antimicrobials in the poultry industry.
isolation of a novel is3 group insertion element and construction of an integration vector for lactobacillus spp.
an insertion sequence (is) element from lactobacillus johnsonii was isolated, characterized, and exploited to construct an is-based integration vector. l. johnsonii nck61, a high-frequency conjugal donor of bacteriocin production (laf+) and immunity (lafr), was transformed to erythromycin resistance (emr) with the shuttle vector psa3. the nck61 conjugative functions were used to mobilize psa3 into a laf- lafs ems recipient. dna from the emr transconjugants transformed into escherichia coli mc1061 yielded a resolution plasmid with the same size as that of psa3 with a 1.5-kb insertion. the gram-positive replication region of the resolution plasmid was removed to generate a psa3-based suicide vector (ptrk327) bearing the 1.5-kb insert of lactobacillus origin. plasmid ptrk327 inserted randomly into the chromosomes of both lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323 and vpi 11759. no homology was detected between plasmid and total host dnas, suggesting a rec-independent insertion. the dna sequence of the 1.5-kb region revealed the characteristics of an is element (designated is1223): a length of 1,492 bp; flanking, 25-bp, imperfect inverted repeats; and two overlapping open reading frames (orfs). sequence comparisons revealed 71.1% similarity, including 35.7% identity, between the deduced orfb protein of the e. coli is element is150 and the putative orfb protein encoded by the lactobacillus is element. a putative frameshift site was detected between the overlapping orfs of the lactobacillus is element. it is proposed that, similar to is150, is1223 produces an active transposase via translational frameshifting between two tandem, overlapping orfs.
molecular analysis of the lactacin f operon.
lactacin f is a nonlantibiotic, heat-stable, peptide bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi11088. molecular analysis of the lactacin f dna region characterized a small operon that codes for three open reading frames, designated lafa, lafx, and orfz. the peptide encoded by lafa, the lactacin f structural gene, was compared with various peptide bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria, and similarities were identified in the amino and carboxy termini of the propeptides. site-directed mutagenesis of the lafa precursor at the two glycine residues in positions -1 and -2 defined an essential motif for processing of mature lactacin f. the involvement of the peptides encoded by lafx and orfz in bacteriocin expression was investigated by subcloning various fragments from the lactacin f region into the shuttle vector pgkv210. in addition to lafa, expression of lafx is essential to lactacin f activity. the lactacin f operon resembles the genetic organization of lactococcin m. although no function has been assigned to orfz by genetic analysis, both peptide z and the lactococcin m immunity protein are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with four putative transmembrane segments. lactacin f activity, defined by bactericidal action on lactobacillus delbrueckii, is dependent on the expression of two genes, lafa and lafx.
