TI  == classification, identification, and clinical significance of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with host specificity for humans.
AB  == the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the current classification and identification of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with exclusive or predominant host specificity for humans. haemophilus influenzae and  some of the other haemophilus species are commonly encountered in the clinical microbiology laboratory and demonstrate a wide range of pathogenicity, from life-threatening invasive disease to respiratory infections to a nonpathogenic, commensal lifestyle. new species of haemophilus have been described (haemophilus  pittmaniae and haemophilus sputorum), and the new genus aggregatibacter was created to accommodate some former haemophilus and actinobacillus species (aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter segnis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). aggregatibacter species are now a dominant etiology of infective endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms (hacek endocarditis), and a. aphrophilus has emerged as an important cause of brain abscesses. correct identification of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species based on phenotypic characterization can be challenging. it has become clear that 15 to 20% of presumptive h. influenzae isolates from the respiratory tracts of healthy individuals do not belong to this species but represent nonhemolytic variants of  haemophilus haemolyticus. due to the limited pathogenicity of h. haemolyticus, the proportion of misidentified strains may be lower in clinical samples, but even among invasive strains, a misidentification rate of 0.5 to 2% can be found.  several methods have been investigated for differentiation of h. influenzae from  its less pathogenic relatives, but a simple method for reliable discrimination is not available. with the implementation of identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the more rarely encountered species of haemophilus and aggregatibacter will increasingly be identified in clinical microbiology practice. however, identification of some strains will still be problematic, necessitating dna sequencing of multiple housekeeping gene fragments or full-length 16s rrna genes.

TI  == identification of hacek clinical isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry is a rapid and accurate tool for the identification of many microorganisms. we assessed this technology for the identification of 103 haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae (hacek) clinical isolates and 20 haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates. ninety-three percent of hacek organisms were identified correctly to the genus level using the bruker database, and 100% were identified to the genus level using a custom database that included clinical isolates.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == electron microscopy of phages in serotypes of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinobacillus ureae, haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, pasteurella haemolytica and pasteurella multocida strains were examined by transmission electron microscopy for the presence of bacteriophages.  phages were detected in serotype a (suny 75) and e (uoh 1705) and in the fresh clinical isolates uoh q1243 and uoh q1247 of a. actinomycetemcomitans. phages were not found in serotype b, c and d strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, in the fresh clinical isolate uoh q1244 of this species or in old strains (including reference strains) of related species from the actinobacillus-haemophilus-pasteurella group.

TI  == multivariate chemosystematics demonstrate two groups of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains.
AB  == chemical analysis by us has indicated that actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is not a homogeneous species. the present study used chemometric methods and a multitude of chemical characters to examine this further. strains were characterized by cell sugar and fatty acid contents, lysis kinetics during edta and edta plus lysozyme exposure, methylene blue reduction, and api zym enzymatic  assessment of whole cells and outer membrane vesicles/fragments. in total, 41 quantitative variables were analyzed from each of 9 strains and treated with principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy. these methods divided a. actinomycetemcomitans into 2 strain groups. one group contained atcc 33384, atcc 29522, fdc 2112 and fdc 2043; the other comprised atcc 29524, atcc 29523, fdc 2097, fdc 511 and fdc y4. with an f-test, the groups (classes) of a. actinomycetemcomitans strains could be distinguished at 95% confidence limits. both groups were distinct from members of the genera haemophilus and pasteurella (haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, pasteurella multocida and pasteurella haemolytica).
