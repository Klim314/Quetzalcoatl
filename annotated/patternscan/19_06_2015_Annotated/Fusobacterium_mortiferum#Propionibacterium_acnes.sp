TI  == subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).

TI  == the use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  == an anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. these included bacteroides spp (43%), peptococcus spp (26%),  peptostreptococcus spp (13%), veillonella spp (7%), fusobacterium spp (7%), clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of  the study period. miles and misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for f nucleatum, but no difference for b fragilis, b thetaiomicron, b uniformis, b bivius, b corrodens, f mortiferum, ps anaerobius, p prevotii or propionibacterium acnes. in almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. the anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. however, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.

TI  == in vitro activity of tiamulin (81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin derivative, against clinically significant anaerobes.
AB  == the susceptibility of more than 40 strains of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to tiamulin (sandoz 81.723 hfu), a new pleuromulin (pleuromutilin) derivative, was determined by broth dilution and agar dilution tests. the influences of density of the inoculum upon mics was studied by a specially designed pour plate-technique. bacteroides fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. splanchnicus, b. oralis, b. asaccharolyticus, b. melaninogenicus, fusobacterium fusiforme (f. nucleatum), sphaerophorus necrophorus, clostridium perfringens, c.  fallax, propionibacterium acnes and several species of peptococcaceae showed broth dilution mics of 0.03 similar to 1 microgram/ml. members of b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum) were inhibited by 8 similar to 32 microgram/ml and 2 strains of s. varius had a broth dilution mic  of 256 microgram/ml. with most strains, the agar dilution mics were 2 similar to  4 similar to 8 times the broth dilution mics. in pour plate-tests, the mics were  not considerably influenced influenced by varying initial concentrations of viable cells. with most anaerobes, the mbcs of tiamulin were more than 100-fold higher than the mics. the results obtained indicated that, apart from s. varius,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis and s. freundii (f. mortiferum), members of 16 other anaerobic species including b. fragilis were without exception sensitive to tiamulin.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.
