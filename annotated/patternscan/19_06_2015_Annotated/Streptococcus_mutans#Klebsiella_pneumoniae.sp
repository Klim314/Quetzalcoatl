TI  == synthesis of silver nanoparticles using solanum trilobatum fruits extract and its antibacterial, cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line mcf 7.
AB  == in the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles by a simple and eco-friendly method using unripe fruits of solanum trilobatum. the aqueous silver ions when exposed to unripe fruits extract were reduced and stabilized over long  time resulting in biosynthesis of surface functionalized silver nanoparticles. the bio-reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by uv-visible spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (edx) and x-ray diffraction (xrd). these biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antibacterial activity against few human pathogenic bacteria including gram-positive (streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. in addition, we also demonstrated anticancer activity of these nanoparticles in vitro against human breast cancer cell line (mcf 7) using mtt, nuclear morphology assay, western blot and rt-pcr expression. these results taken together show the  potential applications of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using s. trilobatum fruits.

TI  == biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using ethanolic petals extract of rosa indica and characterization of its antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == the present study was aimed at biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (agnps) using ethanolic extract of rose (rosa indica) petals and testing their potential antibacterial activity using selective human pathogenic microbes, anticancer activity using human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line hct 15 as well as anti-inflammatory activity using rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. the biologically synthesized agnps were also characterized by uv-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx) and x-ray diffraction (xrd). the characterized agnps showed an effective antibacterial activity against gram negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae) than gram positive (streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis) bacteria. mtt assay, analysis of nuclear morphology, mrna expression of bcl-2, bax and protein expression of caspase 3 as well as 9, indicated potential anticancer activity. in addition, green synthesized agnps also attenuated cytotoxicity, nuclear morphology and free radical generation (o2(-) and no) by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. the results of our study show the potential green synthesis of silver nanoparticles in mitigating their toxicity while retaining their antibacterial activities.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency  and drug release of microparticles were determined. the antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli). it was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. in vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by fickian diffusion. both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. moreover, the results showed that the strains of e. faecalis, s. pyogenes and s.  mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and e. faecalis to the metronidazole. it was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than  in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. these microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == streptococcus mutans glnk protein: an unusual pii family member.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a gram-positive bacterium present in the oral cavity, and is considered to be one of the leading causes of dental caries. s. mutans has a glnk gene, which codes for a pii-like protein that is possibly involved in the integration of carbon, nitrogen and energy metabolism in several organisms. to characterize the glnk protein of s. mutans, the glnk gene was amplified by pcr, and cloned into the expression vectors pet29a(+) and pet28b(+). the native glnk-sm was purified by anion exchange (q-sepharose) and affinity (hi-trap heparin) chromatography. the glnk-his-sm protein was purified using a hi-trap chelating-ni2+ column. the molecular mass of the glnk-his-sm proteins was 85 kda  as determined by gel filtration, indicating that this protein is a hexamer in solution. the glnk-his-sm protein is not uridylylated by the escherichia coli glnd protein. the activities of the glnk-sm and glnk-his-sm proteins were assayed in e. coli constitutively expressing the klebsiella pneumoniae nifla operon. in k. pneumoniae, nifl inhibits nifa activity in the presence of high ammonium levels and the glnk protein is required to reduce the inhibition of nifl in the presence of low ammonium levels. the glnk-sm protein was unable to reduce nifl inhibition of nifa protein. surprisingly, the glnk-his-sm protein was able to partially reduce nifl inhibition of the nifa protein under nitrogen-limiting conditions, in a manner similar to the glnk protein of e. coli. these results suggested that s. mutans glnk is functionally different from e. coli pii proteins.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == proposal of protocols using d-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2h-tetrazolium hydroxide (xtt) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  == due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. one reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. xtt presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. however, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. this study evaluated the effectiveness of d-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (tac), as inducer of xtt reduction. the metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc(r)27853,  klebsiella pneumoniae atcc(r)13883, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc(r)12228, streptococcus mutans atcc(r)25175, and candida albicans sc5314 were evaluated. results showed that d-glutamine 50 mm (for p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. epidermidis) and 25 mm (for s. mutans and c. albicans) may enhance the detection  of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the xtt reduction assay more robust.

TI  == light insensitive silver(i) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
AB  == ten silver(i) cyanoximates of agl composition (l = nc-c(no)-r, where r is electron withdrawing groups: -cn, -c(o)nr(2), -c(o)r' (alkyl), -c(o)oet, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and x-ray analysis. crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2d) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. in these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. all studied agl complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees c. synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and uv-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and ag(i) centers. all 10 silver(i) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject  of their antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus hirae, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus  aureus, and mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of agl in dmf. results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. a combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(i) cyanoximates for medical applications. these include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by uv-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm  formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium citrate against streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study is to assess the antibacterial activity of sodium citrate against streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria. methods and results: the antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution method. the results showed that although enterocuccus faecium ob7084 and klebsiella pneumoniae ob7088 had high tolerance to sodium citrate, several oral bacteria including fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532(t) , streptococcus mutans jcm5705(t) and strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) were susceptible. furthermore, the bactericidal activity of sodium citrate against strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) was not influenced by ph in the range of 5.0-8.0, whereas that of sodium lactate  was weakened at neutral or weak alkaline ph. when strep. pneumoniae nbrc102642(t) was treated with sodium citrate for 2 h, many burst cells were observed. however, addition of mgcl(2) or cacl(2) to an assay medium weakened the antimicrobial activity although zncl(2) or mncl(2) did not influence. conclusions: independent  of ph, sodium citrate inhibited the growth of oral bacteria, which suggests that  the mechanism is different from that of sodium lactate. significance and impact of the study: the results presented in this study would be available for understanding the antimicrobial property of sodium citrate.

TI  == increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  == objectives: this study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. methods: opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. results: more opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (p < 0.05). opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. conclusions: the isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (mdr) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  == antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (mdr) strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans. atcc strains of streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus bovis, pseudimonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and candida albicans were also tested. the strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. the mdr strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of acacia nilotica,  syzygium aromaticum and cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of terminalia arjuna and eucalyptus globulus. community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. the most potent antimicrobial plant was a. nilotica (mic range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher mic values than a. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. this study concludes  that a. nilotica, c. zeylanicum and s. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.

TI  == in vitro reconstitution of antimicrobial pathogen activity by expressed recombinant bovine lactoferrin n-terminal peptide in escherichia coli.
AB  == recombinant bovine lactoferrin n-terminal polypeptide (rblf-n) escherichia coli expression system was constructed and the rblf-n antimicrobial activity was displayed by enzymatic proteolysis in this study. a 162 bp 5'-terminal fragment of bovine lactoferrin (blf) gene from bovine liver gdna was amplified by pcr. the dna fragment containing exon-2 of the blf gene was cloned into the expression vector pgex-4t1 and the glutathione-s-transferase-rblf-n (gst-rblf-n) fusion protein was obtained by over-expression in esch. coli bl21(de3). after thrombin/pepsin digestion, the rblf-n was released from the fusion protein. the recombinant peptide was separated and identified by sds-page, hplc and lc-ms/ms analysis. a very strong anti-food-born microbial pathogen activity of the rblf-n  peptides was displayed through bio- and kinetic-assays in vitro. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the rblf-n peptide for bacterial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, esch. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were 11.7, 11.7, 11.7, 23.4 microg and 23.4, 11.7, 11.7, 46.4 microg, respectively. this study created a new route for exploring lactoferrin peptide application in food science.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of substance p and neuropeptide y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
AB  == infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically substance p and neuropeptide y. since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. neuropeptide y and substance p had antimicrobial activity against e. coli (mic 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml  sem and 71.5+/-15 sem microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (mic>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  (mic>500 microg/ml). while substance p and neuropeptide y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. however, this remains to be determined.

TI  == mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses  were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  == in the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different gram-positive bacteria. it inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/ml which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. it functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. the antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against  both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of streptococcus sobrinus 6715 scra and scrb, which encode sucrose-specific enzyme ii of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system and sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, respectively, have been determined. these two genes were transcribed divergently, and the initiation codons of the two open reading frames were 192 bp apart. the transcriptional initiation sites were determined by primer extension analysis, and the putative promoter regions of these two genes overlapped partially. the gene encoding enzyme iiscr, scra, contained 1,896 nucleotides, and the molecular mass of the predicted protein was 66,529 da. the hydropathy plot of the predicted amino acid  sequence indicated that enzyme iiscr was a relatively hydrophobic protein. the gene encoding sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, scrb, contained 1,437 nucleotides. the molecular mass of the predicted protein was 54,501 da, and the encoded enzyme was hydrophilic. the predicted amino acid sequences of the two open reading frames exhibited approximately 45 and 70% identity with those encoded by scra and scrb, respectively, from streptococcus mutans gs5. homology also was observed between the n-terminal region of the s. sobrinus 6715 enzyme iiscr and other enzyme iis specific for the glucopyranoside molecule, all of which generate glucopyranoside-6-phosphate during translocation and phosphorylation of the respective substrates. the sequence of the c-terminal domain of the s. sobrinus 6715 enzyme iiscr shared significant homology with enzyme iiiglc from escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium and with the c-terminal domain of enzyme iibgl from e. coli, indicating that the two functional domains, enzyme iiscr and enzyme iiiscr, were covalently linked as a single polypeptide in s. sobrinus 6715. the deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product of s. sobrinus scrb shared strong homology with sucrase from bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and vibrio alginolyticus, suggesting conservation based on the physiological roles of these  proteins.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a salmonella plasmid cloned in  escherichia coli k12.
AB  == the sucrose operon from pur400, a 78-kbp conjugative salmonella plasmid, was cloned in escherichia coli k12. the operon was located in a 5.7-kbp sali restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector puc18. the insert dna was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease bal31. cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. the scra (enzyme iiscr) and scrr (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp smai-sali dna fragment and were assigned the order scrb, scra, scrr. an amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. this protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 m sodium chloride, 2% triton x-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. the protein did not appear to be the product of either the scra, scrb, or scrr gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. a new gene, scrc, is proposed. in addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp sali and 2.5-kbp smai-sali dna fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal dna from bacillus subtilis, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to dna from a sucrose plasmid from salmonella tennessee. however, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp ecori restriction fragment from klebsiella pneumoniae.

AB  == to determine the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 14 patients (7 males, 7 females)  with 16 gram-negative infective episodes (12 escherichia coli and 4 klebsiella pneumoniae) were treated with aztreonam infusions at doses of 1 gm per 8 hr for a planned 14-day period. ages ranged from 40 to 75 years with a mean of 57 +/- 10 years. all organisms were highly susceptible to aztreonam (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms per ml). serum antibiotic levels were 61.9 +/- 25.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 27 +/- 18.5 micrograms per ml (trough). ascitic fluid antibiotic levels were 33.6 +/- 22.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 32.7 +/- 16.8 micrograms per ml (trough). although the symptoms of infection were controlled within 3 days and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr, 10 patients (62.5%) died, with hepatorenal  syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage as the principal causes of death. three patients developed streptococcal superinfections during treatment; streptococcus  faecalis peritonitis in one case and spontaneous bacteremia due to streptococcus  equinus and streptococcus mutans in the other two. aztreonam was well tolerated and clinically and bacteriologically efficacious in controlling the infection. serum and ascitic fluid levels were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative organisms, suggesting that lower doses may achieve suitable therapeutic levels. a negative aspect of the antibiotic therapy was the superinfections. the high mortality rate was attributable to the  generally poor underlying condition of the patients.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
