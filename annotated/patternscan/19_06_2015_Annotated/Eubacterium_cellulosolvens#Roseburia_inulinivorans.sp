TI  == transfer of conjugative elements from rumen and human firmicutes bacteria to roseburia inulinivorans.
AB  == studies on firmicutes bacteria from the gut are hampered by a lack of gene transfer systems. here the human colonic anaerobe roseburia inulinivorans a2-194  was shown to be a transfer recipient for two conjugative transposons, tn1545 from eubacterium cellulosolvens and tnk10 from clostridium saccharolyticum k10.
