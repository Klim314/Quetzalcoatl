TI  == identification and characterization of the fis operon in enteric bacteria.
AB  == the small dna binding protein fis is involved in several different biological processes in escherichia coli. it has been shown to stimulate dna inversion reactions mediated by the hin family of recombinases, stimulate integration and excision of phage lambda genome, regulate the transcription of several different  genes including those of stable rna operons, and regulate the initiation of dna replication at oric. fis has also been isolated from salmonella typhimurium, and  the genomic sequence of haemophilus influenzae reveals its presence in this bacteria. this work extends the characterization of fis to other organisms. very  similar fis operon structures were identified in the enteric bacteria klebsiella  pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, erwinia carotovora, and proteus vulgaris but not in several nonenteric bacteria. we found that the deduced amino acid sequences for fis are 100% identical in k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, e. coli, and s. typhimurium and 96 to 98% identical when e. carotovora and p. vulgaris fis are considered. the deduced amino acid sequence for h. influenzae fis is about 80% identical and 90% similar to fis in enteric bacteria. however, in spite of these  similarities, the e. carotovora, p. vulgaris, and h. influenzae fis proteins are  not functionally identical. an open reading frame (orf1) preceding fis in e. coli is also found in all these bacteria, and their deduced amino acid sequences are also very similar. the sequence preceding orf1 in the enteric bacteria showed a very strong similarity to the e. coli fis p region from -53 to +27 and the region around -116 containing an ihf binding site. both beta-galactosidase assays and primer extension assays showed that these regions function as promoters in vivo and are subject to growth phase-dependent regulation. however, their promoter strengths vary, as do their responses to fis autoregulation and integration host  factor stimulation.

TI  == the rna molecule csrb binds to the global regulatory protein csra and antagonizes its activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == the rna-binding protein csra (carbon storage regulator) is a new kind of global regulator, which facilitates specific mrna decay. a recombinant csra protein containing a metal-binding affinity tag (csra-h6) was purified to homogeneity and authenticated by n-terminal sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and other studies. this protein was entirely contained within a globular complex of approximately 18 csra-h6 subunits and a single approximately 350-nucleotide rna, csrb. cdna cloning and nucleotide sequencing revealed that the csrb gene is located downstream from syd in the 64-min region of the escherichia coli k-12 genome and  contains no open reading frames. the purified csra-csrb ribonucleoprotein complex was active in regulating glg (glycogen biosynthesis) gene expression in vitro, as was the rna-free form of the csra protein. overexpression of csrb enhanced glycogen accumulation in e. coli, a stationary phase process that is repressed by csra. thus, csrb rna is a second component of the csr system, which binds to csra and antagonizes its effects on gene expression. a model for regulatory interactions in csr is presented, which also explains previous observations on the homologous system in erwinia carotovora. a highly repeated nucleotide sequence located within predicted stem-loops and other single-stranded regions of csrb, cagga(u/a/c)g, is a plausible csra-binding element.
