TI  - Intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: A systematic review.
AB  - Evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. Although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. Therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. Twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. In the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of Firmicutes; a higher count of Bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, and Lactobacillus. In the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of Bacteroides; a lower count of Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Clostridium; a higher prevalence of B. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of B. catenulatum and Staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis and toxigenic Clostridium difficile in a Taipei emergency department.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) and toxin-encoding Clostridium difficile (TXCD) are associated with gastroenteritis. Routine anaerobic blood culture for recovery of these anaerobic pathogens is not used for the detection of their toxins, especially for toxin-variant TXCD. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of the genotypes of these anaerobes in patients with acute diarrheal illnesses. METHODS: The data and samples of 513 patients with gastroenteritis were collected in a Taipei emergency department from March 1, 2006 to December 31, 2009. Nonenterotoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF) and ETBF and the toxin genotypes of TXCD were detected by molecular methods. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of NTBF, ETBF, and TXCD infections were 33.14%, 1.56%, and 2.34%, respectively. ETBF infections often occurred in the elderly (average age = 67.13 years) and during the cold, dry winters. TXCD infections were widely distributed in age and often occurred in the warm, wet springs and summers. The symptoms of ETBF-infected patients were significantly more severe than those of NTBF-infected patients. CONCLUSION: This study identified and analyzed the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical presentations of these anaerobic infections. Future epidemiologic and clinical studies are needed to understand the role of ETBF and TXCD in human gastroenteritis.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against clinical anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro anti-anaerobic activity and spectrum of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against 375 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria, including Gram-negative bacilli (181 strains), Gram-negative cocci (11 strains), Gram-positive bacilli (139 strains) and Gram-positive cocci (44 strains), covering 34 species. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levornidazole, its five metabolites and three comparators against these anaerobic isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of levornidazole and metronidazole were measured against 22 strains of Bacteroides fragilis. Levornidazole showed good activity against B. fragilis, other Bacteroides spp., Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus magnus, evidenced by MIC90 values of 0.5, 1, 0.25, 2 and 1mg/L, respectively. The activity of levornidazole and the comparators was poor for Veillonella spp. Generally, levornidazole displayed activity similar to or slightly higher than that of metronidazole, ornidazole and dextrornidazole against anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive bacilli and Gram-positive cocci, especially B. fragilis. Favourable anti-anaerobic activity was also seen with levornidazole metabolites M1 and M4 but not M2, M3 or M5. For the 22 clinical B. fragilis strains, MBC50 and MBC90 values of levornidazole were 2mg/L and 4mg/L, respectively. Both MBC50/MIC50 and MBC90/MIC90 ratios of levornidazole were 4, similar to those of metronidazole. Levornidazole is an important anti-anaerobic option in clinical settings in terms of its potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity, bactericidal property, and the anti-anaerobic activity of its metabolites M1 and M4.
TI  - The intestinal microbiota composition and weight development in children: the KOALA Birth Cohort Study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in early  infancy is associated with subsequent weight development in children. METHODS: Analyses were conducted within the KOALA Birth Cohort Study (n = 2834). This cohort originates from two recruitments groups: pregnant women with a conventional lifestyle (no selection based on lifestyle) and pregnant women recruited through alternative channels (organic shops, anthroposophic clinicians/midwives, Steiner schools and relevant magazines). From 909 one-month-old infants, fecal samples were collected and analyzed by quantitative PCR targeting bifidobacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Lactobacilli and total bacteria counts. Between the ages of 1 and 10 years, parent-reported weight and height was collected at 7 time points. Age- and gender-standardized body mass index (BMI) z-scores were calculated. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation. RESULTS: Colonization with B. fragilis group was borderline significantly associated with a higher BMI z-score of 0.15 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.02 to 0.31), in the conventional subcohort. After stratification for fiber intake (P(forinteraction) = 0.003), colonization with B. fragilis group was associated with a 0.34 higher BMI z-score among children with a low-fiber intake in this subcohort (95% CI: 0.17-0.53). Higher counts among colonized children were positively associated with BMI z-score only in children within the conventional subcohort and a high-fiber diet (BMI z-score 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01-0.14), but inversely associated in children with a low-fiber diet (BMI z-score -0.05; 95% CI: -0.10 to 0.00), and in children recruited through alternative channels (BMI z-score -0.10; 95% CI: -0.17 to -0.03). The other bacteria were not associated with BMI z-scores, regardless of subcohort. CONCLUSION: Using a targeted approach, we conclude that the intestinal microbiota, particularly the B. fragilis group, is associated with childhood weight development. To identify the potential impact of additional bacterial taxa, further prospective studies applying an unconstrained in-depth characterization of the microbiota are needed.
TI  - Activity of the investigational fluoroquinolone finafloxacin and seven other antimicrobial agents against 114 obligately anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of finafloxacin against 73 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, 10 other Gram-negative anaerobic rods and 31 Clostridium difficile strains was determined by the broth microdilution technique. The activity was compared with that of moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole. MIC(50/90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration, in mug/mL, at which 50% and 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited, respectively) for finafloxacin for the different species were determined: B. fragilis group, 0.5/2; other Gram-negative rods, 0.06/0.25; and C. difficile, 4/16. Furthermore, the MICs against 11 selected B. fragilis strains were determined under acidic conditions and resulted in MIC(50/90) values for finafloxacin of 0.25/4 mug/mL. Thus, finafloxacin shows promising activity against several pathogenic species of anaerobes. Furthermore, finafloxacin has increased activity against selected B. fragilis strains under acidic conditions compared with activity at neutral pH.
TI  - Efficacy of surotomycin in an in vitro gut model of Clostridium difficile infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated the efficacy of the cyclic lipopeptide surotomycin in treating clindamycin-induced Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) using an in vitro gut model. METHODS: Two three-stage chemostat gut models were inoculated with human faeces, spiked with C. difficile spores ( approximately 10(7) cfu/mL, PCR ribotype 027 or 001). Clindamycin (33.9 mg/L, four times daily for 7 days) was dosed to induce CDI. Following high-level toxin production, surotomycin (250 mg/L, twice daily for 7 days) was instilled. Microflora populations, C. difficile vegetative cells and spores, cytotoxin titres and antimicrobial levels (LC-MS/MS and bioassay) were determined. The emergence of C. difficile and enterococci with reduced susceptibility to surotomycin was monitored on breakpoint agar (4 x MIC). RESULTS: Counts of viable C. difficile were reduced to near the limit of detection on Days 1 and 3 of surotomycin instillation, and cytotoxin was undetectable on Days 3 and 4 of surotomycin instillation in the 027 and 001 models, respectively. Recurrence of vegetative growth and toxin production occurred 11 days (001 model) and 15 days (027 model) after surotomycin instillation had ceased, and remained for the duration of the experiment. Surotomycin instillation decreased populations of bifidobacteria, clostridia, enterococci and lactobacilli, but was sparing of Bacteroides fragilis group populations. All enumerated organisms had recovered to steady-state levels by 3 weeks post-surotomycin instillation. No evidence of the emergence of reduced susceptibility to surotomycin was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Surotomycin successfully reduced C. difficile vegetative cell counts and toxin levels in the gut model and was sparing of B. fragilis group populations. There was no evidence of decreased susceptibility to surotomycin during exposure or post-exposure.
TI  - Design and in vitro evaluation of a novel poly(methacrylic acid)/metronidazole antibacterial nanogel as an oral dosage form.
AB  - To overcome the undesirable side-effects of metronidazole (MTZ), ethylene glycol  dimethacrylate is used as the cross-linker, and a series of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) nanogels were prepared to load the MTZ. We investigated the morphology, size, in vitro release property in the simulated gastrointestinal medium, long-term antibacterial performance against Bacteroides fragilis, cytotoxicity, stability and activity of this novel MTZ/PMAA nanogel. The results indicate that the MTZ/PMAA nanogel sustained the release of MTZ in long-term antibacterial activity in the simulated gastrointestinal medium. This MTZ/PMAA nanogel exhibits less cytotoxicity than MTZ alone, suggesting that MTZ/PMAA nanogel is a more useful dosage form than MTZ for mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile infections. The novel aspects of this study include the synthesis of a nanogel and the three-phase study of the release profile, which might be useful for other researchers in this field.
TI  - Influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B Streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-Streptococcus activity of Bifidobacterium strains.
AB  - Several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. Among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group B Streptococcus (GBS)-positive women. This work is therefore aimed at verifying whether IAP can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. Fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to GBS (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to GBS and subjected to IAP with ampicillin (IAP group). Selected microbial groups (Lactobacillus spp., Bidobacterium spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time PCR on DNA extracted from newborn feces. Further analysis was performed within the Bidobacterium genus by using DGGE after amplification with genus-specific primers. Results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. Bifidobacteria were found to be affected by IAP not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. In fact, IAP determined a decrement in the frequency of Bidobacterium breve, Bidobacterium bifidum, and Bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. Moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against GBS and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of GBS infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of cadazolid against clinically relevant Clostridium difficile  isolates and in an in vitro gut model of C. difficile infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated the in vitro activity of cadazolid against 100 Clostridium difficile isolates and its efficacy in a simulated human gut model of C. difficile infection (CDI). METHODS: MICs of cadazolid, metronidazole, vancomycin, moxifloxacin and linezolid were determined using agar incorporation for 100 C. difficile isolates, including 30 epidemic strains (ribotypes 027, 106 and 001) with reduced metronidazole susceptibility, 2 linezolid-resistant isolates and 2 moxifloxacin-resistant isolates. We evaluated the efficacy of two cadazolid dosing regimens (250 versus 750 mg/L twice daily for 7 days) to treat simulated CDI. Microflora populations, C. difficile total viable counts and spores, cytotoxin titres, possible emergence of cadazolid, linezolid or quinolone resistance, and antimicrobial concentrations were monitored throughout. RESULTS: Cadazolid was active against all (including linezolid- and moxifloxacin-resistant) C. difficile strains (MIC90 0.125, range 0.03-0.25 mg/L). The cadazolid geometric mean MIC was 152-fold, 16-fold, 9-fold and 7-fold lower than those of moxifloxacin, linezolid, metronidazole and vancomycin, respectively. Both cadazolid dosing regimens rapidly reduced C. difficile viable counts and cytotoxin with no evidence of recurrence. Cadazolid levels persisted at 50-100-fold supra-MIC for 14 days post-dosing. Cadazolid inhibition of enumerated gut microflora was limited, with the exception of bifidobacteria; Bacteroides fragilis group and Lactobacillus spp. counts were unaffected. There was no evidence for selection of strains resistant to cadazolid, quinolones or linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: Cadazolid activity was greater than other tested antimicrobials against 100 C. difficile strains. Cadazolid effectively treated simulated CDI in a gut model, with limited impact on the enumerated gut microflora and no signs of recurrence or emergence of resistance within the experimental timeframe.
TI  - Expanded therapeutic potential in activity space of next-generation 5-nitroimidazole antimicrobials with broad structural diversity.
AB  - Metronidazole and other 5-nitroimidazoles (5-NI) are among the most effective antimicrobials available against many important anaerobic pathogens, but evolving resistance is threatening their long-term clinical utility. The common 5-NIs were developed decades ago, yet little 5-NI drug development has since taken place, leaving the true potential of this important drug class unexplored. Here we report on a unique approach to the modular synthesis of diversified 5-NIs for broad exploration of their antimicrobial potential. Many of the more than 650 synthesized compounds, carrying structurally diverse functional groups, have vastly improved activity against a range of microbes, including the pathogenic protozoa Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis, and the bacterial pathogens Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis. Furthermore, they can overcome different forms of drug resistance, and are active and nontoxic in animal infection models. These findings provide impetus to the development of structurally diverse, next-generation 5-NI drugs as agents in the antimicrobial armamentarium, thus ensuring their future viability as primary therapeutic agents against many clinically important infections.
TI  - Growth-Inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. METHOD: A microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the test materials against the organisms. RESULTS: delta-3-Carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689, Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 0.18-0.70 mg/mL) except for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 (MIC, 2.94 mg/mL). The MIC of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/mL against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against C. difficile (0.70 mg/mL); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/mL) and 4 (5.80 mg/mL) against C. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/mL), 4 (12.0 mg/mL), and 7 (0.70 mg/mL) against C. perfringens); compound 1 against E. coli (7.20 mg/mL) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (12.0 mg/mL). Overall, all of the constituents were less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.063-0.25 mg/ mL). The lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium Clostridium butyricum ATCC 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (B. fragilis and E. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. Beneficial Gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful Gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria was not observed. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. CONCLUSION: A. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - The correlation between Clostridium-difficile infection and human gut concentrations of Bacteroidetes phylum and clostridial species.
AB  - We aimed to assess differences in bacterial intensities of Bacteroidetes phylum and different clostridial species in the human intestines with respect to C. difficile infection. Patients with a stool assay for C. difficile toxin were identified via the microbiology laboratory in our institute. Bacterial populations were quantified from stool samples of four groups of patients: Group I-patients with C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD); Group II-asymptomatic C. difficile carriers; Group III-patients with non-C. difficile diarrhea; Group IV-patients with no diarrhea and negative stool samples for the C. difficile toxin (control group). Stool was examined for three genes-C. difficile toxin A gene, 16S rRNA gene from Clostridium thermocellum representing other clostridial species, and 16S rRNA gene from Bacteroides fragilis representing the Bacteroidetes phylum. Fifty-nine patients underwent analysis of the stool (CDAD group 14, carriers group 14, non-C. difficile diarrhea group 16, control group 15). C. difficile concentration was highest in the CDAD group, followed by the carriers group. Higher concentrations of both clostridial species and Bacteriodetes were observed in the control and non-C. difficile diarrhea groups compared to the CDAD and carriers groups. We demonstrated an inverse association between infection with C. difficile and the abundance of Bacteroidetes phylum and other clostridial species in human intestines. Studies with larger samples and broader diagnostic procedures are needed in order to better explore and understand this association.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - [Assessment of susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria originated from different sources to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the past 20 years, several studies at a national level in different countries followed resistance trends for Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium difficile. This study analysed antimicrobial susceptibility 73 anaerobic bacteria strains of Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) and C. difficile to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs. METHODS: The strictly anaerobes strains isolated in different hospitals were sent to the Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical Uniwersity of Warsaw, where species determination was carried out with the API20 ANA (bioMerieux SA, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) system. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using E-test. RESULTS: The rates of high resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin of BFG was respectively 84% and 31% and among of C. difficile strains respectively 92% and 36%). The percentage of BFG strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin were respectively 84% and 46%. The percentage of C. difficile strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin was 52%. Reduced level of susceptibility of BFG strains to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8%) was confirmed. Resistance to cefoxitin was 16% of BFG strains. All tested strains as well as BFG and C. difficile were susceptible to metronidazole. Was observed reduced leve (EUCAST) of susceptibility of C. difficile strains to vancomycin (13%). CONCLUSIONS. Increasing resistance to various antimicrobial agents is a significant problem in Poland. This demonstrate the need to continue with antibiotic resistance testing and surveys in anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of NVB302 versus vancomycin activity in an in vitro human gut model of Clostridium difficile infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: First-line treatment options for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are limited. NVB302 is a novel type B lantibiotic under evaluation for the treatment of CDI. We compared the responses to NVB302 and vancomycin when used to treat simulated CDI in an in vitro gut model. METHODS: We used ceftriaxone to elicit simulated CDI in an in vitro gut model primed with human faeces. Vancomycin and NVB302 were instilled into separate gut models and the indigenous gut microbiota and C. difficile total viable counts, spores and toxin levels were monitored throughout. RESULTS: Ceftriaxone instillation promoted C. difficile germination and high-level toxin production. Commencement of NVB302 and vancomycin instillation reduced C. difficile total viable counts rapidly with only C. difficile spores remaining within 3 and 4 days, respectively. Cytotoxin was reduced to undetectable levels 5 and 7 days after vancomycin and NVB302 instillation commenced in vessel 2 and 3, respectively, and remained undetectable for the remainder of the experiments. C. difficile spores were unaffected by the presence of vancomycin or NVB302. NVB302 treatment was associated with faster resolution of Bacteroides fragilis group. CONCLUSIONS: Both NVB302 and vancomycin were effective in treating simulated CDI in an in vitro gut model. C. difficile spore recrudescence was not observed following successful treatment with either NVB302 or vancomycin. NVB302 displayed non-inferiority to vancomycin in the treatment of simulated CDI, and had less deleterious effects against B. fragilis group. NVB302 warrants further clinical investigation as a potentially novel antimicrobial agent for the treatment of CDI.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - Nosocomial diarrhea: evaluation and treatment of causes other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. We review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. Clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. Apart from Clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined and test availability is limited. Here we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for C. difficile are negative.
TI  - Oxygen tolerance in anaerobic pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A prerequisite for successful identification of anaerobic pathogenic bacteria from samples of clinical material is the method of cultivation. Currently, several methods of cultivation in anaerobic environment are used: cultivation in anaerobic box, anaerobic jar, and in nonrecurring cultivation system. Here, we determined the suitability of the above methods of cultivation using the estimation of the growth (diameters of colony size) of commonly isolated anaerobic pathogens (Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium perfringens). The tested bacterial strains were exposed to atmospheric oxygen for various time periods and then they were cultivated using different anaerobic cultivation systems. Maximum growth differed, depending on the type of cultivation and the strain used. Thus, largest zone diameters, in the majority of measurements, were achieved in the anaerobic box. However, nonrecurring cultivation system seemed better in several cases; this applied to the cultivation of C. perfringens after 15, 30, and 60 min exposure to atmospheric oxygen as well as the cultivation of B. fragilis after 30 and 60 min of oxygen exposure. The cultivation in anaerobic box was the most convenient method for growth of C. difficile. In almost all cases, higher growth was observed in nonrecurring cultivation system than in the system of anaerobic jar. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed among these anaerobic cultivation systems which confirmed their applicability (taking into account some individual features concerning the optimization of cultivations) for identification of pathogenic anaerobes.
TI  - Comparative effects of the immediate and the extended release formulations of ciprofloxacin on normal human intestinal microflora.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a well-known fluoroquinolone, active in vitro against most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ecological effects of an orally administered extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin in comparison with an immediate-release formulation of ciprofloxacin on the normal human intestinal microflora. Thirty-six healthy female subjects were included in the study. the extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin was given as 500 mg once daily and the immediate-release formulation as 250 mg twice daily. The treatment period was 3 days. the microbiological investigation was blinded with respect to treatment. Mean fecal concentration in the volunteers receiving the extended-release formulation ciprofloxacin was 453 mg/kg and in the immediate-release formulation ciprofloxacin volunteers, the mean fecal concentration was 392 mg/kg. The numbers of Escherichia coli were significantly suppressed while the enterococci decreased moderately in both treatment groups. No toxigenic Clostridium difficile strains were found. No major differences were observed between the two studied formulations on the normal human intestinal microflora.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the colon: delivering a light punch to the  guts?
AB  - A paper in this issue of Photochemistry and Photobiology by Cassidy et al. describes the use of a sophisticated drug delivery vehicle prepared by the hot melt extrusion process to deliver photosensitizers to the colon. The smart vehicle protects its cargo through the acidic environment of the stomach but releases the active photosensitizers in the higher pH and anaerobic environment of the colon. The goal is to use photodynamic therapy (PDT) to destroy pathogenic microorganisms that can cause disease when they grow out of control in the colon. Since the colon is an environment with a low oxygen concentration the investigators also used tetrachlorodecaoxide, an oxygen donor to boost the available oxygen concentration. The paper reports results with Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis but the real medical problem demanding to be solved is Clostridium difficile that can cause intractable drug-resistant infections after antibiotic use. There still remain barriers to implementing this strategy in vivo, including light delivery to the upper colon, oxygen availability and optimizing the selectivity of photosensitizers for bacteria over colon epithelial cells. Nevertheless, this highly innovative paper lays the ground for the study of an entirely new and significant application for antimicrobial PDT.
TI  - Intestinal microbiota was assessed in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis B virus infection. Intestinal microbiota of HBV cirrhotic patients.
AB  - To unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in Chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis B virus (HBV), chronic hepatitis B, decompensated HBV cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative PCR and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium perfringens in fecal crude DNA and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. Data analysis indicated that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of HBV cirrhotic patients. The Bifidobacteria/Enterobacteriaceae (B/E) ratio, which may indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 +/- 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 +/- 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 +/- 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis B to 0.64 +/- 0.09 in patients with decompensated HBV cirrhosis (for all, P < 0.01). This suggests that B/E ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. The data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. Fecal secretory IgA and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in decompensated HBV cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Influence of early gut microbiota on the maturation of childhood mucosal and systemic immune responses.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Among sensitized infants, those with high, as compared with low levels, of salivary secretory IgA (SIgA) are less likely to develop allergic symptoms. Also, early colonization with certain gut microbiota, e.g. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium species, might be associated with less allergy development. Although animal and in vitro studies emphasize the role of the commensal gut microbiota in the development of the immune system, the influence of the gut microbiota on immune development in infants is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether early colonization with certain gut microbiota species associates with mucosal and systemic immune responses i.e. salivary SIgA and the spontaneous Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 mRNA expression and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine/chemokine responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 64 Swedish infants, followed prospectively up to 5 years of age. Bacterial DNA was analysed with real-time PCR using primers binding to Clostridium difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and Bacteroides fragilis. Saliva was collected at age 6 and 12 months and at 2 and 5 years and SIgA was measured with ELISA. The PBMCs, collected 12 months after birth, were analysed for TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression with real-time PCR. Further, the PBMCs were stimulated with LPS, and cytokine/chemokine responses were measured with Luminex. RESULTS: The number of Bifidobacterium species in the early fecal samples correlated significantly with the total levels of salivary SIgA at 6 months. Early colonization with Bifidobacterium species, lactobacilli groups or C. difficile did not influence TLR2 and TLR4 expression in PBMCs. However, PBMCs from infants colonized early with high amounts of Bacteroides fragilis expressed lower levels of TLR4 mRNA spontaneously. Furthermore, LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, e.g. IL-6 and CCL4 (MIP-1 beta), was inversely correlated to the relative amounts of Bacteroides fragilis in the early fecal samples. CONCLUSION: Bifidobacterial diversity may enhance the maturation of the mucosal SIgA system and early intense colonization with Bacteroides fragilis might down-regulate LPS responsiveness in infancy.
TI  - Surveillance and trends of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates of anaerobes in Kuwait hospitals from 2002 to 2007.
AB  - The susceptibility trends for all anaerobes processed by the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory against various antibiotics were determined by using data for 2557 isolates referred by all government hospitals in Kuwait from 2002 to 2007. MIC were determined for the following anti-anaerobic antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, imipenem, meropenem, metronidazole, penicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin (for Gram-positive anaerobes only), using E-test method. The commonest isolates were Bacteroides fragilis (36.8%), followed by Peptostreptococcus spp. (21.9%), Bacteroides ovatus (15.5%) and Prevotella bivia (12.1%). In addition, Prevotella oralis and other Bacteroides spp. represented 8.5% and 8.1% of total number of isolates, respectively. Resistance rate varied among the antimicrobial agents and the species tested. The beta-lactams, with the exception of penicillin, were the most active drugs. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the only antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were uniformly susceptible. Imipenem and metronidazole were highly active with resistance rate of only <5% recorded against most isolates. However, 42.8, 55.8 and 9.3% of Clostridium difficile isolates were resistant to imipenem, clindamycin and meropenem, respectively. It is noteworthy that from 2002 to 2007, there was a gradual increase in resistance rates to clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin among B. fragilis. Periodic surveillance of antibiotic resistance among the anaerobic bacteria is recommended as a guide to empiric antibiotic use and formulation of guideline for appropriate choice of antimicrobial therapy in anaerobic infections.
TI  - Activity of a novel carbapenem, doripenem, against anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - Doripenem, a synthetic 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, has a broad-spectrum of activity against almost all species of anaerobic bacteria, including all Bacteroides fragilis group species, most with MIC(90) results at <or=1 microg/mL (with the exception of Sutterella wadsworthensis). Against Clostridium difficile strains, it has a narrow range of inhibitory concentrations (1-4 microg/mL) that "may be achievable in the colon", potentially resulting in lower disease rates. It has been shown to be active in vitro against strains isolated from a variety of clinical infections, including bacteremias, diabetic foot and other soft tissues infections and in intra-abdominal and pelvic sites. In addition, a study of a pyometrium animal model of mixed infections noted a better microbiologic response than with imipenem. Two phase 3 multinational clinical trials of complicated mixed aerobic/anaerobic intra-abdominal infections noted "noninferiority" of doripenem when compared with meropenem, but in vitro against the anaerobes, it was "more potent than meropenem, ertapenem, ... and similar to imipenem". Doripenem activity against anaerobes seems comparable with the other extant carbapenems. Although resistance among anaerobic bacteria to this agent is possible, it remains relatively rare.
TI  - Altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years  of age.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while Clostridium (C.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. Previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. OBJECTIVE: To relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 Swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. Bacterial DNA was analysed with real-time PCR and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and Fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. Primers binding to C. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and Bacteroides fragilis were used. Children regarded as allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. RESULTS: Children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group I (Lactobacillus (L.) rhamnosus, L. casei, L. paracasei), Bifidobacterium adolescentis and C. difficile during their first 2 months. Infants colonized with several Bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. CONCLUSION: A more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy, family size and endotoxin exposure.
TI  - OPT-80 eliminates Clostridium difficile and is sparing of bacteroides species during treatment of C. difficile infection.
AB  - During a 10-day treatment for Clostridium difficile infection, OPT-80 and vancomycin were comparably effective in reducing C. difficile counts. Bacteroides fragilis group counts appeared unaffected with increasing dosages of OPT-80, whereas vancomycin was markedly suppressive. Retention of components of the normal microflora might lower the risk of recurrent disease.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - DC-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. DC-159a showed activity against Streptococcus spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Staphylococcus spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. Against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the MIC 90 of DC-159a was 8 microg/ml. DC-159a was the most active against Enterococcus spp. (MIC 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml) and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of DC-159a against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. The MICs of DC-159a against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and DC-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. DC-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DC-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. The bactericidal activity of DC-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. These activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with DC-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of hindgut bacteria associated with the development of equine laminitis.
AB  - Carbohydrate-induced laminitis in horses is characterized by marked changes in the composition of the hindgut microbiota, from a predominantly Gram-negative population to one dominated by Gram-positive bacteria. The objective of this study was to monitor changes in the relative abundance of selected hindgut bacteria that have previously been implicated in the pathophysiology of equine laminitis using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Caecal cannulae were surgically implanted in five Standardbred horses and laminitis induced by oral administration of a bolus dose of oligofructose. Caecal fluid and faecal specimens were collected over a 48 h period at 2 to 4 h intervals post-oligofructose administration and subjected to FISH using probes specific for nine bacterial groups to determine changes in their relative abundance compared with total bacteria hybridizing to the generic EUBMIX probe. Additionally, hoof biopsies were taken over the course of the experiment at 6 h intervals and evaluated for histopathological changes consistent with laminitis, allowing changes in hindgut microbiota to be correlated with the onset of lesions in the foot. Of the microorganisms specifically targeted, streptococci of the Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex were the only bacteria that consistently proliferated in both caecal fluid and faeces immediately before the onset of histological signs of laminitis. Furthermore, lactobacilli, Enterobacteriaceae, Allisonella histaminiformans, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Mitsuokella jalaludinii and Clostridium difficile did not establish significant populations in the hindgut before the onset of equine laminitis.
TI  - In vitro activity against anaerobes of retapamulin, a new topical antibiotic for  treatment of skin infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated  as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. METHODS: The in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by the CLSI reference agar dilution method (M11-A6). RESULTS: Ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the Bacteroides fragilis group. Despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the B. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other Gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/L or less. All the investigated strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/L retapamulin. Three strains of C. difficile and one strain of C. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. Based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against Propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: At <or=2 mg/L, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. The broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. Pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.
TI  - Antianaerobe activity of ceftobiprole, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Agar dilution testing of 463 anaerobes showed most Gram-positive beta-lactamase-negative strains (other than some Clostridium difficile and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), as well as both beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, to have ceftobiprole MIC values of < or =0.016 to 4 microg/mL. Ceftobiprole was less active against beta-lactamase-positive Gram-negative bacilli, especially the members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Like ceftobiprole, piperacillin was active mainly against beta-lactamase-negative strains, though MIC values for piperacillin were often 1 to 2 dilutions higher than for ceftobiprole. Carbapenems had MIC values < or =4 microg/L against all except some C. difficile and 2 strains of B. fragilis. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole, and all bacteria, except C. difficile and a single Bacteroides distasonis strain, were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Clindamycin resistance was seen in most anaerobe groups, whereas high moxifloxacin MICs were found mainly among the B. fragilis and Prevotella groups, and a few C. difficile and F. nucleatum strains.
TI  - Clostridium difficile and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from patients with antibiotic associated diarrhoea.
AB  - From the fecal samples of 332 patients with a clinical diagnosis of antibiotic associated diarrhoea (AAD), 131 Clostridium difficile strains were isolated. For detection of toxin A in the isolated strains the enzymatic immunoassay was used. The cytopathic effect was determined on McCoy cell line. PCR was used for the detection of non-repeating and repeating sequences of toxin A gene and non-repeating sequences of toxin B gene. One hundred and six isolated C. difficile strains were TcdA(+)TcdB(+), 10 strains TcdA(-)TcB(+) and 15 were non-toxigenic TcdA(-)TcdB(-). Out of the same fecal samples 50 Bacteroides fragilis strains were isolated. All B. fragilis strains were tested in PCR reaction for fragilysine gene detection (bft). In 9 strains (18%) this gene was detected and the strains could be assumed as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF). In 4 fecal samples toxigenic C. difficile (TcdA(+)TcdB(+)) was found simultaneously with ETBF. One sample contained C. difficile (TcdA(-)TcdB(+)) and ETBF. Out of 4 fecal samples only ETBF was isolated. The cytotoxicity of ETBF strains was tested on HT29/C1 human colon carcinoma cell line. The cytotoxicity titer in the range of 20 and 80 was observed.
TI  - Factors influencing the composition of the intestinal microbiota in early infancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of a broad range of external influences to the gut microbiotic composition in early infancy. METHODS: Fecal samples from 1032 infants at 1 month of age, who were recruited from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study in the Netherlands, were subjected to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for the enumeration of bifidobacteria, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis group, lactobacilli, and total bacterial counts. Information on potential determinants of the gut microbiotic composition was collected with repeated questionnaires. The associations between these factors and the selected gut bacteria were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Infants born through cesarean section had lower numbers of bifidobacteria and Bacteroides, whereas they were more often colonized with C difficile, compared with vaginally born infants. Exclusively formula-fed infants were more often colonized with E coli, C difficile, Bacteroides, and lactobacilli, compared with breastfed infants. Hospitalization and prematurity were associated with higher prevalence and counts of C difficile. Antibiotic use by the infant was associated with decreased numbers of bifidobacteria and Bacteroides. Infants with older siblings had slightly higher numbers of bifidobacteria, compared with infants without siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The most important determinants of the gut microbiotic composition in infants were the mode of delivery, type of infant feeding, gestational age, infant hospitalization, and antibiotic use by the infant. Term infants who were born vaginally at home and were breastfed exclusively seemed to have the most "beneficial" gut microbiota (highest numbers of bifidobacteria and lowest numbers of C difficile and E coli).
TI  - In vitro activities of tinidazole and metronidazole against Clostridium difficile, Prevotella bivia and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Tinidazole, a 5-nitroimidazole similar to metronidazole, was studied against 40 Clostridium difficile, 10 Prevotella bivia and 11 Bacteroides fragilis clinical isolates. The geometric mean MICs of tinidazole and metronidazole were, respectively: C. difficile, 0.31 and 0.28 microg/mL; P. bivia, 2.33 and 1.52 microg/mL; B. fragilis, 0.5 and 0.71 microg/mL.
TI  - Tinidazole: a nitroimidazole antiprotozoal agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tinidazole, a structural analogue of metrondazole, is an antiprotozoal agent that has been widely used in Europe and developing countries for >2 decades with established efficacy and acceptable tolerability. It was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties and clinical usefulness of tinidazole. METHODS: Relevant information was identified through a search of MEDLINE (1966-August 2005), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-August 2005), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-August 2005) using the terms tinidazole, Fasigyn, and nitroimidazole. RESULTS: In vitro, tinidazole exhibits activity against pathogenic protozoa (eg, Tricbomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba bistolytica, Giardia duodenalis), a wide range of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria (eg, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile), and the microaerophilic bacterium Helicobacter pylori. In susceptible protozoal and bacterial cells, tinidazole is reduced to cytotoxic intermediates that covalently bind to DNA, causing irreversible damage. In human adults, tinidazole had a bioavailability of 100% and a V(d) of 50.7 L, was minimally bound to plasma protein (12%), had a plasma elimination t((1/2)) of 12.3 hours, and was eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism (approximately 63%). Dose adjustment does not appear to be necessary on the basis of race, sex, or renal function. No data were found on the disposition of tinidazole in patients with hepatic insufficiency; therefore, use of tinidazole in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) is not recommended. Clinical cure rates in patients with trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess were generally >90%. In comparative trials, tinidazole was as effective as metronidazole in the treatment of trichomoniasis and was significantly more effective than metronidazole in the treatment of giardiasis (P < 0.05) and amebiasis (P < 0.05). The most commonly reported (>1%) adverse effects included bitter taste, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, vomiting, and fatigue. The recommended dosage of tinidazole is a single dose of 2 g for trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and 2 g/d for 3 to 5 days for amebiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Tinidazole appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of trichomoniasis, giardiasis, amebiasis, and amebic liver abscess. Clinical studies are needed to evaluate the use of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria and H pylori.
TI  - In vitro activities of doripenem and comparator agents against 364 anaerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activities of doripenem against 364 anaerobic isolates were measured and compared to those of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. All of the carbapenems were active against nearly all Bacteroides fragilis group isolates. Doripenem was either comparable to or slightly less active than imipenem and meropenem against most isolates but more active than the other penems against Clostridium difficile. Doripenem appears to have excellent activity against a broad range of anaerobes.
TI  - [The study of the pro-nucleating activity of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones in model bile systems].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. METHODS: Observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (NT). RESULTS: (1) Model bile were suitable for the growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and Clostridium. Propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of Bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) Only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enTerococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) With pseudomonas aeruginosa or enTerococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 Hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. The inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and Hp strains, and were method dependent. The cagA status of Hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. The success and progress of Hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating Hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of Hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. Hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. These results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
TI  - ["In vitro" activity of ten antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. A collaborative study, 1999-2002].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, clindamycin, metronidazole, and azitromycin was assesed against 166 strains of anaerobic bacteria recovered from eight hospitals in Buenos Aires. The strains studied were Bacteroides fragilis group (65), Fusobacterium spp. (26), Prevotella spp. (21), Porphyromonas spp. (10), Clostridium difficile (10), other clostridia (12), and gram-positive cocci (22). The MICs were determined by the agar dilution method according to NCCLS document M11-A5. Metronidazole and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active antimicrobial agents tested and exhibited MIC90 values of < or = 2 microg/ml and < or = 4 microg/ml against gram-negative organisms, and < or = 2 microg/ml, and < or = 8 microg/ml against gram-positive organisms, respectively. Among beta-lactams the activity against gram-negative rods was in the following order: imipenem > piperacillin > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. Among the gram-positive bacteria the decreased activity was: piperacillin > imipenem > cefoxitin > ceftriaxone > ampicillin. The majority of the species studied showed different degrees of resistance to clindamycin and azitromycin. Nevertheless, 90% of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas spp. isolates were inhibited by 0.125 mg/ml of clindamycin and azitromycin, respectively.
TI  - Microbial contamination of drinking water and disease outcomes in developing regions.
AB  - Drinking water is a major source of microbial pathogens in developing regions, although poor sanitation and food sources are integral to enteric pathogen exposure. Gastrointestinal disease outcomes are also more severe, due to under-nutrition and lack of intervention strategies in these regions. Poor water quality, sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide (3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all DALY's), mainly through infectious diarrhoea. Nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries. Major enteric pathogens in these children include: rotavirus, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp. and Vibrio cholerae O1, and possibly enteropathogenic E. coli, Aeromonas spp. V. cholerae O139, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile and Cryptosporidium parvum. All except the latter are easily control by chlorination of water, but recontamination of treated water is a huge problem. Emerging environmental pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori and Burkholderia pseudomallei, may well be of significance in some regions. In adults, much less is understood of various sequellae such as myocarditis, diabetes, reactive arthritis and cancers some months-years after initial infections. So in addition to the traditional pathogens (helminths, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia hepatitis A and E) various enteroviruses, C. jejuni and H. pylori are emerging issues in adults.
TI  - In vitro activities of a new des-fluoro(6) quinolone, garenoxacin, against clinical anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of garenoxacin and eight other antibiotics against 641 anaerobic isolates were evaluated with the NCCLS agar dilution method. Overall, the MICs of garenoxacin for 50 and 90% of the strains tested (in micrograms per milliliter) were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis group, 0.5 and 2; Prevotella spp., 0.25 and 2; Fusobacterium spp., 0.25 and 0.5; Porphyromonas spp., 0.125 and 0.25; Bilophila wadsworthia, 0.5 and 1; Veillonella spp., 0.25 and 0.5; Clostridium spp., 0.25 and 1; Clostridium difficile, 2 and >64; Bifidobacterium spp., 1 and 2; Eggerthella lenta, 0.25 and 1; Propionibacterium spp., 0.5 and 0.5; gram-positive cocci, 0.125 and 0.25.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of SMAP-29 against the Bacteroides fragilis group and clostridia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The cathelicidin-derived peptide SMAP-29 exerts rapid and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against aerobic bacteria and fungi. In this study, the effects of the peptide against the Bacteroides fragilis group, including antibiotic-resistant isolates, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile reference and clinical isolates, were investigated. METHODS: The microbicidal activity of SMAP-29 against eight reference and 100 clinical anaerobic strains from a national collection was assessed using a microdilution susceptibility assay, and by determining the killing kinetics on selected strains. The killing mechanism was investigated further by means of a two-colour fluorescent permeabilization assay, and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: The Bacteroides fragilis group, Clostridium reference strains and most clinical isolates were inhibited in vitro by 1-2 microM (3.2-6.4 mg/L) SMAP-29, and killed by 1.5- to 2-fold higher peptide concentrations. The anaerobic bacterial cells were 90%-100% permeabilized within 2 h of exposure to bactericidal concentrations of the peptide. The SEM images of bacteria exposed to SMAP-29 provide morphological evidence that the envelope is an important target of the bactericidal activity of this peptide. These results are consistent with earlier studies indicating that SMAP-29 kills aerobic bacteria with a membranolytic mechanism, and suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria share surface features that are targeted by this peptide. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that the spectrum of antibacterial activity of SMAP-29 includes the B. fragilis group and Clostridium species, and encourage further investigations of the therapeutic potential of this peptide.
TI  - Mechanism of quinolone resistance in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Several recently developed quinolones have excellent activity against a broad range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and are thus potential drugs for the treatment of serious anaerobic and mixed infections. Resistance to quinolones is increasing worldwide, but is still relatively infrequent among anaerobes. Two main mechanisms, alteration of target enzymes (gyrase and topoisomerase IV) caused by chromosomal mutations in encoding genes, or reduced intracellular accumulation due to increased efflux of the drug, are associated with quinolone resistance. These mechanisms have also been found in anaerobic species. High-level resistance to the newer broad-spectrum quinolones often requires stepwise mutations in target genes. The increasing emergence of resistance among anaerobes may be a consequence of previous widespread use of quinolones, which may have enriched first-step mutants in the intestinal tract. Quinolone resistance in the Bacteroides fragilis group strains is strongly correlated with amino acid substitutions at positions 82 and 86 in GyrA (equivalent to positions 83 and 87 of Escherichia coli). Several studies have indicated that B. fragilis group strains possess efflux pump systems that actively expel quinolones, leading to resistance. DNA gyrase seems also to be the primary target for quinolones in Clostridium difficile, since amino acid substitutions in GyrA and GyrB have been detected in resistant strains. To what extent other mechanisms, such as mutational events in other target genes or alterations in outer-membrane proteins, contribute to resistance among anaerobes needs to be further investigated.
TI  - In vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - By using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. Ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of Clostridium difficile for which MICs of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid MICs were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. Nineteen Clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin MIC at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. All strains of Eubacterium, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. Ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the Prevotella and Porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin MICs for all 31 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, the Fusobacterium mortiferum-Fusobacterium varium group, and Veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. Ramoplanin displays excellent activity against C. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of PH-027 versus linezolid and other anti-anaerobic antimicrobials against clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - PH-027 is a new 5-triazole oxazolidinone synthesized in our laboratories, which shows strong activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including clinical isolates. The objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro activity of this compound in comparison with linezolid and other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. The in vitro activity of PH-027 in comparison with those of linezolid and other antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 201 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by agar dilution and Etest methods. PH-027 showed excellent activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in the range of 0.12-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates; MIC90s being 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against Clostridium difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella bivia and Fusobacterium spp. respectively. In comparison, linezolid had MIC in the range of 0.5-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates, with MIC90s of 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against the same set of bacteria respectively. PH-027 demonstrated excellent in vitro activity that is superior to linezolid against Peptostreptococcus spp., B. fragilis and P. bivia. However, against C. difficile and Fusobacterium spp, PH-027 and linezolid showed comparable in vitro activity. Against all anaerobes, metronidazole, PH-027 and, to a lesser extent, linezolid had the most potent activity. From the results of in vitro susceptibility testing, both linezolid and PH-027 show promise in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Enteric flora and lymphocyte-derived cytokines determine expression of heat shock proteins in mouse colonic epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inducible heat shock proteins (hsps), particularly hsp25 and hsp72, are expressed by surface colonocytes and may have a role in protecting intestinal epithelial cells against injury. This study is aimed at determining if enteric bacteria and/or immune signals regulate their physiologic expression. METHODS: Intestinal hsp25, hsp72, and constitutive hsc73 expression were studied in immunodeficient RAG-1(-/-) mice and in normal mice. Mucosal permeability was measured by mannitol flux and transepithelial resistance. Hsp expression in intestinal YAMC cells was assessed after incubation with recombinant cytokines, activated lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs), or Bacteroides fragilis. RESULTS: Chronic metronidazole treatment decreases colonic mucosal hsp25 and hsp72 expression, an effect associated with increased susceptibility of mucosal barrier function to C. difficile toxin A. Hsp expression also was increased in YAMC cells incubated with B. fragilis, an effect mediated by lipopolysaccharide and other bacteria-derived factors. Colonic hsp72, but not hsp25 or hsc73, expression is decreased in RAG-1(-/-) mice. Recombinant IL-2 and other cytokines enhance YAMC hsp25 and/or hsp72 expression. Activated LPLs induce YAMC hsp expression, an effect blocked by IL-2 neutralizing antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Enteric flora and mucosal lymphocytes play a role in maintaining physiologic expression of colonocyte hsp25 and hsp72.
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
TI  - Characterization of Clostridium perfringens strains isolated from Polish patients with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our research was to investigate the role of enterotoxin- producing anaerobic bacteria other than Clostridium difficile in the etiology of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This article presents data related to C. perfringens. MATERIAL/METHODS: Stool samples taken from 158 patients with suspected antibiotic-associated diarrhea were specifically cultured for Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. In order to associate the presence of virulence factors in the bacterial isolates thus collected with disease features, all strains were genetically and phenotypically analyzed for toxin production. All isolated C. perfringens strains were cultured in Ellner sporulation-promoting medium. RESULTS: In 21 of the 158 patients (13%) C. perfringens could be cultivated from the fecal specimen. None of the strains produced enterotoxin, and consequently the cpe gene was not detected by PCR in any of these strains. C. perfringens and C. difficile were cultivated from the same stool samples in 4 cases. Interestingly, in one case toxin A-negative/toxin B positive C. difficile and non-enterotoxigenic C. perfringens were co-cultured. After application of a heat shock (100 degrees C at 30 min.) only two C. perfringens strains producing thermoresistant spores were detected. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) demonstrated genetic heterogenicity among the C. perfringens strains, suggesting that these bacteria were already presented upon hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: It seems unlikely that nosocomial transfer has taken place. The relatively low incidence suggests that C. perfringens is not a major primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
TI  - Antianaerobic activity of a cecropin---melittin peptide.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several small, 15-residue peptides that contain portions of the amino  acid sequences of both cecropin A and melittin have previously been shown to have broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against aerobic microorganisms, with no undesirable hemolytic properties. It would also be useful to know what effect these hybrid peptides have on anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of one hybrid, CA(1--7)M(2--9)NH2, were compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against 111 clinical anaerobic strains; Bacteroides fragilis, 24 strains; other Bacteroides fragilis group, 14 strains; other Bacteroides species, 13 strains; Fusobacterium nucleatum, six strains; Clostridium difficile, 22 strains; Clostridium perfringens, 10 strains, Propionibacterium spp., nine strains; and anaerobic cocci, 13 strains. RESULTS: Ninety per cent of strains belonging to the B. fragilis group, fusobacteria, propionibacteria and peptostreptococci were inhibited by 4 mg/L CA(1--7)M(2--9)NH2, and the antimicrobial activity was approximately in the same range as that of chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This investigation showed that the antimicrobial spectrum of this cecropin---melittin hybrid also includes anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Acute appendicitis: the role of enterotoxigenic strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a relationship between enterotoxin-producing B. fragilis strains and toxigenic C. difficile strains and the pathogenesis of acute appendicitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Post-appendectomy tissues from 34 patients with histopathologically confirmed phlegmonous or gangrenous appendicitis were studied. RESULTS: Among 86 anaerobes isolated, the B. fragilis group was most frequently isolated: 34 B. fragilis strains were cultured from 21 post-appendectomy tissues. Two enterotoxin-producing B. fragilis strains were found. Enterotoxin titers (1:10 and 1:160, respectively) were measured on HT29/C cells. The presence of the enterotoxin gene was confirmed by PCR in DNA extracted from both strains. Among 21 DNA samples isolated from those post-appendectomy tissues from which B. fragilis strains were cultured, the presence of the enterotoxin gene was confirmed in only one case (the corresponding B. fragilis strain enterotoxin titer was 1:160). A unique toxigenic C. difficile strain was also cultured from the tissue of an adult patient with gangrenous non-perforated appendicitis. The presence of toxin A and toxin B genes was confirmed by PCR in DNA extracted from the C. difficile strain, but these genes were not found in the DNA extracted from the corresponding tissue. CONCLUSION: The presence of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis and toxigenic C. difficile strains was shown in post-appendectomy tissue from patients with phlegmonous and gangrenous appendicitis, and the B. fragilis enterotoxin gene was detected directly in the corresponding tissue. Further investigations (including immunologic aspects) require to confirm the role of these toxins in pathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
TI  - In vitro activities of ertapenem (MK-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in Europe and Australia.
AB  - Ertapenem (MK-0826, L-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. Its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in Europe and Australia, with imipenem, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. Ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. Ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and Moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its MIC(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most Enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. Ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional NCCLS MIC breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them Enterobacter aerogenes. Resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 Bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 Clostridium difficile strain. Ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which MICs were as high as 2 microg/ml. Of 234 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem MICs of 2 microg/ml and one required an MIC of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-Streptococcus pyogenes, non-Streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem MICs of 2 and 16 microg/ml. These streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem. The Etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.
TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against 502 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In a previous study, we compared HMR 3004 with azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin against 502 anaerobic bacteria using NCCLS-approved procedures. This report extends this study by reporting the activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) against these strains. Telithromycin inhibited 10% of Bacteroides fragilis, 50% of other B. fragilis group organisms and 93% of other Bacteroides spp. Telithromycin inhibited all Porphyromonas spp. and 98% of Prevotella spp. Activity against Bilophila wadsworthia (85-96%) was excellent. Telithromycin was not active against the Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium group. Telithromycin inhibited 100% of Clostridium perfringens, 46-56% of Clostridium difficile and Clostridium ramosum and approximately 90% of non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - Bacterial toxins modifying the actin cytoskeleton.
AB  - Numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. The clostridial binary toxins (Iota and C2 families) ADP-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. The large clostridial toxins from Clostridium difficile, Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the Rho family that regulate actin polymerization. In contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from Escherichia coli activates Rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. The enterotoxin of Bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for E-cadherin and it promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. The bacterial toxins that modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.
TI  - [Isolation of toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile and enterotoxin producing Bacteroides fragilis from fecal specimens of patients suspected of antibiotic associated diarrhoea].
AB  - Fifty faecal samples from patients suspected of AAD (antibiotic associated diarrhoea) were studied for Clostridium difficile and enterotoxin producing Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF). Using TCD (Becton-Dickinson) and C. difficile Toxin A test (Oxoid) in 34% of specimens the presence of toxin A was detected. From all specimens 25 C. difficile strains were isolated. All isolated strains produced toxin B in vitro which was shown in Mc Coy cytotoxicity test. Eighteen strains only were toxin A positive in vitro. From all isolated C. difficile strains 28% were tox A (-) tox B (+). By means of PCR presence of toxin A and toxin B genes was tested directly in faecal samples and in strains. From the same 50 faecal samples 17 B. fragilis strains were isolated. Four of them produced the enterotoxin (fragilisin) which was detected on the HT 29/C1 cell line. Genes of fragilisin were found in strains and directly in faecal samples. Toxin producing C. difficile and B. fragilis (ETBF) together were found in 3 samples. From one faecal sample only ETBF was cultured.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin MIC90s, < or =1 mg/L, except 4 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). Gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s, 0.06-0.5 mg/L against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/L against Proteus/Morganella spp.). Relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against Providencia spp., and had good potency against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90s, 0.25-1 mg/L). Gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding MIC90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. The three quinolones were equipotent against Burkholderia cepacia (MIC90s, 8 mg/L), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 mg/L). Gatifloxacin was highly potent (MIC90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., Helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin MIC90s, 0.13 mg/L). The higher quinolone MICs for ureaplasma (MIC90s, 4-8 mg/L) may be due to the acidic pH of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. Like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). Of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. In summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.
TI  - Case-control study of enteropathogens associated with childhood diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
AB  - The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, is a major  center for research into diarrheal diseases. The center treats more than 100,000 patients a year. To obtain useful information representative of all patients, a surveillance system in which a 4% systematic sample of all patients is studied in detail, including etiological agents of diarrhea, was installed in October 1979. The first paper on etiology for the surveillance patients was published in 1982, which identified a potential enteric pathogen in 66% of patients. In subsequent years, several new agents of diarrhea have been identified. To assess the importance of a broader spectrum of diarrheal agents including the ones identified relatively recently, we studied 814 children with diarrhea. The children were up to 5 years of age and were part of the surveillance system. They were matched with an equal number of community controls without diarrhea. The study was conducted from February 1993 to June 1994. A potential enteric pathogen was isolated from 74.8% of diarrheal children and 43.9% of control children (P = 0.0001). Even though the first study was not a case-control study, it identified rotavirus, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp. , and Vibrio cholerae O1 as major pathogens. The present study identified these pathogens as being significantly associated with diarrhea. In addition, the study also identified six additional agents, including enteropathogenic E. coli, Aeromonas spp., V. cholerae O139, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Cryptosporidium parvum, as being significantly associated with diarrhea. Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella spp., diffusely adherent E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia lamblia were not significantly associated with diarrhea. Enteroinvasive E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and Cyclospora cayetanensis were not detected in any of the children. The major burden of diseases due to most pathogens occurred in the first year of life. As in the previous study, seasonal patterns were seen for diarrhea associated with rotavirus, V. cholerae, and enterotoxigenic E. coli, and infections with multiple pathogens were common. With a few exceptions, these findings are in agreement with those from other developing countries. This knowledge of a broader spectrum of etiological agents of diarrhea in the surveillance patients will help us plan studies into various aspects of diarrheal diseases in this population.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. T-3811, a free base of T-3811ME, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, T-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. T-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). T-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with GyrA and ParC (GrlA) mutations. The activity of T-3811 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. In common with other fluoroquinolones, T-3811 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella sp., with MIC90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. T-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. T-3811 was the most active agent against C. trachomatis (MIC, 0.008 microgram/ml) and M. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). The activity of T-3811 against M. tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. In experimental systemic infection with a GrlA mutant of S. aureus and experimental pneumonia with PRSP in mice, T-3811ME showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.
TI  - Toxins from anaerobic bacteria: specificity and molecular mechanisms of action.
AB  - Major advances have been made in the past five years in the identification of cellular targets of toxins produced by anaerobic bacteria. These targets include the vesicular membrane docking and fusion apparatus, the actin cytoskeleton, the signal transduction machinery and the cell membrane. The recent discovery that large clostridial toxins (Clostridium difficile A and B toxins, C. sordellii lethal and hemorrhagic toxins, and alpha C. novyi toxin) are monoglucosyltransferases, together with the establishment of the perfringolysin crystal structure, has led to new insights in the field of toxins from anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, was investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin A, roxithromycin, clarithromycin (14-membered ring macrolides), amoxycillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin against 719 recent clinical Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic isolates and type cultures. HMR 3647 generally demonstrated greater activity than the other compounds with MIC90s of < or =0.5 mg/L, except for Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC90 > 128 mg/L), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 1 mg/L) and the anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L) and Clostridium difficile (MIC90 = 1 mg/L). In general, an increase in the size of the inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu on selected strains had little effect on the MICs of HMR 3647. Additionally, the in-vitro activity of HMR 3647 was not affected by the presence of either 20 or 70% (v/v) human serum. The antichlamydial activity of HMR 3647 was generally greater than that of commonly used antichlamydial antimicrobials.
TI  - Human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes and their rapid detection.
AB  - Major human diseases caused by exotoxins produced by anaerobes include botulisms, tetanus, foodborne illness caused by enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens, and diarrhea/colitis caused by toxigenic Clostridium difficile. Recently, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) has been recognized, that may be related to childhood diarrheal disease. Detection test of botulinal neurotoxin is hardly performed at clinical laboratories since the most reliable means of detection and identification of botulinal toxin is by using mouse toxicity and neutralization tests. Clinical laboratories should request the tests to a reference laboratory. Since tetanus is easily diagnosed clinically on the basis of its unique, recognizable sings, the bacteriological tests is not usually requested. C. perfringens foodborne illness can be confirmed by testing stool specimens or the suspect food(s) for enterotoxin by the reversed passive latex agglutination test or counting > 10 5 C. perfringens per g of suspected food or > 10 6 C. perfringens spores per g of stool. Diagnosis of C. difficile-associated diarrhea/colitis is confirmed by detection of toxins A or B of C. difficile and/or recovery of toxigenic C. difficile. Isolation of C. difficile strains or detection C. difficile-speciffic antigen from stool specimens is less diagnostic since nontoxic or toxin A positive-toxin B negative strains are prevalent in Japan. Reliable laboratory tests for ETBF-associated childhood diarrhea are not established yet although ETBF can be proved by polymerase chain reaction for detection of the enterotoxin gene.
TI  - Comparative anti-anaerobic activity of Men 10700, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Men 10700, a new penem, has been compared with that of metronidazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav, imipenem and three third generation cephalosporins against 120 strains of anaerobes. The organisms tested comprised Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis and speciated members of the genera Fusobacterium, Veillonella and Peptostreptococcus. Men 10700 showed activity similar to that of imipenem, and was more potent than metronidazole against all species except C. difficile and P. anaerobius. The spectrum of activity of Men 10700 suggests this agent may be useful for treating infections caused by anaerobes.
TI  - Dioctahedral smectite neutralization activity of Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides fragilis toxins in vitro.
AB  - The neutralization activity of dioctahedral smectite for ten toxigenic Clostridium difficile and eight enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis strains was studied using McCoy and HT 29/C1 cell lines, respectively. Minimalization of the cytopathic effect of C. difficile toxin B on McCoy cell lines by dioctahedral smectite dissolved in PBS was observed. After incubation with dioctahedral smectite the toxic effects of B. fragilis enterotoxins on HT/29C1 (human colon adenocarcinoma cell line) were eliminated. Best neutralization of B. fragilis toxin was achieved using dioctahedral smectite dissolved in BHI.
TI  - In vitro activity of HMR 3647 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to determine the in vitro activity of HMR 3647 compared with other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria. The activity of HMR 3647 was determined against 342 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria by the agar dilution method and was compared with azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, erythromycin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. Among the macrolides HMR 3647 and among the beta-lactams imipenem were the most active agents tested. Anaerobic cocci (50 strains) had the following minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs): HMR 3647, range 0.016-0.125 mg/l; imipenem, range 0.016-0.064 mg/l. Propionibacterium acnes (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-1.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.032-0.064 mg/l. Clostridium perfringens (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.5 mg/l. Clostridium difficile (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.125-256 mg/l; imipenem, 4.0-8.0 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis (102 strains): HMR 3647, 0.032-16 mg/l; imipenem, 0.064-0.25 mg/l. Bacteroides and Prevotella species (50 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-4.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.016-0.25 mg/l. Fusobacterium nucleatum (30 strains): HMR 3647, 0.016-8.0 mg/l; imipenem, 0.008-0.064 mg/l. HMR 3647 may be useful as treatment and prophylaxis for infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039 and five other antimicrobial agents  against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039 against 360 anaerobic clinical isolates was  determined by the agar dilution method and compared to that of five other antimicrobial agents. BAY 12-8039 and imipenem were the most active agents tested. The following MIC90 values were determined for BAY 12-8039: Peptostreptococcus spp. (50 isolates), 1 mg/l; Propionibacterium acnes (30 isolates). 0.25 mg/l; Clostridium perfringens (30 isolates), 0.5 mg/l; Clostridium difficile (50 isolates), 2 mg/l; Bacteroides fragilis (50 isolates), 1 mg/l; non-fragilis Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella spp. (100 isolates), 2 mg/l; and Fusobacterium spp. (50 isolates), 0.25 mg/l. The results of the present study show that BAY 12-8039 may be useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Detection of Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin gene by PCR.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis constitutes about 1% of the bacterial flora in intestines of normal humans. Enterotoxigenic strains of B. fragilis have been associated with diarrheal diseases in humans and animals. The enterotoxin produced by these isolates induces fluid changes in ligated intestinal loops and an in vitro cytotoxic response in HT-29 cells. We developed a nested PCR to detect the enterotoxin gene of B. fragilis in stool specimens. After DNA extraction, a 367-bp fragment was amplified with two outer primers. The amplicon from this reaction was subjected to a second round of amplification with a set of internal primers. With these inner primers, a 290-bp DNA fragment was obtained which was confirmed as part of the B. fragilis enterotoxin gene by Southern blotting with a nonradioactive internal probe and a chemiluminescence system. By this approach, B. fragilis enterotoxin gene sequences were detected in eight known enterotoxigenic human isolates and nine enterotoxigenic horse isolates. No amplification products were obtained from DNA extracted from 28 nonenterotoxigenic B. fragilis isolates or B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, B. ovatus, Escherichia coli, or Clostridium difficile. The sensitivity of this assay allowed us to detect as little as 1 pg of enterotoxin DNA sequences or 100 to 1,000 cells of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis/g of stool. Enterotoxin production of all isolates was confirmed in vitro in HT-29 cells. A 100% correlation was obtained between enterotoxin detection by cytotoxin assay and the nested PCR assay. This rapid and sensitive assay can be used to identify enterotoxigenic B. fragilis and may be used clinically to determine the role of B. fragilis in diarrheal diseases.
TI  - In vitro activities of cefminox against anaerobic bacteria compared with those of nine other compounds.
AB  - The agar dilution MIC method was used to test the activity of cefminox, a beta-lactamase-stable cephamycin, compared with those of cefoxitin, cefotetan, moxalactam, ceftizoxime, cefotiam, cefamandole, cefoperazone, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 357 anaerobes. Overall, cefminox was the most active beta-lactam, with an MIC at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (MIC50) of 1.0 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 16.0 microg/ml. Other beta-lactams were less active, with respective MIC50s and MIC90s of 2.0 and 64.0 microg/ml for cefoxitin, 2.0 and 128.0 microg/ml for cefotetan, 2.0 and 64.0 microg/ml for moxalactam, 4.0 and > 128.0 microg/ml for ceftizoxime, 16.0 and > 128.0 microg/ml for cefotiam, 8.0 and >128.0 microg/ml for cefamandole, and 4.0 and 128.0 microg/ml for cefoperazone. The clindamycin MIC50 and MIC90 were 0.5 and 8.0 microg/ml, respectively, and the metronidazole MIC50 and MIC90 were 1.0 and 4.0 microg/ml, respectively. Cefminox was especially active against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 2.0 microg/ml), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (MIC90, 4.0 microg/ml), fusobacteria (MIC90, 1.0 microg/ml), peptostreptococci (MIC90, 2.0 microg/ml), and clostridia, including Clostridium difficile (MIC90, 2.0 microg/ml). Time-kill studies performed with six representative anaerobic species revealed that at the MIC all compounds except ceftizoxime were bactericidal (99.9% killing) against all strains after 48 h. At 24 h, only cefminox and cefoxitin at 4x the MIC and cefoperazone at 8x the MIC were bactericidal against all strains. After 12 h, at the MIC all compounds except moxalactam, ceftizoxime, cefotiam, cefamandole, clindamycin, and metronidazole gave 90% killing of all strains. After 3 h, cefminox at 2 x the MIC produced the most rapid effect, with 90% killing of all strains.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of AM-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of AM-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Although AM-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (MIC90s > or =3.13 mg/mL), 76% of the B. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at AM-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/L. AM-1155 was highly active against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90s < or =0.39 mg/L). An in-vivo study using a mixed infection with AM-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible B. fragilis and Escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. AM-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against E. coli. These results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of AM-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. Clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in AM-1155-treated mice. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of AM-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the B. fragilis group and P. bivia should be evaluated further.
TI  - Comparative antianaerobic activities of the ketolides HMR 3647 (RU 66647) and HMR 3004 (RU 64004).
AB  - HMR 3647 (RU 66647) and HMR 3004 (RU 64004), two ketolides, had MICs at which 50% of the strains are inhibited (MIC50s) of 0.06 to 0.125 microg/ml and MIC90s of 16.0 microg/ml against 352 anaerobes. MIC50s and MIC90s of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin were 0.5 to 2.0 microg/ml and 32.0 to >64.0 microg/ml, respectively. HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 were more active against non-Bacteroides fragilis-group anaerobes (other than Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium varium, and Clostridium difficile).
TI  - Antianaerobic activity of the ketolide RU 64004 compared to activities of four macrolides, five beta-lactams, clindamycin, and metronidazole.
AB  - Agar dilution methodology (with added Oxyrase in the case of the macrolide group  to allow incubation without added CO2) was used to compare the activity of RU 64004, a new ketolide, with the activities of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, clindamycin, amoxicillin with and without clavulanate, piperacillin with and without tazobactam, metronidazole, and imipenem against 379 anaerobes. Overall, RU 64004 yielded an MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC50) of 1.0 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 16.0 microg/ml. In comparison, MIC50s and MIC90s of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin were 2.0 to 8.0 and >64.0 microg/ml, respectively. MICs of macrolides, including RU 64004, were higher for Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Clostridium difficile than for the other species. RU 64004 was more active against gram-positive rods and cocci, Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and fusobacteria other than F. mortiferum and F. varium than against the Bacteroides fragilis group. Overall MIC50s and MIC90s (in micrograms per milliliter), respectively, of other compounds were as follows: clindamycin, 1.0 and 16.0; amoxicillin, 4.0 and 64.0; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 0.5 and 4.0; piperacillin, 8.0 and >64.0; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.0 and 16.0; metronidazole, 1.0 and 4.0; and imipenem, 0.25 and 1.0.
TI  - Bacteroides fragilis toxin rearranges the actin cytoskeleton of HT29/C1 cells without direct proteolysis of actin or decrease in F-actin content.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic strains of B. fragilis associated with childhood diarrhea produce a 20 kD zinc metalloprotease toxin (BFT). BFT is reported to cleave G-actin in vitro and also causes dramatic rounding and rearrangement of the F-actin cytoskeleton in human intestinal epithelial cell lines (HT29) and HT29/C1). To test the hypothesis that the proteolysis of cellular actin by BFT in vivo may contribute to these alterations in morphology and cytoskeletal architecture, we assessed the F-actin content and the arrangement of the F- and G-actin cytoskeleton in BFT-treated HT29/C1 cells by spectrofluorimetry, confocal microscopy, and immunoblotting. BFT-treated cells were compared to cells treated with C. difficile toxin A (CDA) or cytochalasin D. Using spectrofluorimetric quantification, the F-actin content of BFT- and cytochalasin D-treated cells was unchanged in contrast to a significant decrease in CDA-treated cells. By confocal microscopy, the arrangement of F- and G-actin in all treated cells was markedly different than control cells. There was no change in the immunoblotting pattern of actin in the Triton-soluble or -insoluble cellular fractions of BFT-treated HT29/C1 cells. We conclude that BFT alters the F- and G-actin cytoskeletal architecture of HT29/C1 cells without direct proteolysis of actin or decrease in F-actin content.
TI  - Effect of lactulose on short-chain fatty acids and lactate production and on the  growth of faecal flora, with special reference to Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Lactulose exerts a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy by decreasing toxic short-chain (iC4-nC6) fatty acid (isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate, valerate, isocaproate and caproate) production. However, the precise mechanism by which lactulose exerts this effect remains uncertain. This study investigated the effect of lactulose on faecal flora, particularly Clostridium difficile, which produces mostly iC4-nC6 fatty acids. An in-vitro faecal incubation system was used to estimate how lactulose influences production of short-chain (C2-nC6) fatty acids and lactate. Faecal specimens were collected from patients with liver cirrhosis, who carried C. difficile in the colon. Supplementation of lactulose along with blood in faecal specimens decreased iC4-nC6 fatty acids production and increased acetate and lactate production, resulting in increased faecal acidity. These changes were statistically significant when compared with supplementation by blood alone. Quantitative faecal culture demonstrated that lactulose supplementation suppressed the growth of C. difficile and Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group), iC4-nC6 fatty acids-producing organisms. These results suggest that decreased faecal levels of iC4-nC6 fatty acids after lactulose supplementation may be related to suppression of iC4-nC6 fatty acids-producing faecal organisms, especially C. difficile.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone, was studied in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin (CP 99,219), cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria. Its activity against mycobacteria and chlamydia was also investigated. BAY 12-8039 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of strains tested were inhibited [MIC90S] < or = 1 microgram/ml, except for Serratia spp. MIC90 2 microgram/ml), Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, 0.015 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 micrgram/ml), and these results were comparable to those obtained for ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the quinolones were more active than the beta-lactam agents but BAY 12-8039 was less active than ciprofloxacin. Strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were fourfold more susceptible to BAY 12-8039 and trovafloxacin (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml) than to ciprofloxacin. BAY 12-8039 was as active as trovafloxacin but more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus auerus (MIC90S, 0.12 micrograms/ml). The activity of BAY 12-8039 against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) was lower than that against methicillin-susceptible strains. BAY 12-8039 was active against anaerobes (MIC90S < or = 2 micrograms/ml), being three- to fourfold more active against Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella spp., and Clostridium difficile than was ciprofloxacin. Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, BAY 12-8039 exhibited activity comparable to that of rifampin (MICs < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml). Against Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae BAY 12-8039 was more active (MICs < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) than either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin and exhibited a greater lethal effect than either to these two agents. The protein binding of BAY 12-8039 was determined at 1 and 5 micrograms/ml as 30 and 26.4%, respectively. The presence of human serum (at 20 or 70%) had no marked effect on the in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinolones and other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic  bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and DU-6859a against peptostreptococci, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Fusobacterium were determined by an agar dilution method. These activities were compared with those of piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, and metronidazole. Imipenem, metronidazole, and DU-6859a were the most active antimicrobial agents that were tested. The in vitro activity of DU-6859a was superior to those of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, and sparfloxacin.
TI  - Bacteroides fragilis toxin rapidly intoxicates human intestinal epithelial cells  (HT29/C1) in vitro.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis strains associated with childhood diarrhea produce a 20-kDa protein toxin (BFT). Purified BFT causes striking morphologic changes in subconfluent human colonic epithelial cells (HT29/C1). In a 3-h HT29/C1 cell assay, the estimated half-maximal effective concentration of BFT was 12.5 pM, and morphologic effects were detectable as early as 30 min and nearly complete by 1.5 h. Concentrations as low as 0.5 pM could also cause intoxication, but morphologic changes were detectable only when the assay was extended to 18 h. The onset of this intoxication was concentration dependent and rapid, occurring within minutes (<7 min at 0.25 nM, <2 min at 2.5 nM). Notably, the onset of intoxication at 37 degrees C became irreversible to washing within 2 min after exposure to BFT. Morphologic changes were completely inhibited by treatment of HT29/C1 cells with BFT at 4 degrees C but could be demonstrated by subsequent warming to temperatures of 15 degrees C or higher after washing. The time required for the association of BFT with HT29/C1 cells at 4 degrees C was inversely correlated with concentration. Inhibitors of endosomal and Golgi trafficking (NH4Cl and brefeldin A) prevented the intoxication of HT29/C1 cells by Clostridium difficile toxin A and cholera toxin, respectively, but not by BFT. Agents altering microtubule structure did not affect the cellular activity of BFT. These data indicate that a purified toxin from B. fragilis strains associated with diarrhea rapidly and irreversibly intoxicates human intestinal epithelial cells (HT29/C1) in a concentration- and temperature-dependent manner and that the process of intoxication may not involve internalization mechanisms utilizing microtubules or sensitive to pH or brefeldin A.
TI  - Human intestinal epithelial cells swell and demonstrate actin rearrangement in response to the metalloprotease toxin of Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) cells produce a 20-kDa heat-labile metalloprotease toxin which is potentially important in the pathogenesis of diarrhea associated with this infection. Previous studies indicate that subconfluent HT29/C1 cells treated with the B. fragilis toxin (BFT) develop morphologic changes with dissolution of tight clusters and apparent swelling. Such alterations suggest toxin-stimulated reorganization of the cellular cytoskeleton. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of BFT on actin microfilaments (F-actin) and cell volume. As assessed by fluorescent phallicidin staining which detects F-actin, BFT treatment of HT29/C1 cells resulted in redistribution of F-actin with loss of stress fibers, a floccular staining pattern, and cellular membrane blebbing without quantitative changes in F-actin fluorescence intensity. The F-actin redistribution was time and concentration dependent. In contrast to the cell shrinkage observed in response to the F-actin-depolymerizing agents cytochalasin D and Clostridium difficile toxin A, BFT stimulated an increase in HT29/C1 cell volume of 10 to 25% (compared with control cells) over a 24-h time course. Only 10 to 30 ng of BFT per ml was necessary to stimulate a maximal increase in HT29/C1 cell volume. The effect of BFT on cell volume was persistent and dependent on the proteolytic activity of BFT. In agreement with cell viability assays indicating that BFT did not injure HT29/C1 cells, intoxicated cells exhibited regulatory volume decrease, suggesting that toxin-treated cells remain physiologically dynamic. We conclude that BFT acts on the intestinal epithelial cell cytoskeleton to alter F-actin structure and to stimulate an increase in HT29/C1 cell volume. Although these two activities of BFT appear to be linked, the precise sequence of cellular events following intoxication of HT29/C1 cells with BFT remains unclear. We hypothesize that these F-actin and cell volume changes may lead to an alteration in tight junction function in the polarized intestinal epithelium, contributing to the pathogenesis of diarrhea in ETBF infections.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of activities of nitazoxanide and tizoxanide against anaerobes and aerobic organisms.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of nitazoxanide and its main metabolite, tizoxanide, were tested against a broad range of bacteria, including anaerobes. Metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and clindamycin were used as positive controls. MICs were determined by reference agar dilution methods. The 241 anaerobes were all inhibited by nitazoxanide, with the MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC90S) being between 0.06 and 4 mg/liter with the exception of those for Propionibacterium species, for which the MIC90 was 16 mg/liter. The MIC90s of nitazoxanide were 0.5 mg/liter for the Bacteroides fragilis group (80 strains), 0.06 mg/liter for Clostridium difficile (21 strains), and 0.5 mg/liter for Clostridium perfringens (16 strains). Metronidazole showed a level of activity comparable to that of nitazoxanide except against Bifidobacterium species, against which it was poorly active, and Propionibacterium species, which were resistant to metronidazole. The other antibiotics showed various levels of activity against anaerobes, with imipenem along with nitazoxanide being the most active agents tested. Tizoxanide was less effective than nitazoxanide except against the B. fragilis group, against which its activity was similar to that of nitazoxanide. Under aerobic conditions, nitazoxanide demonstrated poor activity against members of the family Enterobacteriacae and Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus species. The same results were obtained when culture was performed under anaerobic conditions with the notable exception of the results against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of nitazoxanide were in the range of 2 to 4 mg/liter for 34 clinical isolates of S. aureus, 12 of which were methicillin resistant, while tizoxanide was not effective.
TI  - [In vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, marbofloxacin (RO 09-1168) against strictly anaerobic bacteria and some bacteria from human fecal flora].
AB  - As recommended by the EEC, the in vitro activity of a veterinary quinolone has to be evaluated on human strains isolated from the gut and especially against anaerobes. Thus, the MICs for Marbofloxacin were determined by the reference agar method (Norma NCCLS M11 A3) using Wilkins Chalgren medium for the 124 anaerobic strains and Mueller Hinton agar for E. coli, Proteus, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus. On the whole aerobes, the activity of Marbofloxacin was equal or slightly greater to that of ofloxacin. The modal MIC was 0.03 mg/l for Enterobacteriaceae, 2 mg/l and 16 mg/l for Enterococcus and Lactobacillus strains, respectively. Considering the anti-anaerobic activity of this new drug, in comparison with that of ofloxacin, MICs for ofloxacin were generally one log2 higher for Gram negative bacilli and two log2 higher for Gram positive bacilli. Modal MICs for marbofloxacin were 0.12 mg/l for Clostridium perfringens, 0.5 mg/l for Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus strains, 1 mg/l for Bifidobacteria, 2 mg/l for non-fragilis members of the B. fragilis group, and 4 mg/l for C. difficile strains, respectively. It appears in vitro that Marbofloxacin was a more potent agent than ofloxacin on the whole anaerobes.
TI  - [In vitro activities of sulopenem, a new parenteral penem, against anaerobes].
AB  - In vitro activities of sulopenem, a novel parenteral penem, was compared with those of imipenem, flomoxef, cefuzonam, cefoperazone and sulbactam/ampicillin against 66 reference strains (19 genera, 61 species) and 392 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and fastidious aerobic bacteria. Sulopenem had a very broad spectrum against anaerobic bacteria. In general, this compound was active against anaerobic reference strains with MICs of < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml, while being the least active against Bifidobacterium spp. and less active than imipenem against Lactobacillus spp. Sulopenem was more active against Bacteroides fragilis isolates than imipenem and had the highest activities against Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. among the antibiotics tested. Sulopenem was not hydrolyzed by oxyiminocephalosporinase type 1 produced by B. fragilis GAI-0558, GAI-7955 and GAI-10150 and its stability was comparable to imipenem. Its susceptibilities to hydrolysis by a metallo-beta-lactamase from B. fragilis GAI-30144 was less than imipenem. Sulopenem (120 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 days) was as effective as imipenem/cilastatin against a mixed intraabdominal mice infection due to E. coli and B. fragilis. Sulopenem (20 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days) did not induce an overgrowth of Clostridium difficile in the caecum of mice.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY y 3118, and nine other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of BAY y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone, was determined against 257 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activities of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and ornidazole. Overall, BAY y 3118 was the most active agent tested against the Bacteroides fragilis group. Its activity (MIC90, 0.5 mg/L) was 16-fold lower than that of sparfloxacin (MIC90, 8 mg/L), and more than 100-fold lower than that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 64 mg/L) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 128 mg/L) against the group. No strains belonging to this group were resistant to metronidazole (MICs range, 0.12-2 mg/L) and ornidazole (MICs range, 0.12-4 mg/L). BAY y 3118 was more active than those quinolones against Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and C. difficile (MIC90, 0.12, 0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively). The activity of BAY y 3118 against Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 1 mg/L) was slightly lower than that of the other Gram-positive bacteria tested. In general, BAY y 3118 was more active than cefoxitin, and it was superior to antianaerobic chemical agents like metronidazole, ornidazole and clindamycin. Pharmacokinetic and clinical trials are required to define the role of BAY y 3118 in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Clostridial infection in children.
AB  - A survey of the isolation of Clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. The isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified Clostridium spp., 37 (33%) C. perfringens, 13 (12%) C. ramosum, five (4%) C. innocuum, six (5%) C. botulinum, three (3%) C. difficile, two (2%) C. butyricum, and one isolate each of C. bifermentans, C. clostridiiforme, C. limosum and C. paraputrificum. Most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). Predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. These were immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). The clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. The species most commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (50), Escherichia coli (22), pigmented Prevotella or Porphyromonas spp. (18) and Fusobacterium spp. (10). Most Bacteroides and Escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck sites. Antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). Only two patients died. These data illustrate the importance of Clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.
TI  - [Effect of biapenem (L-627) on fecal flora in gnotobiotic mice and children].
AB  - Biapenem (L-627), a novel injectable carbapenem antibiotic, was studied with regard to its effect on mice inoculated with four types of bacteria and on the intestinal flora of pediatric patients. L-627 was given i.m., 40 mg/kg once daily for 5 consecutive days, to mice inoculated enterically with four types of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bifidobacterium breve). Except for a mild decrease in E. coli, there were no major fluctuations in viable bacterial counts in the feces during the treatment. Five children with bacterial infections (3 boys and 2 girls; ages: 1 month to 7 years and 7 months; body weights 4.62-21.8 kg) were given L-627 at 6.0 to 11.7 mg/kg 3 times daily for 7 to 11 days. Among aerobes, although Enterobacteriaceae such as E. coli tended to decrease remarkably in all patients, there was no major change in Enterococcus. Consequently, total aerobe counts did not change significantly in any patient. Among anaerobes, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Eubacterium, which are the predominant organisms in infants, decreased remarkably in some patients. One of the patients showed a marked decrease in total anaerobe count associated with a change in fecal characteristics (diarrhea). Glucose nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli or fungi did not become predominant organisms in any patient. Recovery from these changes in the intestinal flora was noted promptly after terminating L-627 treatment. L-627 was detected in the feces of 4 patients during treatment. The fecal concentration ranged from 0.24 to 2.22 micrograms/g. Clostridium difficile was not detected in any patient. Although C. difficile D-1 antigen was observed in 2 patients, it bore no relationship to fecal properties. The results indicated that L-627 had relatively few effects on the intestinal flora compared to other new beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Activity of WY-49605 compared with those of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, cefaclor, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 384 anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards agar dilution method was used to compare the in vitro activity of WY-49605 (also called SUN/SY 5555 and ALP-201), a new broad-spectrum oral penem, to those of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, cefaclor, cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 384 clinically isolated anaerobes. These anaerobic organisms included 90 strains from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 87 Prevotella and Porphyromonas strains, non-B. fragilis group Bacteroides strains, 56 fusobacteria, 55 peptostreptococci, 49 gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, and 47 clostridia. Overall, WY-49605 had an MIC range of 0.015 to 8.0 micrograms/ml, an MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC50) of 0.25 microgram/ml, and an MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90) of 2.0 micrograms/ml. Good activity against all anaerobe groups was observed, except for Clostridium difficile and lactobacilli (MIC50s of 4.0 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of 8.0 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). Imipenem had an MIC50 of 0.03 microgram/ml and an MIC90 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Ciprofloxacin was much less active (MIC50 of 2.0 micrograms/ml and MIC90 of 16.0 micrograms/ml). By comparison, all oral beta-lactams were less active than WY-49605, with susceptibilities as follows: amoxicillin MIC50 of 8.0 micrograms/ml and MIC90 of > 256.0 micrograms/ml), amoxicillin-clavulanate MIC50 of 1.0 microgram/ml and MIC90 of 8.0 micrograms/ml, cefaclor MIC50 of 8.0 micrograms/ml and MIC90 of > 32.0 micrograms/ml, cefpodoxime MIC50 of 4.0 micrograms/ml and MIC90 of > 32.0 micrograms/ml, and cefuroxime MIC50 of 4.0 micrograms/ml and MIC90 of > 32.0 micrograms/ml. Clindamycin was active against all groups except some members of the B. fragilis group, Fusobacterium varium, and some clostridia ( overall MIC50 of 0.5 micrograms/ml and overall MIC90 of 8.0 micrograms/ml). Metronidazole was active (MIC of less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml) against all gram-negative anaerobic rods, but most gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, some peptostreptococci, and some clostridia were less susceptible. To date, WY-49605 is the most active oral beta-lactam against anaerobes: these results suggest clinical evaluation for clinical indications suitable for oral therapy.
TI  - In-vitro activity of clinafloxacin (CI-960) and PD 131628-2 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of two new quinolones, CI-960 and PD 131628-2 were determined against 339 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared to cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole. The NCCLS-approved Wadsworth agar dilution technique with Brucella-lysed blood agar was used throughout the study. Breakpoints of the new quinolones are 2 mg/L, and breakpoints for cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole are 32, 8 and 16 mg/L, respectively. CI-960 displayed excellent activity, inhibiting all strains tested at 1 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited 94% of Bacteroides fragilis, 75% of other B. fragilis group isolates, 87% of Prevotella spp, 79% of the Fusobacterium mortiferum-varium group, 74% of non-sporing gram-positive bacilli, and 89-100% of Clostridium spp other than Clostridium difficile at 2 mg/L. None of the eight strains of C. difficile was inhibited at 2 mg/L although they were inhibited at 4 mg/L. PD 131628-2 inhibited all strains of other Bacteroides spp, Porphyromonas spp, and Fusobacterium nucleatum at < or = 1 mg/L.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of a new quinolone agent, DU-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of DU-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin, metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. DU-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every group of organisms. MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis (57), other B. fragilis group species (84), Bilophila wadsworthia (15), Clostridium species (27) (including C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum), Fusobacterium nucleatum (16), Fusobacterium mortiferum-F. varium group species (10), Peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and Prevotella species (25).
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ICI 194660, CAS 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. They included Bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), Prevotella bivia (n = 11), Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), Clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated species and genera, e.g. Selenomonas sputigena and Clostridium symbiosum. Bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, Clostridium species, including C. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. Meropenem was especially active against Bacteroides gracilis (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Prevotella disiens (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml), Fusobacterium nucleatum (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml) and Veillonella parvula (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml). The results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.
TI  - [Susceptibility of strict anaerobic bacteria to antibiotics in France: a multicenter study].
AB  - During 1992, the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of 462 anaerobic bacteria was performed in 7 hospitals, by the reference agar dilution method. Among the 222 Bacteroides fragilis group strains, only one Bacteroides fragilis strain was resistant to imipenem and all betalactams, even combined with betalactamase-inhibitors while metronidazole resistance could not be detected. One major outer membrane protein (probably a porin) was lacking in some of the six amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistant Bacteroides fragilis group strains. Evolution in antibiotic resistance rates could be assessed only for clindamycin and piperacillin whose resistance rates increased to 14 and 15.8 p. cent, respectively. On the whole anaerobic strains resistance rates were: imipenem 0.2, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid 0.5, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or metronidazole 1.5, piperacillin 9.1, cefotaxime-sulbactam 9.7, cefoxitin 12.8, clindamycin 13.7, cefotaxime 27.2, amoxicillin 45 and ciprofloxacin 70, respectively.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated system for identification of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A fully automated computer-assisted system (ATB system, bioMerieux, France) which uses disposable microenzymatic panels was evaluated for its ability to identify 215 strains of anaerobic bacteria (clinical isolates and reference strains). All strains were examined using conventional identification protocols and by gas chromatographic analysis of short-chain fatty acids. Automated reading of Rapid ID32A test kits (bioMerieux, France) by the ATB system gave correct identification for 195 strains (90.7%): 92.25% of gram-negative anaerobes (116 strains) and 89% of gram-positive anaerobes (99 strains) were correctly identified. Twelve strains (5.6%) were incorrectly identified and 8 strains (3.7%) were not identified by the system. For some strains in the Bacteroides fragilis group, for Clostridium difficile and for the Fusobacterium genus, additional tests suggested by the ATB software were necessary to reach a final identification at the species or genus level. On the basis of the high incidence of correct identifications and the comparison of these results with those obtained previously using other commercially available kits, the ATB system was found to be a reliable method for identification of anaerobic bacteria in clinical laboratories.
TI  - In vitro activity of DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot, two new glycylcyclines, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot against 350 anaerobic bacterial  strains including anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. Their activity was compared with that of minocycline, doxycycline, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot and imipenem were the most active agents tested. DMG-Mino and DMG-DM Dot had in vitro activity superior to that of minocycline and doxycycline.
TI  - Quantitative cultures of the mucosal-associated bacteria in the mechanically prepared colon and rectum.
AB  - Little is known about the mucosal microflora of the colon and rectum at the time  of elective surgery. Our objective was to determine the concentrations of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria associated with the mucosa of the mechanically prepared large bowel. Ten patients were studied after a standard polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage preparation. No patient had taken antibiotics in the preceding four weeks. Sterile wire brushes passed through the colonoscope during advancement were used to culture the rectal, transverse colon, and cecal mucosa. Total anaerobic, aerobic, Gram-positive, and enteric bacterial counts were determined along with specific cultures for Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus, and staphylococcus species. The results showed that there was a significant increase (P < 0.01) in aerobes, anaerobes, enterics, Gram positives, B. fragilis, and E. coli mucosal counts with proximal progression. Aerobes showed a steady gradient, while anaerobes demonstrated an increase from the rectum to the transverse colon but no change between the transverse colon and cecum. We conclude that, in the prepared bowel, there is an increase in the mucosal bacterial counts in the more proximal portions of the bowel. The results may serve as a baseline for future studies on the mucosal-associated bacteria of the large intestine.
TI  - In vitro activity of the new quinolone BAY y 3118 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY y 3118 against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by an agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. BAY y 3118, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole were the most active agents tested. The in vitro activity of BAY y 3118 against anaerobic bacteria was superior to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
TI  - Susceptibilities of 428 gram-positive and -negative anaerobic bacteria to Bay y3118 compared with their susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefoxitin.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 428 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes (including  selected cefoxitin-resistant strains) to Bay y3118 (a new fluoroquinolone), ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and piperacillin-tazobactam were tested. Organisms comprised 115 Bacteroides fragilis group, 116 non-B. fragilis Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., 40 fusobacteria, 58 peptostreptococci, 48 gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, and 51 clostridia. beta-Lactamase production was demonstrated in 87% of the gram-negative rods but in none of the gram-positive organisms. Overall, Bay y3118 was the most active agent, with all organisms inhibited at an MIC of < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml (MICs for 50% [MIC50] and 90% [MIC90] of strains tested, 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively). By contrast, ciprofloxacin was much less active, with only 42% of strains susceptible at a breakpoint of 2.0 micrograms/ml (MIC50, 4.0 micrograms/ml; MIC90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). Metronidazole was active against all gram-negative rods, but 7% of peptostreptococci, 83% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, and 4% of non-Clostridium perfringens, non-Clostridium difficile clostridia were resistant to this agent (MICs, > 16.0 micrograms/ml). Clindamycin was active against 94% of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp., 91% of peptostreptococci, and 100% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods, but was active against only 70% of fusobacteria and 53% of clostridia. Cefoxitin was active against > or = 90% of all groups except the B. fragilis group and non-Propionibacterium acnes gram-positive non-spore-forming rods (both 85%) and C. difficile (20%). Significant enhancement of piperacillin by tazobactam was seen in all beta-lactamase-positive strains (99% susceptible; MIC90, 8.0 micrograms/ml), and all beta-lactamase-negative strains were susceptible to piperacillin (MIC90, 8.0 micrograms/ml). Clinical studies are required to delineate the role of Bay y3118 in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of meropenem and selected comparative agents against anaerobic bacteria at seven North American centers.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem and comparative agents against approximately 1,000 anaerobes was determined using the disk dilution methods recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). The organisms represented 27 species of six genera and included the most common pathogens. Meropenem and imipenem were the most active drugs and were comparable in overall activity, generally exhibiting an MIC90 of < or = 1 micrograms/mL. In contrast, the MICs of cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole were 32, 16, and 2 micrograms/mL, respectively. Meropenem was two- to fourfold more active than imipenem against selected Bacteroides species, Clostridium species, and Fusobacterium species. At a concentration of 1 microgram/mL, meropenem was more active than imipenem against cefoxitin-resistant Bacteroides fragilis or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. At a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/mL, meropenem was more active than imipenem against clindamycin-resistant Bacteroides distasonis. At a concentration of 2 micrograms/mL, meropenem was more active than imipenem against cefoxitin-resistant or clindamycin-resistant Clostridium difficile. Thus, meropenem's high potency and broad-spectrum activity against common, rare, and drug-resistant anaerobes confirms its utility in the treatment of mixed anaerobic and aerobic infections.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of T-3761, a new quinolone derivative.
AB  - T-3761, a new quinolone derivative, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.20 to 100 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria, including members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus; 0.025 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against gram-negative bacteria, including members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genus Haemophilus; 0.05 to 50 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, including members of the genera Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, and Moraxella; 0.025 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; and 6.25 to 25 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Peptostreptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of T-3761 against these clinical isolates was comparable to or 2- to 32-fold greater than those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin and 2- to 16-fold less and 1- to 8-fold greater than those of ciprofloxacin and tosulfoxacin, respectively. When administered orally, T-3761 showed good efficacy in mice against systemic, pulmonary, and urinary tract infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vivo activity of T-3761 was comparable to or greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and tosufloxacin against most infection models in mice. The activities of T-3761 were lower than those of tosufloxacin against gram-positive bacterial systemic and pulmonary infections in mice but not against infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The activities of T-3761 against systemic quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in mice were 2- to 14-fold greater than those of the reference agents.
TI  - Virulence factors in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Various surface structures can be expressed in Bacteroides fragilis, but little is known about capsular structures in other non-spore-forming anaerobes. Fimbriae have been isolated from Bacteroides fragilis and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The importance of iron-repressible outer membrane proteins as virulence factors in Bacteroides fragilis is under study. The low endotoxic activity of Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide can be attributed to the chemical composition of this organism's lipid A. A tissue culture system for the demonstration of Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin has recently been described. The toxins A and B of Clostridium difficile are immunologically distinct. The importance of IgA proteases and other enzymes as virulence factors in anaerobic bacteria remains unclear.
TI  - Epidemiological aspects of infections caused by Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile are two of the most common anaerobes associated with human disease. Studies on the epidemiology of Bacteroides fragilis are limited and are based predominantly on serogrouping, which suggests intraspecies differences. Further studies using newer techniques for typing are required to elucidate the epidemiological characteristics of this important pathogen. By contrast, numerous phenotypic, immunological and molecular methods have been developed for typing and fingerprinting of Clostridium difficile and applied in epidemiological studies to show conclusively that Clostridium difficile is nosocomially acquired and that there is transmission and cross-infection between hospital patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of L-627 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of L-627 against 370 anaerobic bacterial strains including  anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. L-627, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active agents tested. L-627 had in vitro activity similar to that of the other carbapenems tested.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to tosufloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tosufloxacin against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium  acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. Tosufloxacin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active agents tested. Tosufloxacin has an antibacterial activity that warrants investigation in clinical trials.
TI  - [The influence of cefdinir on the intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  - The influence of cefdinir (CFDN), a new oral cephalosporin, on the intestinal bacterial flora was studied in tetra-contaminated mice and in pediatric patients. CFDN in fine granules was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once a day for 5 consecutive days to mice contaminated with 4 different species of organism: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium breve. No remarkable changes were observed in the fecal viable cell counts except that decreases in E. coli counts were observed on the day 3 to 5 after starting administration. The subjects in pediatric study were 7 children with infections, 3 boys and 4 girls, with their ages from 6 months to 12 years 7 months. Their body weights ranged from 5.5 to 29.2 kg. CFDN fine granules was administered at each dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 to 14 days. During the administration of CFDN, some variations were observed in the pattern of changes in the fecal bacterial flora between subjects. Although Enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes were markedly decreased in 2 cases, total counts of aerobes were unchanged in the 2 cases, whereas main aerobes and anaerobes except enterococci hardly varied in the other cases. There was no case in which glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative rods and fungi became predominant species continually. Although Clostridium difficile and C. difficile D-1 antigens were detected in 1 and 4 cases, respectively, no relationship was found between the number of C. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. With regard to the drug sensitivities of bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration of CFDN, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as Enterococcus and Bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. CFDN was detected in fecal samples from 2 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 0.99-254 micrograms/g. High value of CFDN was found in a case with low beta-lactamase activity in feces, in which marked decrease of Enterobacteriaceae and total counts of anaerobes was observed. The above results suggest that CFDN is considered to be a drug with relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora. But as high concentrations of drugs were detected in feces under some circumstances, our attention will be required. Particular care is also required for the occurrence of diarrhea and microbial replacement during continuous, long-term administration of the drug.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to PD 131628.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 131628 against anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria was determined by the agar dilution method. This activity was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. PD 131628, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol were the most active agents tested.
TI  - Newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  - The improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. Several new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. WIN 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus spp. BMY 40062, PD 117558, PD 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these species. These drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and the Bacteroides fragilis group. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium chelonae, and Mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. In addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against Mycobacterium leprae. Sparfloxacin, BMY 40062 and WIN 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular Legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. Improved antibacterial activity has also been found against Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas maltophilia. By contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including Plasmodium spp., Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani, but not against Toxoplasma gondii. In the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  - In in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of Acinetobacter spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila. They were also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. Other Pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. Both agents were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing Branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher MICs. Gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and Campylobacter coli/jejuni usually susceptible. Both antibiotics had good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and Staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. All streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. Both antibiotics had little useful activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group or Bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. Clostridium difficile and some other Clostridium species were resistant.
TI  - [Influence of cefodizime via intravenous bolus injection on human fecal flora].
AB  - Cefodizime (CDZM), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotic, was given to 8 healthy male volunteers with ages 23-28 years (mean: 24 years) and body weights 54-73 kg (mean: 64 kg). 4 volunteers received 2 g b.i.d., intravenous infusion for 5 days, and 4 volunteers had 4 g b.i.d. for the same duration. We studied changes in bacterial flora and drug levels in feces, as well as changes in susceptibility of isolated microbes to CDZM, cefmetazole, cefotaxime (CTX) and cefoperazone. Adverse drug reactions and changes in laboratory findings were also investigated. The following results were obtained. 1. In fecal flora for the 2 g b.i.d. group, on day 3 of treatment Enterobacteriaceae were identified in only 2 of the 4 cases. Individual microbe counts decreased or fell below detection limit (10(2) cells/g) on day 3 of treatment. Colony forming units (CFUs) of Enterobacteriaceae on day 5 of treatment were similar to those on day 3. After the end of treatment, its CFUs increased. The mean CFU of Enterobacteriaceae on day 10 after the end of treatment increased to about the same level as before dosing. However, some microbes did not revert to pretreatment levels. Of other Gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas sp. increased in one case transiently on day 3 of treatment. After day 3 of treatment, its CFU decreased. Gram-positive microbes showed various changes. Mean CFU of yeast like organism (YLO) increased between day 3 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment and its mean CFU decreased on day 10 after the treatment. As for anaerobes, CFUs of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms and overall anaerobes showed no distinctive changes. Clostridium difficile were detected in two cases. In one case, C. difficile was noted at levels between 1.1 X 10(3) cells/g and 2.0 X 10(6) cells/g at the following sampling times: days 1 and 3 of treatment and days 3, 5, 10 and 20 after the end of treatment. In other case, it was noted at levels of 1.8 X 10(5) cells/g on day 20 after the end of treatment. D-1 toxin was detected in one case before dosing, and in three cases (the concentration of D-1 toxin was 250 ng/g or 500 ng/g) on day after treatment. Enterobacteriaceae in fecal flora of 4 cases given 4 g b.i.d. frequently decreased or fell below detection limit on days 3 and 5 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [In vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
AB  - Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for Serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), Proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive Proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and Providencia (1 mu/ml). The MICs of cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against Acinetobacter (mode MIC 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). The MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 0.5) for Haemophilus and from 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. The MICs for N. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. Methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low MICs ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 0.016). The MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). The MICs for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 1-2). With the exception of Clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode MIC 0.06 for C. Perfringens and 0.03 for Bacteroides fragilis).
TI  - In vitro activity of teicoplanin, vancomycin, A16686, clindamycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of teicoplanin and A16686, two new glycopeptide antibiotics was determined against 196 isolates of anaerobic bacteria. The activity of teicoplanin and A16686, in comparison with that of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin and fusidic acid was 2 to 16 times higher against the gram positive anaerobes, namely, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species and Peptostreptococcus species. However, Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to teicoplanin and A16686 while Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides bivius were found to be sensitive.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria and bacterial infections: perspectives on treatment and resistance in Italy.
AB  - Results of laboratory tests of 2,000 samples obtained from 1984 to 1987 from patients with suspected anaerobic infections and the clinical experience of these patients are reported. Of these samples, 395 were positive for anaerobes; 36.5% of these 395 samples contained single organisms, and 63.5% contained a mixture of anaerobes and aerobes. Abdominal infections were the infections most frequently caused by anaerobes. The Bacteroides fragilis group and strains of Peptostreptococcus were the microorganisms most frequently isolated. In addition, 300 anaerobes isolated from clinical samples at three Italian hospitals were tested for susceptibility to 10 antibiotics (aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole, penicillin, and piperacillin). Imipenem and metronidazole proved to be the most active agents, with low and similar values for the 50% and 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). No microorganism showed resistance to these agents. After imipenem and metronidazole, clindamycin was the most effective agent tested. All other antibiotics tested showed elevated MICs against Bacteroides species and Clostridium difficile. In Italy, cefoxitin still maintains satisfactory activity against the majority of anaerobes tested.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of bismuth subsalicylate.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the in vitro activity of bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) and sodium salicylate (SS) against various groups of pathogenic bacteria. BSS had the greatest activity against Clostridium difficile, which had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 90% of the strains (MIC90) of 128 micrograms/mL. The Bacteroides fragilis group also had a relatively low MIC90 of 512 micrograms/mL. BSS had the least activity against Pseudomonas (MIC90, 6,144 micrograms/mL). SS was as active as BSS against aerobic bacteria but was less active against anaerobic bacteria. The MIC90 values of SS for C. difficile and the B. fragilis group were greater than 8,192 and 4,096 micrograms/mL, respectively. This study demonstrates that BSS has antibacterial activity in vitro at levels that should be achievable in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and susceptibility testing of ofloxacin. Current  status.
AB  - The fluoroquinolone, ofloxacin, exhibits a broad antibacterial spectrum. Based on our data and a review of the literature, ofloxacin inhibited essentially 100 percent of staphylococci, including oxacillin-resistant strains, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis. Ninety-five percent of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to ofloxacin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were less susceptible: 79 and 63 percent, respectively, were susceptible (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC], less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml); 15 and 25 percent, respectively, were intermediate (MIC, 4 micrograms/ml); 3 and 6 percent, respectively, were resistant (MIC, more than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Clostridium spp., including Clostridium difficile, were resistant to ofloxacin, but other anaerobic species, including the Bacteroides fragilis group (over 90 percent) were either susceptible or intermediate to ofloxacin. Ofloxacin is bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations of ofloxacin rarely exceed the MICs by one doubling concentration. A modest inoculum effect has been observed with ofloxacin: MICs with inocula of 10(7) colony-forming units/ml are often two- to fourfold higher than those with inocula of 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units/ml. Susceptible organisms exposed serially to increasing concentrations of nalidixic acid developed increasing resistance to not only nalidixic acid, but also to all other quinolones, including ofloxacin. Correlations of disk diffusion inhibitory zone diameters using the 5-micrograms ofloxacin disk with ofloxacin MICs have been performed, and the disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoints recommended are: susceptible, greater than or equal to 16 mm; intermediate, 13 to 15 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 12 mm. Quality control parameters also are summarized.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - The growth-inhibitory properties of meropenem against anaerobes of clinical importance.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem against anaerobic bacteria was assessed by an  agar dilution procedure. MICs were measured for 449 clinical isolates and reference strains. Meropenem showed excellent activity against both Gram-negative anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), and Gram-positive anaerobes. The MIC90 for Clostridium perfringens was 0.01 mg/l. Meropenem had comparable activity to imipenem against Gram-negative anaerobes but was more active than imipenem against clostridia, including C. difficile (MIC90 2 mg/l compared with 8 mg/l). Meropenem was more active against anaerobes than was cefoxitin, metronidazole or clindamycin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of BMY 40062, a new fluoronaphthyridone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of a new naphthyridone, BMY 40062, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. BMY 40062 showed about threefold more activity than ciprofloxacin showed and four- to eightfold more activity than ofloxacin showed against staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. BMY 40062 showed generally twofold less activity than ciprofloxacin showed against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. but twofold more activity than ofloxacin showed against these organisms. BMY 40062 and ofloxacin were more active than ciprofloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. The antiureaplasmal and antichlamydial activities of BMY 40062 were similar to those of the tetracyclines and were 4- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than those of ciprofloxacin. The in vitro activities of BMY 40062 were influenced by pH and magnesium, although these factors appeared to affect the activity of BMY 40062 against P. aeruginosa to a lesser extent than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. BMY 40062 was found to be bactericidal, and cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones was observed. In mouse protection tests, the efficacy of BMY 40062 reflected its in vitro potency. BMY 40062 exhibited longer half-life, higher maximum concentration in serum, greater area under the curve, and better bioavailability in mice after oral dosing than ciprofloxacin. Compared with ofloxacin, BMY 40062 had a lower maximum concentration in serum but a much longer half-life in mice. BMY 40062 was more effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in penetrating mouse macrophages and killing macrophage-associated Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef compared to moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and  clindamycin against anaerobes.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of flomoxef (6315-S), moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and clindamycin against anaerobes 197 clinical isolates (27 Bacteroides fragilis, 42 B. thetaiotaomicron, 10 B. vulgatus, 7 B. ovatus, 6 B. uniformis, 6 B. distasonis, 7 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, 11 Bacteroides oralis group, 21 Clostridium difficile, 7 C. perfringens, 3 C. sporogenes, 3 Clostridium spp., 33 Propionibacterium acnes, 14 Peptococcaceae) were studied by means of agar dilution tests. The MIC90 of B. fragilis was less than 2 micrograms/ml for flomoxef, less than 4 micrograms/ml for moxalactam, less than 16 micrograms/ml for cefoxitin, less than 128 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime and less than 2 micrograms/ml for clindamycin. The respective MIC90's of B. thetaiotaomicron were less than 64, less than 128, less than 32, less than 256 and 8 micrograms/ml. Strains of the other Bacteroides species and groups were more susceptible to flomoxef and the other antibiotics than B. thetaiotaomicron. Against Clostridium difficile flomoxef (MIC90 less than 4 micrograms/ml) proved to be superior to the other agents tested. Most of the Clostridium strains other than C. difficile were also susceptible to flomoxef; anaerobic grampositive cocci and Propionibacterium acnes were very sensitive (MIC90's less than 1 and less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml, respectively). Its anti-anaerobic activity, together with its efficacy against aerobes, should make flomoxef a useful adjunct to the arsenal of modern antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [In vitro activity of a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - One hundred and one anaerobes isolated from clinical specimen were examined for their susceptibility to amoxicillin, alone or in combination with clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefotaxime, piperacillin and metronidazole. Tested strains were as follow: 90 Bacteroides fragilis group, 16 Bacteroides bivius and 5 Clostridium difficile. For 54 strains combination amoxicillin-sulbactam were also studied. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by agar dilution method on Wilkins-Chalgren agar. All the strains were susceptible to the combination amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The mode MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml and 16 micrograms/ml for amoxicillin alone.
TI  - A multicenter study of the in vitro antianaerobic activity of cefotetan compared  with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro antianaerobic activity of cefotetan was compared with that of chloramphenicol, clindamycin, cefoxitin, and penicillin in a multicenter study. Both agar dilution and broth microdilution testing procedures, as described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), were employed; a total of 1,377 strains were examined. Results were interpreted using the U.S. Food and Drug Administration- and NCCLS-recommended criteria. This study indicates that Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and most other clinically significant anaerobic bacteria are susceptible to cefotetan.
TI  - In vitro activities of two oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, DuP 721 and DuP 105.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of DuP 105 and DuP 721, new oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, were compared with those of beta-lactams and glycopeptides. Ninety percent of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, including methicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 4 micrograms of DuP 105 and 1 microgram of DuP 721 per ml. DuP 721 inhibited hemolytic streptococcus groups A, B, C, F, and G at a concentration of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and it inhibited viridans group streptococci at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium group JK species, anaerobic cocci, and Clostridium spp. including Clostridium difficile. They did not inhibit members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the MIC for 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates was 8 micrograms of DuP 721 per ml.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefotetan compared with that of other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of cefotetan against 430 strains of anaerobic bacteria was compared  with that of cefoxitin, ceftizoxime, clindamycin, metronidazole, and chloramphenicol. Percent susceptible values for the Bacteroides fragilis group were 60, 80, 29, 86, 100, and 100%, respectively. Percent susceptible values for the B. fragilis species were 91, 92, 46, 98, 100, and 100%, respectively. Non-B. fragilis-group Bacteroides species were inhibited very well (90 to 100%) by all drugs except ceftizoxime (80%). Cefotetan and metronidazole were the most active agents against Clostridium difficile. Percent susceptible values for all strains were 72, 79, 44, 82, 93, and 98%, respectively.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef in comparison to other cephalosporins.
AB  - Flomoxef and cefazolin had nearly the same activity against staphylococci, which  was stronger than that of other cephalosporins. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, cefotaxime and cefazolin were more active than flomoxef, but the other cephamycins were less active than flomoxef. In comparison to the other cephalosporins, latamoxef and flomoxef had higher activity against Branhamella catarrhalis, whereas cefotaxime, latamoxef and cefotetan were more active against Haemophilus influenzae. Flomoxef was the only drug exhibiting activity against Clostridium difficile. The activity of flomoxef and latamoxef against Bacteroides fragilis was stronger than that of the other cephalosporins, but Bacteroides bivius was resistant to each of these antibiotics.
TI  - Recovery of pefloxacin in saliva and feces and its action on oral and fecal floras of healthy volunteers.
AB  - Pefloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was given to 10 volunteers in single 400-mg oral doses repeated at 12-h intervals during 7 days. Serum, saliva, and feces samples were collected before and at appropriate intervals after the initiation of treatment. Drug concentrations were determined by bioassay. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the saliva and fecal floras were performed. Mean concentrations in saliva (3.46 micrograms/ml on day 1 and 7.54 micrograms/ml on day 7) were closely related to levels in serum. High concentrations of pefloxacin were found in the feces (645 micrograms/g on day 8). No modification of oral flora was observed. In the fecal flora, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were eliminated between days 2 and 8. The alterations in streptococci and anaerobic flora were not significant; Bacteroides fragilis was more resistant to pefloxacin after treatment. Clostridium difficile was not detected, and there was no overgrowth by yeasts. No side effects were observed.
TI  - In-vitro comparison of roxithromycin and erythromycin against 900 anaerobic bacterial strains.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of roxithromycin was assessed by an agar dilution method against 900 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by five laboratories in England, France, Germany and Japan. Roxithromycin had similar activity to erythromycin against most anaerobic bacteria, the latter being slightly more active against Gram-negative bacilli. Roxithromycin inhibited 53% of the Bacteroides fragilis group strains; the noticeable exception was Bact. thetaiotaomicron, only 17% of strains of which were inhibited by 4 mg/l roxithromycin. In contrast, all isolates of Bacteroides, other than the Bact. fragilis group, and all Mobiluncus isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l of roxithromycin or less. This compound was inactive against half the Fusobacterium strains. Roxithromycin and erythromycin inhibited 65 and 72%, respectively, of 436 strains of Gram-negative anaerobes (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l). Roxithromycin suppressed 97% of non-sporulating Gram-positive to bacilli, 86% of Peptococcoaceae and 95% of clostridia. Two-thirds of Clostridium difficile strains were susceptible to roxithromycin (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l). The activity of roxithromycin against Gram-positive bacilli was identical to that of erythromycin. Overall a concentration of 4 mg/l roxithromycin and erythromycin inhibited 79 and 83%, respectively, of the strains investigated.
TI  - Symposium on antimicrobial agents. Metronidazole.
AB  - Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole derivative, is a unique antimicrobial agent that  is active against both bacterial and parasitic organisms, although only the anaerobic members of these groups are susceptible. It has been used for the treatment of trichomoniasis for almost 30 years and is also effective in amebiasis and giardiasis. More recently, metronidazole has emerged as a principal agent for the treatment of anaerobic infections. It is highly effective against all species of anaerobes except certain non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli and cocci and is the only agent rapidly bactericidal against the Bacteroides fragilis group. The hydroxy metabolite is 65% as effective as metronidazole and may play a major therapeutic role. Clinical studies have substantiated its efficacy for prophylaxis during elective colorectal surgical procedures and the treatment of deep abdominal sepsis (usually in combination with another agent such as an aminoglycoside). Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis and seems to be as effective as vancomycin for treatment of Clostridium difficile-related diarrhea and colitis. Good blood levels are produced after both oral and intravenous administration, and side effects are infrequent and minimal. Metronidazole should not be taken during the first trimester of pregnancy because of concerns about mutagenicity. Tinidazole and ornidazole are recently developed nitroimidazole derivatives that have even greater antimicrobial activity than metronidazole.
TI  - Bowel flora changes in humans receiving cefixime (CL 284,635) or cefaclor.
AB  - Twelve healthy young male subjects received either cefixime, a new oral cephalosporin (CL 284,635), or cefaclor (six subjects on each drug) orally for 2 weeks. In the case of cefixime, single daily doses of 400 mg were taken; with cefaclor, the dosage was 250 mg three times daily. Modest changes in the fecal flora were noted in both drug groups, but the changes were of different types. In the case of cefixime, there was more of an impact on the indigenous flora, and in the case of cefaclor, there was more ingrowth of new flora. With cefixime, Enterobacteriaceae were usually decreased (the decrease in Escherichia coli count was statistically significant), as were counts of clostridia and sometimes Bifidobacterium spp.; the Bacteroides fragilis group was eliminated in one subject. Coincident with these decreases, four subjects had increases in counts of group D streptococci of 3 logs or more. There was new appearance of Clostridium difficile in four subjects and of Staphylococcus aureus in one; four new strains of Enterobacteriaceae appeared. With cefaclor, there was no decrease of E. coli counts; two subjects had elimination of Bifidobacterium spp. There was little change in counts of group D streptococci. On the other hand, there were 13 new strains of Enterobacteriaceae, two of S. aureus, and three of C. difficile.
TI  - The effect of carbon dioxide on the in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of erythromycin and RU-28965 (a novel macrolide antimicrobial with improved pharmacokinetics) was determined against a variety of anaerobic bacteria in anaerobic atmospheres with and without added carbon dioxide. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar (Oxoid, UK) containing saponinlysed horse blood to a final concentration of 10%. The inoculum used was approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere containing 10% carbon dioxide or in hydrogen alone. The MIC of each antimicrobial for each organism examined was determined as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial which completely inhibited growth of the inoculum. The minimum concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of the bacteria examined were also determined. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, B. bivius and Fusobacterium spp. were generally 10-100 times greater when determined in the presence of carbon dioxide than when determined in hydrogen alone. The MICs of erythromycin and RU-28965 for B. melaninogenicus, Peptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile and Propionibacterium acnes were less affected by the presence of carbon dioxide.
TI  - In vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antimicrobial, was determined against a total of 286 anaerobic bacteria including Bacteroides fragilis group (100), B. melaninogenicus (21), B. bivius (16), Fusobacterium spp. (15), Peptococcus spp. (20), Peptostreptococcus spp. (21), Clostridium perfringens (23), C. difficile (41) and Propionibacterium acnes (29). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using an antimicrobial incorporation technique in Wilkins-Chalgren agar approximately 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) contained in 10 microliters Wilkins-Chalgren broth, which was applied to the surface of the agar plates using a multipoint inoculator. Following inoculation, plates were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic atmosphere. Both vancomycin and teicoplanin were highly active against all the Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria examined, 90% of all isolates being inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml of either antimicrobial. Isolates of B. fragilis group and Fusobacterium spp. were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 micrograms/ml) and teicoplanin (MIC90 128 micrograms/ml). Unexpectedly, isolates of B. melaninogenicus and B. bivius which were resistant to vancomycin (MIC90 64 and 128 micrograms/ml respectively) were sensitive to teicoplanin (MIC90 2 and 2 micrograms/ml respectively).
TI  - [In vitro effect of piperacillin, amoxicillin, cefoxitin and metronidazole against obligate anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin and three other antibiotics (amoxicillin, cefoxitin, metronidazole) against 165 strains of obligate anaerobes isolated in hospitals in 1985 and 1986 were determined by the Wilkins-Chalgren agar medium dilution method. Among the 67 strains of Bacteroides fragilis, 98.5% were sensitive to piperacillin (MIC less than or equal to 128 mg/l), 100% were sensitive to metronidazole (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l), 11.9% were resistant to cefoxitin (MIC greater than 32 mg/l) and 46% were resistant to amoxicillin (MIC greater than 16 mg/l). The MIC50 was about 4 mg/l with piperacillin, 8 mg/l with cefoxitin and 0.5 mg/l with metronidazole. All 32 strains of Clostridium perfringens were sensitive to the 4 antibiotics tested, with an MIC50 of about 0.06 mg/l with piperacillin, 0.125 mg/l with amoxicillin and 0.5 mg/l with cefoxitin and metronidazole. All other strains of Clostridium spp. (33 in all) were sensitive to piperacillin and metronidazole; the MIC's were about 0.06 mg/l with piperacillin, 0.25 mg/l with amoxicillin and metronidazole and 0.5 mg/l with cefoxitin. Seven strains (C. innocuum 5, C. difficile 1, C. ramosum 1) were resistant to cefoxitin. All 33 strains of Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus were sensitive to the 4 antibiotics tested. Although metronidazole still is the most effective of anti-anaerobes agents, piperacillin has proved to be effective against most anaerobic bacteria, including B. fragilis. It is clearly superior to amoxicillin and relatively superior to cefoxitin, notably against this species.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are predominant anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are common pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses and orofacial infections. Clostridium perfringens can cause bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause diarrhea or antibiotic-associated colitis.
TI  - Predicting the susceptibility of anaerobes to cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and cefoxitin with the thioglycolate broth disk procedure.
AB  - A variety of clinical anaerobic isolates were tested against cefoperazone (216 strains), cefoxitin (120 strains), and cefotaxime (120 strains) by the thioglycolate anaerobic broth disk method, and the results were compared with the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method. The broth disk and reference breakpoint concentrations were as follows: cefoperazone, 60 and 64 or 30 and 32 micrograms/ml; cefotaxime, 30 and 32 micrograms/ml; cefoxitin, 18 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. Discrepant results were retested to obtain a mode. There was 99% agreement between the broth disk and reference methods for cefotaxime, 98% for cefoperazone with 60- and 64-micrograms/ml breakpoints and 91% with 30- and 32-micrograms/ml breakpoints, and 75% for cefoxitin. All but one of the strains that produced false susceptibility results by broth disk were members of the Bacteroides fragilis group, 1 with cefoperazone using the 60-micrograms/ml concentration, 14 with cefoperazone at the 30-micrograms/ml concentration, and 27 with cefoxitin. One strain of Clostridium difficile produced false susceptibility results to cefoperazone at the 30-micrograms/ml concentration. The lack of agreement between the broth disk and reference methods with cefoxitin may be a reflection of the number of isolates at the 16-micrograms/ml level and that the broth disk breakpoint was slightly higher than this concentration. Increased incubation time did not improve the results significantly.
TI  - Effects of topical clindamycin on intestinal microflora in patients with acne.
AB  - Thirty-two patients with acne completed a randomized, double-blind study using topical 1% clindamycin phosphate or its vehicle applied twice daily for 8 weeks for a study of its effects on the intestinal microflora. Two clindamycin patients and one vehicle patient had Clostridium difficile in stools prior to therapy. Of the remaining twenty-nine patients, four of nineteen patients who used clindamycin and none of ten patients who used vehicle had C. difficile detected during treatment; the difference was not statistically significant. There was no diarrhea in the clindamycin group, even though clostridial cytotoxin was found transiently in two patients. Self-limited diarrhea occurred in one vehicle-treated patient, whose stool culture was negative but whose stool specimen showed a positive reaction for C. difficile cytotoxin. With the use of a bioassay, clindamycin was not detected in urine or stool of any patient. No significant changes in Bacteroides fragilis counts in stools were observed in either group.
TI  - Variations in the anaerobic faecal flora of ten healthy human volunteers with special reference to the Bacteroides fragilis-group and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Ninety nine stool specimens of ten healthy human volunteers were collected over a one year period, and processed anaerobically. The individual variations in intestinal colonization with bacteria of the Bacteroides fragilis-group were detected, using the Bacteroides Bile Esculin medium and an identification scheme for bile-resistant Bacteroides species. Clostridium difficile agar supplemented with cycloserine/cefoxtin was used to detect the incidence of C. difficile in this group. The species of the B. fragilis-group most often detected were: B. vulgatus (in 31 samples from ten persons), B. uniformis (22/9), B. fragilis (19/7). C. difficile was never detected in this group. The mean total anaerobic cultural counts (log) of the ten volunteers varied between 9.94 and 10.91. This shows that interindividual variations in anaerobic cultural counts of about one log are common. In spite of these moderate interindividual variations, intraindividual variations in time of up to three log were detected. The mean Bacteroides cultural counts showed a variation between 8.83 and 10.24. The mean DMCCs of the ten volunteers were between 10.22 and 10.73. We conclude that at least a three to four log difference from the control samples will be required to establish a significant change in anaerobic cultural count due to antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin against 99 Bacteroides fragilis strains and 105 Clostridium difficile strains were determined by the agar dilution method. Ofloxacin was the most potent agent. The MIC for 90% of the B. fragilis and C. difficile strains was 8 mg/l. Ciprofloxacin had MIC90's of 16 mg/l for B. fragilis and C. difficile. The MIC90's of pefloxacin against B. fragilis and C. difficile were 32 mg/l. 90% of the B. fragilis strains were inhibited by 32 mg/l enoxacin, while the MIC90's of enoxacin as well as of norfloxacin against C. difficile were 64 mg/l. The lowest activity against B. fragilis was obtained with norfloxacin (MIC90's of 128 mg/l). Since serum levels of these agents are reported to be between 1 and 3 mg/l after orally administered doses, B. fragilis and C. difficile should be regarded as insusceptible to these quinolone compounds.
TI  - Changes in the cell wall of Clostridium species following passage in animals.
AB  - Morphological changes in clostridial isolates after animal passage with other flora in mixed infections were studied by utilizing a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of 7 clostridial species, and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Abscesses were induced by all 7 Clostridium perfringens and 3 Clostridium butyricum isolates and by some of the other isolates. A thick granular wall prior to animal inoculation was shown only in C. perfringens, C. butyricum, and C. difficile. This structure was observed in other clostridia only following their animal passage alone or when co-inoculated with K. pneumoniae or B. fragilis.
TI  - Effect of imipenem/cilastatin on the colonic microflora.
AB  - The effect of imipenem/cilastatin on the colonic microflora was investigated in 10 patients receiving the drug for six to 11 days. Fecal specimens were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms before, during, and after therapy. Imipenem/cilastatin treatment was associated with minor changes in the colonic flora. A small decrease in the numbers of enterobacteria, enterococci, anaerobic cocci, and organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group was observed. After treatment was discontinued, the microflora returned to normal in all patients, and no new colonization with imipenem-resistant bacteria was seen. No patient had Clostridium difficile or its cytotoxin in feces. No adverse gastrointestinal reactions were registered.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to Sch 34343 and other antibiotics.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 was evaluated against 137 strains of anaerobic bacteria by the agar dilution technique. Sch 34343 was compared with imipenem, cefoxitin, latamoxef (moxalactam), clindamycin and metronidazole. Organisms studied included the Bacteroides fragilis group, other Bacteroides spp., Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile, other Clostridium spp. and anaerobic cocci. Overall, Sch 34343 and imipenem were significantly more active than the other antibiotics against most organisms tested, especially the Bact. fragilis group, including clindamycin-resistant strains. Apart from Cl. difficile, which required up to 8 mg/l of Sch 34343 and imipenem for inhibition, all the strains were inhibited by 1 mg/l of Sch 34343 and by 2 mg/l of imipenem. Of the remaining agents tested, against the Bact. fragilis group metronidazole (2 mg/l to inhibit 90% of the strains) was the most active, followed by cefoxitin (16 mg/l), latamoxef (32 mg/l) and clindamycin (32 mg/l). On the basis of its activity in vitro, Sch 34343 appears to be one of the most promising new antimicrobial agents for the treatment of infections involving anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 for a wide spectrum of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - One hundred and fifty strains of anaerobic bacteria including 45 bacteroides, 19  fusobacteria, 41 cocci, 34 clostridia, and 11 Gram-positive non-sporeforming rods were tested by agar dilution for their susceptibilities to cefoxitin, cefuroxime, latamoxef (moxalactam), penicillin G, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, metronidazole and Sch 34343. Excluding the 34 clostridia, 115 of the 116 remaining strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1 mg/l of Sch 34343. One isolate of Bacteroides fragilis required 32 mg/l for inhibition. All of the 34 clostridia were inhibited by less than or equal to 8 mg/l of Sch 34343: 14 isolates of Clostridium difficile had an MIC50 and an MIC90 of 4 mg/l, whereas the remaining 20 species of clostridia had an MIC50 of 0.125 mg/l and an MIC90 of 2 mg/l. On a weight basis, Sch 34343 was generally more active than any of the seven other antimicrobial agents tested.
TI  - In-vitro activity of Sch 34343 against nosocomial pathogens: methicillin-resistant staphylococci, gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, a new beta-lactam antimicrobial, was studied  in vitro by quantitative broth dilution methods. It was found to have good antibacterial activity against four emerging problem pathogens: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis isolates showing high level resistance to gentamicin (and other aminoglycosides), Clostridium difficile (the cause of pseudomembranous colitis), and Bacteroides fragilis. On the basis of these promising results, Sch 34343 merits further in-vitro and in-vivo study to define its potential usefulness in treatment of infections with these pathogens in humans.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - Evaluation of the in-vitro antibacterial activity of Sch 34343.
AB  - The in-vitro activity (as measured by geometric mean MICs, mg/l) of Sch 34343 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was compared with that of 14 other selected beta-lactam antibiotics including aztreonam, latamoxef (moxalactam), ceftazidime and imipenem. Sch 34343 had good activity (less than 2 mg/l) against most Gram-negative aerobic bacteria whether or not they contained high levels of plasmid-mediated or chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases. It was slightly less potent against strains of Morganella and Serratia (less than 4 mg/l) and inactive against Pseudomonas (greater than 64 mg/l). A very small inoculum effect was observed against strains containing beta-lactamases indicating stability. Unlike the third-generation cephalosporins, Sch 34343 had excellent activity (less than or equal to 0.18 mg/l) against staphylococci, comparable to that of imipenem and ampicillin. While Sch 34343 had equally good potency (0.17 mg/l) against penicillinase-positive staphylococci, it was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococci (greater than or equal to 35 mg/l). Sch 34343 also had good activity against streptococci. The most unusual aspect of the in-vitro activity was its activity against Bacteroides (including Bact. fragilis) and other anaerobes. Sch 34343 had mean MICs less than or equal to mg/l for all Bacteroides and Clostridium spp. tested except CI. difficile (3.4 mg/l).
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of cefotetan against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefotetan, a new cephamycin, was assessed against a total of 336 strains of anaerobic bacteria by means of an agar dilution procedure and compared with that of cefoxitin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, clindamycin and metronidazole. Overall clindamycin and metronidazole were the most active of the test compounds. Cefotetan showed good activity against anaerobic cocci and clostridia, except for Clostridium difficile (MIC90 = 16 mg/l), although it was comparatively less active than the other beta-lactams against anaerobic cocci. In the case of the Gram-negative anaerobes, cefotetan showed moderate activity comparable to that of cefoxitin; against the 120 test strains of Bacteroides fragilis both cefotetan and cefoxitin were markedly more active than the penicillins. In studies with antibiotic combinations, cefotetan + cefsulodin showed marked synergy (FIC index less than 0.3) against the majority of strains of Bact. fragilis tested.
TI  - Effect of aspoxicillin on anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Aspoxicillin (ASPC), a semisynthetic penicillin has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Its in vitro antibacterial activity was less than those of cefoxitin against Peptostreptococcus and Veillonella, but was significantly high against Bacteroides fragilis, one of the most clinically important anaerobe. The therapeutic and/or protective effect of ASPC in experimental subcutaneous abscess or experimental intraabdominal mixed infection due to beta-lactamase producing B. fragilis and non-producing Escherichia coli were much stronger than those of ticarcillin. In order to account the superiority of ASPC in vivo, the effects of ASPC and other beta-lactams on B. fragilis were compared and the results were analyzed in relation to their in vitro bactericidal activities, stability against the beta-lactamase, binding properties with penicillin-binding proteins and pharmacokinetic properties. Interestingly, administration of ASPC did not increase the bacterial counts of Clostridium difficile in caecal contents, but piperacillin, ticalcillin, carbenicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime increased the counts.
TI  - In vitro activity of Sch 34343 and cefbuperazone against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic, and cefbuperazone,  a new cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against 459 clinical anaerobic bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of imipenem and cefoxitin, respectively, by an agar dilution method. Both penems showed potent and similar activity against all anaerobic bacteria tested, particularly Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens. All organisms except a single strain of Fusobacterium necrogenes were inhibited by an 8 micrograms/ml concentration of either Sch 34343 or imipenem. Overall, gram-positive bacilli, particularly Lactobacillus species, Clostridium difficile, and Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces species, were relatively more resistant to either penem than other genera of anaerobic bacteria tested. Cefbuperazone demonstrated only modest activity against a wide spectrum of anaerobic bacteria. It had excellent and selective activity against B. fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus but was highly inactive against Bacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron within the B. fragilis group. Both cephamycins showed virtually no activity against C. difficile and Lactobacillus spp. Although cefbuperazone was more active against Bifidobacterium spp., it had less activity against Fusobacterium spp., Eubacterium spp., and all Bacteroides spp. other than B. fragilis and B. vulgatus.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefminox against anaerobes.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefminox (CMNX) against anaerobic bacteria was studied in vitro. The results are as follows: 1. CMNX exerted antibacterial activity against a wide range of anaerobes, excluding Clostridium innocuum. The antibacterial activity of CMNX against Bacteroides fragilis was comparable to that of latamoxef and superior to cefoxitin, but CMNX's activity against anaerobic cocci was slightly inferior to cefoxitin's; 2. A comparison of the MICs and MBCs of CMNX indicated that this drug exerts a complete bactericidal effect at a concentration which inhibits the growth of bacteria; 3. CMNX was found to be stable to the beta-lactamases produced by B. fragilis; 4. CMNX exerted an antibacterial activity against C. difficile.
TI  - [Sensitivity of obligate anaerobes to ofloxacin, pefloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin].
AB  - The in vitro activity of four new quinolones against 355 obligate anaerobes was investigated. MICs were determined using the reference method of Sutter et al. [14]. The four fluorinated quinolones tested differ from nalidixic acid which is inactive on most anaerobes except for some Clostridium perfringens strains. All strains tested were inhibited by 64 and 16 mg/l pefloxacin and ofloxacin respectively. Except for Bacteroides, all strains were inhibited by 64 mg/l norfloxacin or enoxacin. Clostridium strains other than C. perfringens exhibited heterogeneity; C. difficile and C. ramosum had the highest MICs. Bacteroides fragilis proved less susceptible to fluorinated quinolones than the other obligate anaerobes. Ofloxacin showed the greatest activity, with 4 mg/l inhibiting 100% of C. perfringens and 83% of all anaerobes investigated.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefbuperazone against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefbuperazone was compared with that of cefoxitin, moxalactam, and piperacillin against 305 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Piperacillin was the most active overall, inhibiting 97% of all anaerobes tested at 128 micrograms/ml. Cefbuperazone had poor activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium difficile (43 and 0% susceptible, respectively) but good activity (90.5%) against all other anaerobic bacterial species tested.
TI  - The influence of single dose intravenous antibiotics on faecal flora and emergence of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The influence of a single intravenous dose of antibiotic on faecal flora and the  emergence of Clostridium difficile was studied in volunteers. Seventy-eight volunteers (13 groups of 6 receiving 5 penicillins and 8 cephalosporins) were given a single intravenous dose of antibiotic. Results were compared with a control group of 6 volunteers who did not receive an antibiotic. Changes in the faecal flora were monitored over two weeks. Only cephalosporins were associated with emergence of Cl. difficile, penicillins and controls were not. Frequency of emergence of Cl. difficile in the 6 volunteers in each of the cephalosporin groups were as follows: cephaloridine 0, cephazolin, 1 cefuroxime 1, cefoxitin 2, cefotaxime 2, latamoxef 3, ceftriaxone 2, cefotetan 4. Latamoxef (moxalactam) was associated with a significant rise in total aerobic bacterial counts largely due to increased counts of enterococci. Cefotetan eliminated Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis from the faecal flora three days after administration.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The MICs of MT-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the MICs of MT-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of MT-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive Proteus species, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Clostridium perfringens. In the treatment of systemic infections in mice, MT-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. It was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the MBCs than with the MICs. As the serum levels of MT-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of MT-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
TI  - Alterations in human fecal flora, including ingrowth of Clostridium difficile, related to cefoxitin therapy.
AB  - To evaluate the effects of parenteral cefoxitin therapy on human fecal flora, we  cultured fecal specimens obtained from six patients before, during, and after therapy and used standard methods to identify and quantify all microorganisms. The major changes (observed in at least three patients) included the acquisition or proliferation of group D Streptococcus species, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, cefoxitin-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas species, and various species of the Bacteroides fragilis group. The most striking finding was ingrowth of Clostridium difficile, noted in five of the six patients. There was concomitant eradication or decrease of cefoxitin-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae family members, Bacteroides species other than the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species other than C. difficile, and Lactobacillus species. These marked alterations of fecal flora may have important clinical consequences.
TI  - Polymicrobial septicaemia due to Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of MT-141 against anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new cephamycin, against anaerobic bacteria were compared with those of cefmetazole (CMZ), cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and cefazolin to obtain the following results. MT-141 showed high activity against a wide variety of anaerobic bacteria including B. fragilis and C. difficile except for Eubacterium lentum, E. aerofaciens and B. furcosus. Antibacterial activity of MT-141 against anaerobic bacteria was almost independent of inoculum size, medium, pH and serum addition. In vitro development of resistance of MT-141 against P. variabilis and B. fragilis was comparable to that of CMZ. Successive parenteral administration of MT-141 into mice did not cause abnormal proliferation of C. difficile. MT-141 showed excellent therapeutic effect against experimental subcutaneous abscess in mice caused by B. fragilis.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in childhood.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Anaerobes can be isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. Frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. The genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) OFFteroides, Clostridium, gram-positive cocci, Fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (Eubacterium, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (Veillonella and Acidaminococcus). Clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. Clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. Clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. Fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. Recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.
TI  - [In vitro activity of several cytostatic drugs against aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria].
AB  - The human normal intestinal flora prevents the colonization of exogenous bacteria, maintaining a constant microecology: this property is called "colonization resistance". In leukemia patients antibiotics used for prevention and/or therapy of infectious episodes can alter the intestinal microecology, so that the gut can represent the trigger zone for generalized septicemia. Moreover cytotoxic drugs used in these patients can favour intestinal disturbances. In our study we evaluated the in vitro activity of three commonly used antineoplastic drugs (Daunorubicin, Cytosine arabinoside, Methotrexate) against aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria and Clostridium difficile that is the aetiological agent of pseudomembranous colitis. Daunorubicin proved to be the most active inhibiting, in concentration ranging from 16 to 128 micrograms/ml, 50% of Bacteroides strains and 90% of Clostridium difficile and Enterococci strains tested. Methotrexate showed activity only against some Bacteroides strains, while Cytosine arabinoside had no activity at all. We conclude that in these patients the use of these drugs may represent another factor of risk altering the intestinal flora and so lowering the colonization resistance.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of four antibiotics in anaerobic pulmonary infection. An experimental model in rabbits.
AB  - The efficacy of cefoxitin, mezlocillin, latamoxef and metronidazole in anaerobic  lung infection was studied using a rabbit model. A mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus morbillorum, Eubacterium lentum and Fusobacterium nucleatum was inoculated transtracheally to produce infection within the lung. Mezlocillin was most effective, achieving bacteriologic cure in 5 out of 8 animals. With cefoxitin therapy, 4 out of 8 became bacteriologically sterile. Severe diarrhea with elevated titers of Clostridium difficile toxin was noted in most cefoxitin-treated animals. Latamoxef- and metronidazole-treated animals had apparently healed lesions, but cultures were positive in 6 and 7 out of 8 in each group, respectively. The commonest pathogen isolated in the last two groups was P. morbillorum. The therapeutic superiority of mezlocillin over metronidazole and latamoxef was statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05).
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria and beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - This review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and beta-lactam antibiotics. Data on the susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics of anaerobic isolates in Sweden during 1983 is presented. Among the different bacterial groups, Clostridium perfringens, anaerobic cocci and curved rods were found to be very susceptible to the beta-lactams tested. C. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin, piperacillin and imipenem, but resistant to the second and third generation of cephalosporins. Most fusobacteria were susceptible to the beta-lactam antibiotics investigated. However, some strains were found to be resistant to the penicillins. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, imipenem had the best activity whereas moxalactam, piperacillin and cefoxitin had good activities. The majority of the Bacteroides non-fragilis strains were still susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant, especially to the penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years. The known mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance in anaerobic bacteria involve production of beta-lactamases, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins and blocked penetration of beta-lactams through the outer membranes of anaerobes. The presence of beta-lactamases in various Bacteroides and Clostridium species is reported as well as the characteristics of the different beta-lactamases encountered. The role of penicillin-binding proteins and penetration barrier in beta-lactam resistance is also discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in Sweden in 1983.
AB  - This review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility. Data on the susceptibility to different antimicrobials of anaerobic isolates in Sweden during 1983 is presented. Among the different bacterial groups, Clostridium perfringens, propionibacteria, anaerobic cocci and curved rods were found to be susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin and chloramphenicol. C. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin and imipenem, but resistant to cefoxitin. Most C. difficile strains were also susceptible to clindamycin and fusidic acid, while all strains were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. The majority of the fusobacteria were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. However, some strains were found to be resistant to penicillins. Against the Bacteroides fragilis group, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole and imipenem had the best activity, whereas piperacillin and cefoxitin showed good activities. Most Bacteroides non-fragilis strains were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. However, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant especially to penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years.
TI  - [Efficacy of tinidazole against anaerobes in comparison with metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and lamoxactam].
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of tinidazole, metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and moxalactam was determined against 150 isolates of clinically important anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius and Clostridium perfringens by means of agar dilution tests. The members of 18 gramnegative and 14 grampositive species were inhibited by tinidazole at less than or equal to 0,01-8 micrograms/ml thus being without exception susceptible to the drug. A similar in vitro activity was recorded for metronidazole and ornidazole. Though cefoxitin and moxalactam generally had a good in vitro activity against most anaerobic species, single strains of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis, Clostridium difficile and Eubacterium rectale were resistant to these drugs. With regard to its in vitro activity, tinidazole seems to be a promising substance for the therapy of anaerobic infections.
TI  - [Anaerobic effect of tinidazol compared with metronidazol, ornidazol, cefoxitin and lamoxactam].
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of tinidazole, metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and moxalactam was determined against 150 isolates of clinically important anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius and Clostridium perfringens by means of agar dilution tests. The members of 18 gramnegative and 14 grampositive species were inhibited by tinidazole at less than or equal to 0,01-8 micrograms/ml thus being without exception susceptible to the drug.

Though cefoxitin and moxalactam generally had a good in vitro activity against most anaerobic species, single strains of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis, Clostridium difficile and Eubacterium rectale were resistant to these drugs. With regard to its in vitro activity, tinidazole seems to be a promising substance for the therapy of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Piperacillin sodium: antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions.
AB  - Piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing S. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis. Piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella sp and Pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. Like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. The primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. Piperacillin has been approved for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. As with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. The usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. It is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. Less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. Overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. Evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Aspects on antibacterial treatment of anaerobic infections.
AB  - A review is given of current antibiotic treatment of anaerobic infections. It is  emphasized that infections with Bacteroides fragilis constitute the main problem, virtually all other anaerobe organisms of clinical significance are sensitive to penicillin. Particularly useful antibiotics for infections with B. fragilis are cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and the nitroimidazoles. Vancomycin is the drug of choice for pseudomembranous colitis provoked by Clostridium difficile.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of new beta-lactam antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Several new beta-lactam antimicrobial agents have been introduced in the last few years. In this investigation, the in vitro activities of several recently introduced cephalosporins (cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime), moxalactam, and N-formimidoyl thienamycin were compared with those of cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against 203 strains of anaerobic bacteria. At achievable serum levels, all of the antimicrobial agents were active against essentially 100% of the strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Clostridium perfringens, Leptotrichia buccalis, and species of Selenomonas, Veillonella, and Eubacterium. Clindamycin, metronidazole, and N-formimidoyl thienamycin were the most active agents against the Bacteroides fragilis group, inhibiting all strains at concentrations which can be achieved in serum. Of the remaining agents tested against the B. fragilis group, cefoxitin (which required 64 mug/ml to inhibit 90% of the strains) was the most active, followed by cefoperazone (128 mug/ml), cefotaxime (128 mug/ml), moxalactam (128 mug/ml), ceftizoxime (256 mug/ml), and ceftazidime (>256 mug/ml). Important differences in cephalosporin susceptibility among species of the B. fragilis group were observed. Metronidazole and N-formimidoyl thienamycin were the most active drugs against species of clostridia other than C. perfringens; the other antibiotics displayed poor activity, although this is partly due to inclusion of a relatively large number of strains of Clostridium difficile which were very resistant to several of the cephalosporins. Only metronidazole was active against all species of Fusobacterium. Clindamycin and N-formimidoyl thienamycin displayed excellent activity against gram-positive, non-spore-forming bacilli, requiring </=8 mug/ml to inhibit 100% of the strains. Ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and moxalactam were bactericidal for 25 strains of B. fragilis at concentrations equal or close to those required for inhibition. On the basis of its activity in vitro, N-formimidoyl thienamycin appears to be the most promising of the new beta-lactam antibiotics for the treatment of infections involving anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to nitroimidazoles.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 355 Swedish clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria to three nitroimidazole drugs was determined by the agar dilution method. The drugs were metronidazole, tinidazole and ornidazole. In addition the in vitro susceptibility of 32 strains of clostridium difficile to metronidazole was determined. Gram-negative rods and clostridia were inhibited by 4 microgram/ml or less of all three compounds except one strain of C. difficile, which was not inhibited by 16 microgram/ml of metronidazole. Against strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, tinidazole was slightly more active than metronidazole and ornidazole. Only about 70% of anaerobic cocci (peptococci and peptostreptococci) were inhibited by 4 microgram/ml of the three drugs, whereas the remaining isolates were resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than or equal to 8 microgram/ml). Anaerobic streptococci were not included in this material. Actinomyces, arachnia and propionibacteria were resistant to the nitroimidazole drugs. At achievable serum levels, nitroimidazoles inhibited the majority of anaerobic bacteria found with greatest frequency in anaerobic infections.
TI  - The immune response in a patient to an infection with Bacteroides fragilis ss. fragilis and Clostridium difficile.
AB  
TI  - Effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  - In the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. Of the species tested, Bacteroides oralis and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium difficile, a Neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. A group K streptococcus and B. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. Mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. A Peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. When this strain was combined with two Clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. This polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. No net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
