TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.
