TI  - Precision genome engineering in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Innovative new genome engineering technologies for manipulating chromosomes have  appeared in the last decade. One of these technologies, recombination mediated genetic engineering (recombineering) allows for precision DNA engineering of chromosomes and plasmids in Escherichia coli. Single-stranded DNA recombineering (SSDR) allows for the generation of subtle mutations without the need for selection and without leaving behind any foreign DNA. In this review we discuss the application of SSDR technology in lactic acid bacteria, with an emphasis on key factors that were critical to move this technology from E. coli into Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactococcus lactis. We also provide a blueprint for how to proceed if one is attempting to establish SSDR technology in a lactic acid bacterium. The emergence of CRISPR-Cas technology in genome engineering and its potential application to enhancing SSDR in lactic acid bacteria is discussed. The ability to perform precision genome engineering in medically and industrially important lactic acid bacteria will allow for the genetic improvement of strains without compromising safety.
TI  - Coexpression and secretion of endoglucanase and phytase genes in Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - A multifunctional transgenic Lactobacillus with probiotic characteristics and an  ability to degrade beta-glucan and phytic acid (phytate) was engineered to improve nutrient utilization, increase production performance and decrease digestive diseases in broiler chickens. The Bacillus subtilis WL001 endoglucanase gene (celW) and Aspergillus fumigatus WL002 phytase gene (phyW) mature peptide (phyWM) were cloned into an expression vector with the lactate dehydrogenase promoter of Lactobacillus casei and the secretion signal peptide of the Lactococcus lactis usp45 gene. This construct was then transformed into Lactobacillus reuteri XC1 that had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of broilers. Heterologous enzyme production and feed effectiveness of this genetically modified L. reuteri strain were investigated and evaluated. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the molecular mass of phyWM and celW was approximately 48.2 and 55 kDa, respectively, consistent with their predicted molecular weights. Endoglucanase and phytase activities in the extracellular fraction of the transformed L. reuteri culture were 0.68 and 0.42 U/mL, respectively. Transformed L. reuteri improved the feed conversion ratio of broilers from 21 to 42 days of age and over the whole feeding period. However, there was no effect on body weight gain and feed intake of chicks. Transformed L. reuteri supplementation improved levels of ash, calcium and phosphorus in tibiae at day 21 and of phosphorus at day 42. In addition, populations of Escherichia coli, Veillonella spp. and Bacteroides vulgatus were decreased, while populations of Bifidobacterium genus and Lactobacillus spp. were increased in the cecum at day 21.
TI  - High-level expression and characterization of recombinant acid urease for enzymatic degradation of urea in rice wine.
AB  - Ethylcarbamate, a carcinogenic compound, is formed from urea and ethanol in rice  wine, and enzymatic elimination of urea is always attractive. In the present work, we amplified the acid urease gene cluster ureABCEFGD from Lactobacillus reuteri CICC6124 and constructed robust Lactococcus lactis cell factories for the production of acid urease. The titer of the recombinant acid urease was increased from 1,550 to 11,560 U/L by optimization of the cultivation process. Meanwhile, the enzyme showed satisfied properties toward urea elimination in the rice wine model system. By incubating the enzyme (50 U/L) at 20 degrees C for 60 h, about 95.8% of urea in rice wine was removed. Interestingly, this acid urease also exhibited activity toward ethylcarbamate. The results demonstrated that this recombinant acid urease has great potential in the elimination of urea in rice wine.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Characterization of alpha-galacto-oligosaccharides formed via heterologous expression of alpha-galactosidases from Lactobacillus reuteri in Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - alpha-Galacto-oligosaccharides (alpha-GOS) are produced by transgalactosylation reactions of alpha-galactosidase (alpha-Gal) or by conversion of raffinose family oligosaccharides by levansucrase. Similarly to beta-GOS, alpha-GOS have the potential to mimic glycan receptors on eukaryotic cells and act as molecular decoys to prevent bacterial infection; however, data on transgalactosylation reactions of alpha-Gal remain scarce. The alpha-Gal gene sequence from Lactobacillus reuteri was cloned into an alpha-Gal negative strain of Lactococcus lactis. Transgalactosylation reactions were achieved using crude cell extracts with melibiose or raffinose as galactosyl donor and fucose, N-acetylglucosamine or lactose as galactosyl acceptor. The composition, sequence and most linkage types of alpha-GOS formed with acceptors saccharides were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. alpha-Gal of Lactobacillus reuteri formed (1 --> 3)-, (1 --> 4)- or (1 --> 6)-linked alpha-GOS but exhibited a preference for formation of (1 --> 6)-linkages. Fucose, N-acetylglucosamine and lactose were suitable galactosyl acceptors for alpha-Gal of L. reuteri, resulting in formation of (1 --> 3)-, (1 --> 4)- or (1 --> 6)-linked hetero-oligosaccharides. By determining the structural specificity of alpha-Gal and increasing the variation of oligosaccharides produced by introducing alternative acceptor sugars, this work supports further studies to assess alpha-GOS pathogen adhesion prevention in mammalian hosts.
TI  - The dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of Obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - Obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from Uganda namely: Obutoko, Enturire, Ekitiribita and Obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. Knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. Culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and mixed DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified ribosomal RNA genes were used to study the bacteria and yeast diversity of Obushera. The pH dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire whereas that of Ekitiribita decreased to 4.4 after 4 days. Counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. LAB and yeast isolates were identified by rRNA gene sequence analysis. LAB isolates included: Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus (S.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Weisella (W.) confusa. DGGE indicated predominance of S. gallolyticus, S. infantarius subsp. infantarius, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, W. confusa, Lb. reuteri, Fructobacillus spp., L. lactis and L. lactis. Yeast isolates included Clavispora lusitaniae, Cyberlindnera fabianii, Issatchenkia orientalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DGGE indicated predominance of S. cerevisiae in Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and also detected Pichia spp. and I. orientalis in Obutoko. Obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and later by Lactococcus spp. Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillus spp. were also detected in Ekitiribita. Development of starters for Obushera may require combinations of LAB and S. cerevisiae for Obutoko, Enturire and Obuteire and LAB for Ekitiribita.
TI  - Exploring optimization parameters to increase ssDNA recombineering in Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering is a technology which is used to make  subtle changes in the chromosome of several bacterial genera. Cells which express a single-stranded DNA binding protein (RecT or Bet) are transformed with an oligonucleotide which is incorporated via an annealing and replication-dependent mechanism. By in silico analysis we identified ssDNA binding protein homologs in the genus Lactobacillus and Lactococcus lactis. To assess whether we could further improve the recombineering efficiency in Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 we expressed several RecT homologs in this strain. RecT derived from Enterococcus faecalis CRMEN 19 yielded comparable efficiencies compared with a native RecT protein, but none of the other proteins further increased the recombineering efficiency. We successfully improved recombineering efficiency 10-fold in L. lactis by increasing oligonucleotide concentration combined with the use of oligonucleotides containing phosphorothioate-linkages (PTOs). Surprisingly, neither increased oligonucleotide concentration nor PTO linkages enhanced recombineering in L. reuteri 6475. To emphasize the utility of this technology in improving probiotic features we modified six bases in a transcriptional regulatory element region of the pdu-operon of L. reuteri 6475, yielding a 3-fold increase in the production of the antimicrobial compound reuterin. Directed genetic modification of lactic acid bacteria through ssDNA recombineering will simplify strain improvement in a way that, when mutating a single base, is genetically indistinguishable from strains obtained through directed evolution.
TI  - High efficiency recombineering in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The ability to efficiently generate targeted point mutations in the chromosome without the need for antibiotics, or other means of selection, is a powerful strategy for genome engineering. Although oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering (ssDNA recombineering) has been utilized in Escherichia coli for over a decade, the successful adaptation of ssDNA recombineering to gram-positive bacteria has not been reported. Here we describe the development and application of ssDNA recombineering in lactic acid bacteria. Mutations were incorporated in the chromosome of Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactococcus lactis without selection at frequencies ranging between 0.4% and 19%. Whole genome sequence analysis showed that ssDNA recombineering is specific and not hypermutagenic. To highlight the utility of ssDNA recombineering we reduced the intrinsic vancomymycin resistance of L. reuteri >100-fold. By creating a single amino acid change in the D-Ala-D-Ala ligase enzyme we reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration for vancomycin from >256 to 1.5 microg/ml, well below the clinically relevant minimum inhibitory concentration. Recombineering thus allows high efficiency mutagenesis in lactobacilli and lactococci, and may be used to further enhance beneficial properties and safety of strains used in medicine and industry. We expect that this work will serve as a blueprint for the adaptation of ssDNA recombineering to other gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Construction of theta-type shuttle vector for Leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pCB42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  - The pCB42 plasmid from Leuconostoc citreum CB2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was constructed. The pCB42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low G+C content, and no single-stranded DNA intermediates during replication, which indicates that pCB42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. In silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 DNA-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. The fragment encompassing ORF5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. This plasmid was capable of replicating in various LAB, including L. citreum, L. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Weissella confusa, and Oenococcus oeni. The LAB-E. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pCB42 and pEK104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pLeuCM42, showed a high segregational stability in L. citreum CB2567 after 100 generations of cell division. By using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from Lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, L. citreum CB2567. The pLeuCM42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering of various strains of LAB.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in Inner Mongolia of China.
AB  - Sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of Inner Mongolia in China.  It has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. In this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in Inner Mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) by classical biochemical tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay of recA gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor Tu). The results revealed that all the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus (L.) paracasei (38 strains), L. fermentum (28 strains), L. plantarum (7 strains), L. brevis (4 strains), L. reuteri (2 strains), L. amylolyticus (1 strain), Enterococcus (E.) faecalis (3 strains), E. italicus (2 strains) or Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). The predominant LAB were L. casei and L. fermentum in sour congee samples. The diversity of LAB derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and RFLP patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the L. casei group.
TI  - Utilization of UF-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Four lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacilus casei and Lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in MRS broth and three lactococci strains (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in M17 broth. L. reuteri and S. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 U/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. The maximum production of beta-galactosidase by L. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial pH 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g N/L and incubation temperature at 30 degrees C/24 hrs to give 6.31 U/ml. While in case of S. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (KH2PO4:K2HPO4, g/L), at initial pH 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate (0.66g N/L) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees C for 24 hrs to give 7.85 U/ml.
TI  - Obesity-associated gut microbiota is enriched in Lactobacillus reuteri and depleted in Bifidobacterium animalis and Methanobrevibacter smithii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with increased health risk and has been associated with alterations in bacterial gut microbiota, with mainly a reduction in Bacteroidetes, but few data exist at the genus and species level. It has been reported that the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genus representatives may have a critical role in weight regulation as an anti-obesity effect in experimental models and humans, or as a growth-promoter effect in agriculture depending on the strains. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To confirm reported gut alterations and test whether Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium species found in the human gut are associated with obesity or lean status, we analyzed the stools of 68 obese and 47 controls targeting Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium animalis and seven species of Lactobacillus by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and culture on a Lactobacillus-selective medium. FINDINGS: In qPCR, B. animalis (odds ratio (OR)=0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-1.01; P=0.056) and M. smithii (OR=0.76; 95% CI 0.59-0.97; P=0.03) were associated with normal weight whereas Lactobacillus reuteri (OR=1.79; 95% CI 1.03-3.10; P=0.04) was associated with obesity. CONCLUSION: The gut microbiota associated with human obesity is depleted in M. smithii. Some Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus species were associated with normal weight (B. animalis) while others (L. reuteri) were associated with obesity. Therefore, gut microbiota composition at the species level is related to body weight and obesity, which might be of relevance for further studies and the management of obesity. These results must be considered cautiously because it is the first study to date that links specific species of Lactobacillus with obesity in humans.
TI  - Expression of Lactobacillus reuteri Pg4 collagen-binding protein gene in Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 increases its adhesion ability to Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The collagen-binding protein gene cnb was cloned from the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri strain Pg4. The DNA sequence of the cnb gene (792 bp) has an open reading frame encoding 263 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 28.5 kDa. The cnb gene was constructed so as to constitutively express under the control of the Lactococcus lactis lacA promoter and was transformed into Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393, a strain isolated from dairy products with poor ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopic and flow cytometric analysis of the transformed strain Lb. casei pNZ-cnb indicated that Cnb was displayed on its cell surface. Lb. casei pNZ-cnb not only showed a higher ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells but also exhibited a higher competition ability against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes adhesion to Caco-2 cells than Lb. casei ATCC 393.
TI  - Comparison of expression vectors in Lactobacillus reuteri strains.
AB  - The synthesis of heterologous proteins in lactobacilli is strongly influenced by  the promoter selected for the expression. In addition, the activity of the promoters themselves may vary among different bacterial hosts. Three different promoters were investigated for their capability to drive enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in Lactococcus lactis spp. cremoris MG1363, in Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016(T) and in five L. reuteri strains isolated from chicken crops. The promoters of the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer protein gene (slp), L. acidophilus lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhL) and enterococcal rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase gene (ermB) were fused to the coding sequence of EGFP and inserted into the backbone of the pTRKH3 shuttle vector (pTRKH3-slpGFP, pTRKH3-ldhGFP, pTRKH3-ermGFP). Besides conventional analytical methods, a new quick fluorimetric approach was set up to quantify the EGFP fluorescence in transformed clones using the Qubit() fluorometer. ermB proved to be the most effective promoter in L. reuteri isolates, producing 3.90 x 10(-7) g of fluorescent EGFP (mL OD(stationary culture))(-1). Under the same conditions, the ldhL promoter produced 2.66 x 10(-7) g of fluorescent EGFP (mL OD(stationary culture))(-1). Even though the slp promoter was efficient in L. lactis spp. cremoris MG1363, it was nearly inactive both in L. reuteri DSM 20016(T) and in L. reuteri isolates.
TI  - High-level expression of Lactobacillus beta-galactosidases in Lactococcus lactis  using the food-grade, nisin-controlled expression system NICE.
AB  - In this work the overlapping genes (lacL and lacM) encoding heterodimeric beta-galactosidases from Lactobacillus reuteri , Lb. acidophilus , Lb. sakei , and Lb. plantarum were cloned into two different nisin-controlled expression (NICE) vectors and expressed using Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 and NZ3900 as hosts. The lacL gene, encoding the large subunit of the beta-galactosidases, was fused translationally downstream of the nisin-inducible promoter nisA. Chloramphenicol was employed as selection marker for the standard system using L. lactis NZ9000, whereas lactose utilization based on the complementation of the lacF gene was used as a dominant selection marker for the food-grade system employing L. lactis NZ3900. Comparison of the standard and the food-grade expression system, differing only in their selection markers, gave considerable differences in volumetric beta-galactosidase activity, ranging from 1.17 to 14 kU/L of fermentation broth, depending on both the origin of the lacLM genes and the selection marker used. The occurrence of codons less frequently used by L. lactis especially at the beginning of the lacL gene could be an explanation for the significant differences between the expression levels of lacLM from different origins, while plasmid stability might cause the difference obtained when employing the different selection markers.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a novel tuf promoter from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403.
AB  - Genetic engineering of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) requires a reliable gene expression system. Especially, a stable promoter is an important genetic element to induce gene expression in such a system. We report on a novel tuf promoter (Ptuf) of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 that was screened and selected through analysis of previously published microarray data. Ptuf activity was examined and compared with three other known lactococcal promoters (PdnaJ, PpfkA, and Pusp45) using different bacteria as expression hosts. Each promoter was, respectively, fused to the promoterless and modified bmpB gene as a reporter, and we estimated promoter activity through BmpB expression. All promoters were active in IL1403, and Ptuf activity was strongest among them. The activity of each promoter differed by host bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum Lb25, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC23272, and Escherichia coli Top10F'). Ptuf had the highest activity in IL1403 when growth reached late log phase. The activity of each promoter correlated with the expression of each cognate gene in the microarray data (R (2) = 0.7186, P = 0.06968). This study revealed that novel food-grade promoters such as IL1403 Ptuf can be selected from microarray data for food-grade microorganisms and Ptuf can be used to develop a reliable gene expression system in L. lactis.
TI  - A method for the identification of proteins secreted by lactic acid bacteria grown in complex media.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are known for their special nutritional requirements,  being usually cultured in complex media to achieve optimal growth. In this paper, a protocol based on trichloroacetic acid precipitation of peptides and proteins is presented. The method has been tested on four probiotic LAB strains grown in De Man Rogosa Sharpe (MRS) broth, a complex medium that is often used for the culture of such bacteria. This protocol allowed the detection of 19 proteins after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 10 of them being successfully identified by tandem MS. Thereafter, the 10 were found to be secreted or surface associated by bioinformatic means. In conclusion, this work supplies a method for the identification of proteins secreted by LAB, allowing discrimination between the proteins present in the MRS and those produced by probiotic LAB.
TI  - Volatile sulfur compounds produced by probiotic bacteria in the presence of cysteine or methionine.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the abilities of various probiotic bacteria to produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to food flavour and aroma. METHODS AND RESULTS: Probiotic strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC55730 and L. reuteri BR11), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ATCC4797, L. plantarum ATCC14917 and Lactococcus lactis MG1363 were incubated with either cysteine or methionine. Volatile compounds were captured, identified and quantified using a sensitive solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique combined with gas chromatography coupled to a pulsed flame photometric detector (SPME/GC/PFPD). Several VSCs were identified including H(2)S, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. The VSC profiles varied substantially for different strains of L. plantarum and L. reuteri and it was found that L. reuteri ATCC55730 and L. lactis MG1363 produced the lowest levels of VSCs (P < 0.05). Levels of VSCs generated by bacteria were found to be equivalent to, or higher than, that found in commercial cheeses. CONCLUSIONS: Several probiotic strains are able to generate considerable levels of VSCs and substantial variations in VSC generating potential exists between different strains from the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates that probiotic bacteria are able to efficiently generate important flavour and aroma compounds and therefore has implications for the development of probiotic containing foods.
TI  - Characterization of the structural gene encoding nisin F, a new lantibiotic produced by a Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate from freshwater catfish (Clarias gariepinus).
AB  - Lactococcus lactis F10, isolated from freshwater catfish, produces a bacteriocin  (BacF) active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri. The operon encoding BacF is located on a plasmid. Sequencing of the structural gene revealed no homology to other nisin genes. Nisin F is described.
TI  - Coexpression of rumen microbial beta-glucanase and xylanase genes in Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - The aim of this study was to clone and coexpress two rumen fibrolytic enzyme genes in Lactobacillus reuteri. The ability of the genetically modified strain to degrade beta-glucan and xylan was evaluated. The Fibrobacter succinogenes beta-glucanase (1,3-1,4-beta-D: -glucan 4-glucanohydrolase [EC 3.2.1.73]) gene and the Neocallimastix patriciarum xylanase gene, xynCDBFV, were constructed to coexpress and secrete under control of the Lactococcus lactis lacA promoter and its secretion signal and then transformed into L. reuteri Pg4, a strain isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens. The transformed L. reuteri strain acquired the capacity to break down soluble beta-glucan and xylan. The introduction of the recombinant plasmids and production of beta-glucanase and xylanase did not affect cell growth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of coexpression of rumen microbial fibrolytic enzyme genes in L. reuteri.
TI  - Isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  - The transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. To determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more AR genes that encode clinically relevant ARs: tet(M), tet(O), tet(K), erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), aac (6')-Ie aph (2")-Ia, mecA, and blaZ. All of the isolates were initially tested for their AR gene profiles by PCR. The 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaZ gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the MIC, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. Lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by Lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and L. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, L. reuteri, L. crispatus, and L. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. The tet(M) and erm(B) genes were the most frequently detected. Assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(M) plus erm(B) and tet(K) plus erm(B) were the most frequent AR gene patterns. Partial sequencing of the tet(M) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(M) genes previously found in human pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes and Neisseria meningitidis). Southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(M)-carrying plasmids.
TI  - Mucosal immunisation of mice with malaria protein on lactic acid bacterial cell walls.
AB  - Mice were orally and nasally immunised with a malaria parasite protein, MSA2, expressed in Lactococcus lactis, covalently attached to the peptidoglycan (MSA2cP), or non-covalently rebound to L. lactis cell walls, live Lactobacillus reuteri and Lb. salivarius (MSA2cA). Although there was marked variation within mice of the same inbred strain, the data suggest that the characteristics of serum IgG antibodies formed against MSA2 are influenced by the mouse strain and mode of MSA2 presentation. MSA2-specific IgA antibodies in sera and faecal pellets, and IFNgamma-secreting spleen cells were detectable in some immunised animals. MSA2cA on lactobacilli, although not effective in eliciting serum IgG antibodies, showed a potential for eliciting IgA antibodies in the gut. The presence of MSA2 in L. lactis tended to divert the antibody response from lactococcal antigens. The data suggest that anti-MSA2 and anti-lactococcal antibody responses are not necessarily associated in the mice. The findings are related to the use of lactic acid bacteria expressing heterologous proteins for therapy and vaccination.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - There is increasing evidence that Staphylococcus aureus may colonize the intestinal tract, especially among hospitalized patients. As Staph. aureus has been found to be associated with certain gastrointestinal diseases, it has become important to study whether this bacterium can colonize the intestinal tract and if so, whether it is possible to prevent colonization. Adhesion is the first step in colonization; this study shows that Staph. aureus adheres to mucus from resected human intestinal tissue. Certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB), mainly commercial probiotics, were able to reduce adhesion and viability of adherent Staph. aureus. In displacement assays the amount of adherent Staph. aureus in human intestinal mucus was reduced 39-44% by Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. Moreover, adherent Lactobacillus reuteri, Lc. lactis and P. freudenreichii reduced viability of adherent Staph. aureus by 27-36%, depending on the strain, after 2 h incubation. This was probably due to the production of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide and possibly in the case of L. reuteri to the production of reuterin. This study shows for the first time that Staph. aureus can adhere to human intestinal mucus and adherent bacteria can be displaced and killed by certain LAB strains via in situ production of antimicrobial substances.
TI  - Construction and characterization of nisin-controlled expression vectors for use  in Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - The Nisin-controlled gene expression (NICE) system, which was discovered in Lactococcus lactis, was adapted to Lactobacillus reuteri by ligating nisA promoter (PnisA) and nisRK DNA fragments into the Escherichia coli-Lb. reuteri shuttle vector pSTE32. This chimerical plasmid (pNICE) was capable of expressing the heterologous amylase gene (amyL) under nisin induction. Optimization of induction factors for this Lb. reuteri/pNICE system, including nisin concentration (viz. 50 ng/ml), growth phase of culture at which nisin be added (viz. at the early exponential phase), and the best time for analyzing the gene product after inoculation (viz. at the 3rd h), allowed the amylase product to be expressed in high amounts, constituting up to about 18% of the total intracellular protein. Furthermore, the signal peptide (SP) of amyL gene (SPamyL) from Bacillus licheniformis was ligated to the downstream of PnisA in pNICE, upgrading this vector to a NICE-secretion (NIES) level, which was then designated pNIES (Sec+, secretion positive). Characterization of pNIES using an amyL-SPDelta gene (amyL gene lacking its SP) as a reporter revealed the 3rd h after induction as the secretion peak of this system, at which the secretion efficiency and the amount of alpha-amylase being secreted into the culture supernatant were estimated to reach 77.6% and 27.75 mg/l. Expression and secretion of AmyL products by pNIES in Lb. reuteri was also confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis.
TI  - Expression of rumen microbial fibrolytic enzyme genes in probiotic Lactobacillus  reuteri.
AB  - This study was aimed at evaluating the cloning and expression of three rumen microbial fibrolytic enzyme genes in a strain of Lactobacillus reuteri and investigating the probiotic characteristics of these genetically modified lactobacilli. The Neocallimastix patriciarum xylanase gene xynCDBFV, the Fibrobacter succinogenes beta-glucanase (1,3-1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase [EC 3.2.1.73]) gene, and the Piromyces rhizinflata cellulase gene eglA were cloned in a strain of L. reuteri isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of broilers. The enzymes were expressed and secreted under the control of the Lactococcus lactis lacA promoter and its secretion signal. The L. reuteri transformed strains not only acquired the capacity to break down soluble carboxymethyl cellulose, beta-glucan, or xylan but also showed high adhesion efficiency to mucin and mucus and resistance to bile salt and acid.
TI  - Direct cloning of a xylanase gene from the mixed genomic DNA of rumen fungi and its expression in intestinal Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - A relatively newly defined xylanase gene, xynR8, was obtained directly from a mixed DNA sample prepared from unpurified rumen fungal cultures by PCR amplification. The DNA sequence of xynR8 revealed that the gene was 884 bp in size and encoded amino acid sequences with a molecular weight of 27.9 kDa. XynR8 belonged to glycosyl hydrolase family 11, and the catalytic site residues were also found in its amino acid sequence. The main hydrolysis products of XynR8 were xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetrose, which indicated that it belonged to the endoxylanases. The xynR8 gene was constructed so as to express and secrete under the control of the Lactococcus lactis lac A promoter and its secretion signal, and was transformed into L. reuteri Pg4, a strain isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens. The L. reuteri transformants harboring xynR8 not only acquired the capacity to break down xylan, but also maintained their high adhesion efficiency to mucin and mucus and their resistance to bile salts and acid.
TI  - Growth of lactic acid bacteria and Rhizopus oligosporus during barley tempeh fermentation.
AB  - The zygomycete Rhizopus oligosporus is traditionally used to ferment soybean tempeh, but it is also possible to ferment other legumes and cereals to tempeh. The traditional soybean tempeh harbours a multitude of microorganisms with potentially beneficial or detrimental effects on quality. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have positive effects on the safety of soybean tempeh, but the effects of LAB on R. oligosporus growth have not been investigated. We have developed a cereal grain tempeh by fermenting pearled barley with R. oligosporus ATCC 64063. Four LAB species, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactococcus lactis were assessed for their growth abilities and their effects on R. oligosporus growth during barley tempeh fermentation. Growth of LAB was assayed as colony forming units (cfu), while growth of R. oligosporus was measured as ergosterol content and hyphal length. The two fungal measurements highly correlated (r=0.83, P<0.001, n=90). The ergosterol content of fungal mycelia ranged from 11.7 to 30.1 mg/g fungal dry matter. L. plantarum multiplied from 4.8 to 7.4 log cfu/g dry tempeh and L. fermentum increased from 4.4 to 6.8 log cfu/g during 24 h incubation at 35 degrees C. L. reuteri and L. lactis had significantly slower growth, with increases from 4.8 to 5.6 log cfu/g and 5.0 to 5.4 log cfu/g, respectively. The growth of R. oligosporus and the final pH (4.9) in barley tempeh were not significantly influenced by any of the LAB investigated.
TI  - Influence of adjunct cultures on volatile free fatty acids in reduced-fat Edam cheeses.
AB  - The effects of the adjunct cultures Lactococcus lactis ssp. diacetylactis, Brevibacterium linens BL2, Lactobacillus helveticus LH212, and Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 23272 on volatile free fatty acid production in reduced-fat Edam cheese were studied. Lipase activity evaluation using p-nitrophenyl fatty acid ester substrates indicated that L. lactis ssp. diacetylactis showed the highest activity among the 4 adjunct cultures. Full-fat and 33% reduced-fat control cheeses (no adjunct) were made along with 5 treatments of reduced-fat cheeses, which included individual, and a mixture of the adjunct cultures. Volatile free fatty acids of cheeses were analyzed using static headspace analysis with 4-bromofluorobenzene as an internal standard. Changes in volatile free fatty acid concentrations were found in headspace gas of cheeses after 3-and 6-mo ripening. Acetic acid was the most abundant acid detected throughout ripening. Full-fat cheese had the highest relative amount of propionic acid among the cheeses. Certain adjunct cultures had a definite role in lipolysis at particular times. Reduced-fat cheese with L. lactis ssp. diacetylactis at 3-mo showed the highest levels of butyric, isovaleric, n-valeric, iso-caproic, and n-caproic acid. Reduced-fat cheese with Lactobacillus reuteri at 6 mo produced the highest relative concentration of isocaproic, n-caproic, and heptanoic, and the highest relative concentration of total acids.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  - Germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after they were colonized with a pure culture of Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecalis not only induced IBD (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the IL-10 KO mice. Conventional (complex-intestinal flora) IL-10 KO mice developed IBD within 10 to 15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with E. faecalis-induced IBD in gnotobiotic IL-10 KO mice. Conversely, neither germ-free IL-10 mice nor IL-10 KO mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, L. reuteri, L. acidophilus, a Bifidobacterium sp., Lactococcus lactis, or a Bacillus sp. developed IBD during the 25- to 30-week study. E. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger IBD, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.
TI  - Influence of adjunct cultures on ripening of reduced fat Edam cheeses.
AB  - The influence of four adjunct cultures [Brevibacterium linens (BL2), Lactococcus  lactis ssp. diacetylactis, Lactobacillus helveticus (LH212), and Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC 23272)] on chemical and sensory characteristics of reduced fat Edam cheese was studied. The aminopeptidase activity of Lactococcus lactis ssp. diacetylactis was higher than that of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Brevibacterium linens, respectively. Mean percent fat and moisture contents of reduced fat cheese were 20.85 +/- 0.69 and 42.95 +/- 0.43, respectively. Percentage of fat and moisture of full fat control cheese were 30.06 +/- 0.78 and 39.11 +/- 0.60. Titratable acidity increased in all cheese with aging while pH initially decreased but increased in cheese after 6 mo aging at 7 degrees C. Lactic acid bacteria counts were on average one log higher for reduced fat cheeses than for full fat control cheese and counts decreasing with aging. Free amino acids (FAA) in cheeses increased with aging, and were higher in reduced fat cheeses than in the full fat control cheese. Reduced fat cheeses containing L. helveticus exhibited the highest FAA content. Descriptive sensory panelists (n = 9) did not detect differences among cheeses after 3 and 6 mo ripening, but aged/developed flavors (fruity, nutty, brothy, sulfur, free fatty acid) and sweetness increased between 3 and 6 mo. Expert panelists (n = 6) detected differences in texture quality among the cheeses. Reduced fat control cheeses and reduced fat cheeses with L. helveticus and L. reuteri received the highest texture quality scores. Addition of L. helveticus and Lc. lactis ssp. diacetylactis, as adjunct cultures to reduced fat Edam cheeses increased proteolysis, while the addition of L. helveticus and L. reuteri increased texture quality of cheeses.
TI  - Amino acid catabolism in cheese-related bacteria: selection and study of the effects of pH, temperature and NaCl by quadratic response surface methodology.
AB  - AIMS: To screen the cystathionine lyase and L-methionine aminotransferase activities of cheese-related bacteria (lactococci, non-starter lactobacilli and smear bacteria) and to determine the individual and interactive effects of temperature, pH and NaCl concentration on selected enzyme activities. METHODS AND RESULTS: A subcellular fractionation protocol and specific enzyme assays were used, and a quadratic response surface methodology was applied. The majority of the strains, 21 of 33, had detectable cystathionine lyase activity which differed in the specificity. Aminotransferase activity on L-methionine was observed in only three strains. The cystathionine lyase activities of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM20016, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363, Brevibacterium linens 10 and Corynebacterium ammoniagenes 8 and the L-methionine aminotransferase activity of Lact. reuteri DSM20016 had temperature and pH optima of 30-45 degrees C, and 7.5-8.0, respectively. As shown by the quadratic response surface methodology these enzymes retained activities in the range of temperature, pH and NaCl concentration which characterized the cheeses from which the bacteria originated. CONCLUSION: The enzyme activities may have a role in flavour development during cheese ripening. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this work contribute to the knowledge about the amino acid catabolic enzymes in order to improve cheese ripening.
TI  - Molecular analysis of mutated Lactobacillus acidophilus promoter-like sequence P15.
AB  - The promoter-like sequence P15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 is active in Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Escherichia coli, but not in Lactococcus lactis. N-methyl-N-nitroso-N-guanidine (MNNG) mutagenesis of P15 was used to select for a promoter active in L. lactis MG1363. Molecular analysis of the mutated promoter (designated P16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a T-->A transversion. This deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to the consensus promoter sequence found in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. The activity of P16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pBV5030 (designated pLA16). The MIC of chloramphenicol in L. lactis, L. reuteri, L. plantarum, E. coli, and L. acidophilus harbouring pLA16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/mL, respectively. This represents an increase in promoter activity compared to P15 in L. reuteri of 3-fold, in L. plantarum of 9-fold, and in E. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in L. acidophilus of 7-fold.
TI  - Characterization of the bacterial flora of Sudanese sorghum flour and sorghum sourdough.
AB  - The microflora of a Sudanese sorghum flour, a spontaneously fermented sourdough and a long-term sourdough produced in a Sudanese household by consecutive re-inoculations, was studied. The dominant contaminants of sorghum flour were Gram-negative, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria with counts of about 10(5) cfu g-1. The spontaneously fermented sorghum sourdough showed a bacterial succession from Gram-negative, catalase-positive contaminants to Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lact. reuteri. The total bacterial count reached about 10(10) cfu g-1 and the pH dropped from 6.4 to 3.35 in about 42 h. In this phase, only the Latter two species remained dominant in a ratio of 1:1. From the Sudanese long-term dough, seven strains of Lactobacillus were isolated, representing the dominant flora. Sequence comparison of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were used to clarify their phylogenetic positions. Five strains were classified as Lact. vaginalis and could be regarded as heterogeneous biovars of this species. The other two strains could be assigned to Lact. helveticus. RAPD-PCR and sugar fermentation patterns were useful in differentiation of these strains.
TI  - Cloning and molecular analysis of promoter-like sequences isolated from the chromosomal DNA of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356.
AB  - Promoter-like sequences from the chromosomal DNA of thermophilic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 were cloned. Analysis of the three DNA fragments showing promoter activity, designated P3, P6, and P15, were performed in Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactococcus lactis, and E. coli. The reporter cat-86 gene was expressed in all three bacterial species under control of the fragments P3 and P6. Fragment P15 showed promoter activity only in Lactobacillus reuteri and E. coli but not in Lactococcus lactis. The three host-specific transcriptional start points (TSPs) were used when transcription of the cat-86 gene was controlled by fragment P3 in Lactobacillus reuteri, E. coli, and Lactococcus lactis. Similarly, fragment P15 initiated transcription of the cat-86 gene at two distinctive sites in Lactobacillus reuteri and E. coli. Only within fragment P6, a common TSP was used in Lactobacillus reuteri and E. coli, but different from that used in Lactococcus lactis. Each TSP was preceded by the putative -35 and -10 hexamers. Computer analysis of the fragment P3 sequence revealed the existence of divergent promoter-like sequence (P3rev) located on the complementary DNA strand. Fragments P6 and P15 were also functional in Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 from which chromosomal DNA they were originally cloned.
TI  - The formation of biogenic amines by fermentation organisms.
AB  - A total of 523 strains representing 35 species related to food fermentation organisms of practical importance were investigated for their potential for formation of biogenic amines (BA). The investigation was performed with resting cells in phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) and the formation of the following BAs was followed: putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine and 2-phenylethylamine. No potential was observed in species of lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Streptococcus and several Lactobacillus spp., such as L. Pentosus and L. sake. A remarkable potential to form BA was observed in strains of carnobacteria, Lactobacillus buchneri, L. curvatus, L. reuteri, Staphylococcus carnosus and, to a lesser extent, in L. alimentarius, L. brevis, L. bavaricus, L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis, Micrococcus spp. and S. piscifermentans. In well known species with a practical function in the fermentation of dairy products, wine or cabbage a potential was observed for few strains only. In view of their role as starters in food fermentation, or their potential use in protective cultures and as probiotics, BA formation by the organisms has to be taken into consideration by selecting appropriate strains.
TI  - Cloning of promoter-like sequences from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei  CG11 and their expression in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - Fragments of chromosomal DNA from Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei CG11 (formerly Lactobacillus casei CG11) capable of functioning as promoters were isolated using the broad host range, promoter-probe vector pGKV210. Five such fragments designated P61, P79, P80, P116, and P144 were completely sequenced and analyzed. Fragment P61 had the highest transcriptional efficiency in Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus reuteri whereas P80 was the most active in Lactococcus lactis. In general, the orders of the transcriptional strengths were almost identical in E. coli and Lactobacillus reuteri but different from that in Lactococcus lactis. Mapping of the 5' end of cat mRNA showed that different regions of fragments P79 and P144 were used as promoters in Lactococcus lactis than in E. coli and Lactobacillus reuteri. Analysis of these DNA sequences revealed that the putative -35 and -10 hexanucleotides resembled those of E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and lactococci. The spacing between these two hexanucleotides and between the putative -10 hexanucleotide and the transcriptional start point (A residues predominated) ranged from 17 to 18 base pairs and from 5 to 7 base pairs, respectively. Each of the cloned Lactobacillus paracasei CG11 promoter-like fragments contained an AT-rich sequence upstream of the putative -35 region (from 60 to 73%).
TI  - Characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from Benin.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. Lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the Betabacterium group. They include L. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), L. fermentum or L. reuteri (19%), L. brevis (26%), L. confusus (less than 2%), L. curvatus (less than 1%) and L. buchneri (less than 1%). Other isolated lactic acid bacteria were L. salivarius, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by L. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and L. fermentum or L. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. The trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. No strains of L. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.
TI  - Single-stranded DNA plasmid, vector construction and cloning of Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in Lactobacillus.
AB  - Vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to TaqI-digested DNA of a cryptic plasmid from Lactobacillus plantarum. The minimal region of Lactobacillus plasmid DNA that was required for DNA replication was defined and a single-stranded DNA intermediate replication system was observed. Homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from Gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. It was shown that the constructed vectors, named pPSC20 and pPSC22, were transformable into L. plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. Using plasmid pPSC22, the alpha-amylase gene of Bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Conjugal transfer of plasmid pAM beta 1 in Lactobacillus reuteri and between lactobacilli and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The broad-host-range plasmid pAM beta 1 (erythromycin resistance) was transferred conjugally from Streptococcus lactis to Lactobacillus reuteri, L. murinus, and L. fermentum. Transfer of pAM beta 1 between two L. reuteri strains occurred, and lactobacillus transconjugants could act as donors of pAM beta 1 in crosses with Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2.
