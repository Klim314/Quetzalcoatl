TI  == antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial activities of a bodipy-based photosensitizer.
AB  == antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (apdi) employing the bodipy-based photosensitizer 2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-(n-methyl-4-pyridyl)-4,4'-difluoro-boradiazainda cene (dimpy-bodipy) was explored in an in vitro assay against six species of bacteria (eight total strains), three species of yeast, and three viruses as a complementary approach to their current drug-based or non-existent treatments. our best results achieved a noteworthy 5-6 log unit reduction in cfu at 0.1 mum for staphylococcus aureus (atcc-2913), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (atcc-44), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (atcc-2320), a 4-5 log unit reduction for acinetobacter baumannii atcc-19606 (0.25 mum), multidrug resistant  a. baumannii atcc-1605 (0.1 mum), pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc-97 (0.5 mum), and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc-2146 (1 mum), and a 3 log unit reduction for mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 (atcc-700084). a 5 log unit reduction in cfu was observed for candida albicans atcc-90028 (1 mum) and cryptococcus neoformans atcc-64538 (0.5 mum), and a 3 log unit reduction was noted for candida glabrata atcc-15545 (1 mum). infectivity was reduced by 6 log units in dengue 1 (0.1 mum), by 5 log units (0.5 mum) in vesicular stomatitis virus, and by 2 log units (5 mum) in human adenovirus-5. overall, the results demonstrate that dimpy-bodipy exhibits antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal photodynamic inactivation at nanomolar concentrations and short illumination times.

TI  == multidrug-resistant bacterial outbreaks in burn units: a synthesis of the literature according to the orion statement.
AB  == the objective of this study is to review the literature on multidrug-resistant bacteria (mdrb) outbreaks in burn units according to the outbreak reports and intervention studies of nosocomial infection statement. a pubmed search engine was enlisted to identify reports, in english and french, on mdrb outbreaks in burn units, with no date restrictions, using the following key words: ("burn" or  "burns" or "severe burn") and ("unit" or "critical care" or "acute care" or "intensive care" or "center" or "centre" or "department") and ("outbreak" or "epidemic") and ("resistant" or "multidrug-resistant" or "resistance" or "mdr" or "mdro"). twenty-nine articles on such outbreaks in burn units were analyzed. a wide variety of these outbreaks were studied in terms of the microbial agents involved, length of outbreak, and attack rate (1.9-66.7%). the most frequent bacteria were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii. screening of staff revealed carrier rates of 0 to 20% in 16 studies. environmental samples were taken in 21 studies and were positive in 14 of them. the mortality rate among infected patients varied from 0 to 33%. implementation of isolation precautions did not always suffice, with unit closure being necessary in five outbreaks. the lack of consensus on how to manage such outbreak was highlighted. mdrb infections or colonizations are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in vulnerable burn patients. their management is problematic because of multifactorial transmission and limited therapeutic possibilities.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of copper alloys against invasive multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance demanded novel approaches for the prevention of nosocomial infections, and metallic copper surfaces have been suggested as an alternative for the control of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria in surfaces in the hospital environment. this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of copper material for invasive mdr nosocomial pathogens isolated over time, in comparison to stainless steel. clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n:4), oxa-23 and oxa-58 positive, mdr acinetobacter baumannii (n:6) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n:4) were evaluated. the antimicrobial activity of coupons containing 99 % copper and a brass alloy containing 63 % copper was assessed against stainless steel. all the  materials demonstrated statistically significant differences within each other for the logarithmic reduction of microorganisms. among the three materials, the highest reduction of microorganisms was seen in 99 % copper and the least in stainless steel. the result was statistically significant especially for 0, 2, and 4 h (p = 0.05). 99 % copper showed a bactericidal effect at less than 1 h for mrsa and at 2 h for p. aeruginosa. 63 % copper showed a bactericidal effect at 24 h for p. aeruginosa strains only. stainless steel surfaces exhibited a bacteriostatic effect after 6 h for p. aeruginosa strains only. 99 % copper reduced the number of bacteria used significantly, produced a bactericidal effect and was more effective than 63 % copper. the use of metallic copper material could aid in reducing the concentration of bacteria, especially for invasive nosocomial pathogens on hard surfaces in the hospital environment.

TI  == device-associated infection rates and bacterial resistance in six academic teaching hospitals of iran: findings from the international nocosomial infection  control consortium (inicc).
AB  == device-associated health care-acquired infections (da-hais) pose a threat to patient safety, particularly in the intensive care unit (icu). however, few data  regarding da-hai rates and their associated bacterial resistance in icus from iran are available. a da-hai surveillance study was conducted in six adult and pediatric icus in academic teaching hospitals in tehran using cdc/nhsn definitions. we collected prospective data regarding device use, da-hai rates, and lengths of stay from 2584 patients, 16,796 bed-days from one adult icu, and bacterial profiles and bacterial resistance from six icus. among the da-hais, there were 5.84 central line-associated bloodstream infections (clabs) per 1000 central line-days, 7.88 ventilator-associated pneumonias (vaps) per 1000 mechanical ventilator-days and 8.99 catheter-associated urinary tract infections  (cautis) per 1000 urinary catheter-days. the device utilization ratios were 0.44  for central lines, 0.42 for mechanical ventilators and 1.0 for urinary catheters. the device utilization ratios of mechanical ventilators and urinary catheters were higher than those reported in the icus of the inicc and the cdc's nhsn reports, but central line use was lower. the da-hai rates in this study were higher than the cdc's nhsn report. however, compared with the inicc report, the vap rate in our study was lower, while the clab rate was similar and the cauti rate was higher. nearly 83% of the samples showed a mixed-type infection. the most frequent pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. in the s. aureus isolates, 100% were resistant to oxacillin. overall resistances  of a. baumannii and k. pneumonia to imipenem were 70.5% and 76.7%, respectively.  a multiple drug resistance phenotype was detected in 68.15% of the isolates. the  da-hai rates in iran were shown to be higher than the cdc-nhsn rates and similar  to the inicc rates. resistance to oxacillin and imipenem was higher as well. comparing device use, da-hai rates, and bacterial resistance for the primary isolated bacteria indicated a direct association between urinary catheter use and the rates of cauti.

TI  == influence of 4'-o-glycoside constitution and configuration on ribosomal selectivity of paromomycin.
AB  == a series of 20 4'-o-glycosides of the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin were  synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit protein synthesis by bacterial, mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes. target selectivity, i.e., inhibition of the bacterial ribosome over eukaryotic mitochondrial and cytosolic  ribosomes, which is predictive of antibacterial activity with reduced ototoxicity and systemic toxicity, was greater for the equatorial than for the axial pyranosides, and greater for the d-pentopyranosides than for the l-pentopyranosides and d-hexopyranosides. in particular, 4'-o-beta-d-xylopyranosyl paromomycin shows antibacterioribosomal activity comparable to that of paromomycin, but is significantly more selective showing considerably reduced affinity for the cytosolic ribosome and for the a1555g mutant mitochondrial ribosome associated with hypersusceptibility to drug-induced ototoxicity. compound antibacterioribosomal activity correlates with antibacterial activity, and the ribosomally more active compounds show activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa).  the paromomycin glycosides retain activity against clinical strains of mrsa that  are resistant to paromomycin, which is demonstrated to be a consequence of 4'-o-glycosylation blocking the action of 4'-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferases by the use of recombinant e. coli carrying the specific resistance determinant.

TI  == immobilization and orientation-dependent activity of a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide.
AB  == a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide, smap-29, was synthesized with an n-terminal or c-terminal cysteine, termed c_smap and smap_c, respectively, for site-directed immobilization to superparamagnetic beads. immobilized smap orientation-dependent activity was probed against multiple bacteria of clinical interest including acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus anthracis sterne and staphylococcus aureus. a kinetic microplate assay was employed to reveal both concentration and time-dependent activity for elucidation of minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) and sub-lethal effects. immobilized smap activity was equivalent or reduced compared with soluble smap_c and c_smap regardless of immobilization orientation, with only one exception. a comparison of immobilized smap_c and c_smap activity revealed a bacteria-specific potency dependent on immobilization orientation, which was contrary to that seen in solution, wherein smap_c was more potent against all bacteria than c_smap. sub-mbc kinetic studies displayed the influence of peptide exposure to the cells  with multiple bacteria exhibiting increased susceptibility and efficacy at lower  concentrations upon extended exposure (i.e. mbc enhancement). for instances in which complete killing was not achieved, two predominant effects were evident: retardation of growth rate and an increased lag phase. both effects, seen independently and concomitantly, indicate some degree of induced cellular damage  that can serve as a predictor toward eventual cell death. smap_c immobilized on glass through standard silanization chemistry was also investigated to ascertain  the influence of substrate on activity against select bacteria. published 2015. this article is a u.s. government work and is in the public domain in the usa.

TI  == pathogen transfer and high variability in pathogen removal by detergent wipes.
AB  == background: the rise in health care-associated infections has placed a greater emphasis on cleaning and disinfection practices. the majority of policies advocate using detergent-based products for routine cleaning, with detergent wipes increasingly being used; however, there is no information about their ability to remove and subsequently transfer pathogens in practice. methods: seven detergent wipes were tested for their ability to remove and transfer staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and clostridium difficile spores  using the 3-stage wipe protocol. results: the ability of the detergent wipes to remove s aureus, a baumannii, and c difficile spores from a stainless steel surface ranged from 1.50 log10 (range, 0.24-3.25), 3.51 log10 (range, 3.01-3.81), and 0.96 log10 (range, 0.26-1.44), respectively, following a 10-second wiping time. all wipes repeatedly transferred significant amounts of bacteria/spores over 3 consecutive surfaces, although the percentage of total microorganisms transferred from the wipes after wiping was low for a number of products. conclusions: detergent-based wipe products have 2 major drawbacks: their variability in removing microbial bioburden from inanimate surfaces and a propensity to transfer pathogens between surfaces. the use of additional complementary measures such as combined detergent/disinfectant-based products and/or antimicrobial surfaces need to be considered for appropriate infection control and prevention.

TI  == [bloodstream infections in southwestern china: 2012 whire union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  == objective: to test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. methods: blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the whire union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. we performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using whonet5. 5 and spss19.0. results: a total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 gram-positive (50.26%); 868 gram-negative (49.74%). coagulase-negative staphylococcius (cns, 541 strains, 31.00%), escherichia coli (eco, 379 strains, 21.72%), klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and staphylococcus aureus (sau, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of s. aureus and 85.4% of cns, respectively. zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9%  resistance to linezolid, respectively. imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% e. coli, 3.6% klebsiella spp., and 11.1% enterobacter spp.. nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in p.  aeruginosa and 79.1% in acinetobacter baumannii. antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for mrsa and multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections. patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections than others. conclusion: cns, e. coli,klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp. and s. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in southwestern china. low methicillin-resistant rate was found in staphylococcus aureus. but vancomycin-resistant rate was high in e. faecium. imipenem-resistant rates varied in enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in acinetobacter spp. use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.

TI  == development of two real-time multiplex pcr assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these  are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time pcr assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. we found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 cfus/reaction (8333 cfus/ml). furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. the specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in lrti.  concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90%  for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. in conclusion, a quantitative  molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of lrti has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. this should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  == hydroxy tricyclic 1,5-naphthyridinone oxabicyclooctane-linked novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors as broad-spectrum antibacterial agents-sar of rhs moiety (part-3).
AB  == novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (nbtis) are a new class of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents targeting bacterial gyrase a and parc and have potential utility in combating antibiotic resistance. (r)-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridinone left-hand side (lhs) oxabicyclooctane linked pyridoxazinone right-hand side (rhs) containing nbtis showed a potent gram-positive antibacterial profile. sar around the rhs moiety, including substitutions around pyridooxazinone, pyridodioxane, and phenyl propenoids has been described. a fluoro substituted pyridoxazinone showed an mic against staphylococcus aureus of 0.5mug/ml with reduced functional herg activity (ic50 333mum) and good in vivo efficacy [ed90 12mg/kg, intravenous (iv) and 15mg/kg, oral (p.o.)]. a pyridodioxane-containing nbti showed a s. aureus mic of 0.5mug/ml, significantly improved herg ic50 764mum and strong efficacy of 11mg/kg (iv) and 5 mg/kg (p.o.). a phenyl propenoid series of compounds showed potent antibacterial activity, but also showed potent herg binding activity. many of the compounds in the hydroxy-tricyclic series showed strong activity against acinetobacter baumannii, but reduced activity against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bicyclic heterocycles appeared to be the best rhs moiety  for the hydroxy-tricyclic oxabicyclooctane linked nbtis.

TI  == bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been  highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and  complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs and clinical molecules to treat bacterial infections.
AB  == there is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. the objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. a library, containing 727 fda approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobactercloacae). drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. the initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolates. two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against gram-negative pathogens. among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (eb) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (fdurd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable  clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus isolates including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa), and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa).the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of s. aureus were inhibited (mic90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/l  for eb and fdurd, respectively. treatment with eb orally significantly increased  mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic mrsa-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. fdurd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced  mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. these data encourage screening and  repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

TI  == the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia.
AB  == background/aims: although bacteremias due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant (sot), no information in liver transplant recipients is available. we sought to investigate the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia. methodology: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after liver transplantation was reviewed. risk factors for mortality and septic shock caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: forty-nine episodes ofbacteremia in 37 liver transplant recipients were due to eskape strains. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 67.500, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 8.464-538.300, p < .001). the factors for septic shock independently associated with eskape were white blood cells count > 15,000/mm3 (or = 15.205, 95% ci = 2.271-101.799, p = .005) and temperature of 39 degrees c or greater (or = 10.959, 95% ci = 1.592-75.450, p = .015). conclusions: to improve the results of liver transplantation, more effectively therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia present with septic shock, elevated white blood cells count and high body temperature.

TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in hampton roads, virginia.
AB  == we studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the hampton roads area, virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated  with eastern virginia medical school. the data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram- positive and e. coli the  most common gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. overall 53% of s.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. there was a broad scatter of mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and mic of 4 mug/ml was reported in 2012. penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae. vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of enterococcus faecium and 2%  of enterococcus faecalis respectively. acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant gram negative organism in the data compiled. among the escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( sxt) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. we found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == trends in paediatric bloodstream infections at a south african referral hospital.
AB  == background: the epidemiology of paediatric bloodstream infection (bsi) in sub-saharan africa is poorly documented with limited data on hospital-acquired sepsis, impact of hiv infection, bsi trends and antimicrobial resistance. methods: we retrospectively reviewed paediatric bsi (0-14 years) at tygerberg children's hospital between 1 january 2008 and 31 december 2013 (excluding neonatal wards). laboratory and hospital data were used to determine bsi rates, blood culture contamination, pathogen profile, patient demographics, antimicrobial resistance and factors associated with mortality. fluconazole resistant candida species, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing enterobacteriaceae were classified as antimicrobial resistant pathogens. results: of 17001 blood cultures over 6 years, 935 cultures isolated 979 pathogens (5.5% yield; 95% ci 5.3-5.7%). contamination rates were high (6.6%, 95% ci 6.4-6.8%), increasing over time (p = 0.003). discrete bsi episodes were identified (n = 864) with median patient age of 7.5 months, male predominance (57%) and 13% hiv prevalence. bsi rates declined significantly over time (4.6-3.1, overall rate 3.5 per 1000 patient days; 95% ci 3.3-3.7; chi square for  trend p = 0.02). gram negative pathogens predominated (60% vs 33% gram positives  and 7% fungal); klebsiella pneumoniae (154; 17%), staphylococcus aureus (131; 14%) and escherichia coli (97; 11%) were most prevalent. crude bsi mortality was  20% (176/864); hiv infection, fungal, gram negative and hospital-acquired sepsis  were significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. hospital-acquired bsi was common (404/864; 47%). overall antimicrobial resistance rates were high (70% in hospital vs 25% in community-acquired infections; p < 0.0001); hospital-acquired infection, infancy, hiv-infection and gram negative sepsis were associated with resistance. s. pneumoniae bsi declined significantly  over time (58/465 [12.5%] to 33/399 [8.3%]; p =0.04). conclusion: although bsi rates declined over time, children with bsi had high mortality and pathogens exhibited substantial antimicrobial resistance in both community and hospital-acquired infections. blood culture sampling technique and local options  for empiric antimicrobial therapy require re-evaluation.

TI  == multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii in veterinary medicine--emergence of  an underestimated pathogen?
AB  == the proportion of multidrug resistant bacteria causing infections in animals has  continuously been increasing. while the relevance of esbl (extended spectrum beta-lactamase)-producing enterobacteriaceae spp. and mrsa (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus) is unquestionable, knowledge about multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii in veterinary medicine is scarce. this is a worrisome situation, as a. baumannii are isolated from veterinary clinical specimens with rising frequency. the remarkable ability of a. baumannii to develop multidrug resistance and the high risk of transmission are known in human medicine for years. despite this, data regarding a. baumannii isolates of animal origin are missing. due to the changing role of companion animals with closer contact between animal and owner, veterinary intensive care medicine is steadily developing. it can be assumed that the number of "high risk" patients with an enhanced risk for hospital acquired infections will be rising simultaneously. thus, development and spread of multidrug resistant pathogens is envisioned to rise. it is possible, that a. baumannii will evolve into a veterinary nosocomial  pathogen similar to esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and mrsa. the lack of attention paid to a. baumannii in veterinary medicine is even more worrying, as first reports indicate a transmission between humans and animals. essential questions regarding the role of livestock, especially as a potential source of multidrug resistant isolates, remain unanswered. this review summarizes the current knowledge on a. baumannii in veterinary medicine for the first time. it underlines the utmost significance of further investigations of a. baumannii animal isolates, particularly concerning epidemiology and resistance mechanisms.

TI  == kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.

TI  == bioburden increases heterotopic ossification formation in an established rat model.
AB  == background: heterotopic ossification (ho) develops in a majority of combat-related amputations wherein early bacterial colonization has been considered a potential early risk factor. our group has recently developed a small animal model of trauma-induced ho that incorporates many of the multifaceted injury patterns of combat trauma in the absence of bacterial contamination and subsequent wound colonization. questions/purposes: we sought to determine if (1) the presence of bioburden (acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa]) increases the magnitude of ectopic bone formation in traumatized muscle after amputation; and (2) what persistent effects bacterial contamination has on late microbial flora within the amputation site. methods: using a blast-related ho model, we exposed 48 rats to blast overpressure, femur fracture, crush injury, and subsequent immediate transfemoral amputation through the zone of injury. control injured rats (n = 8)  were inoculated beneath the myodesis with phosphate-buffered saline not containing bacteria (vehicle) and treatment rats were inoculated with 1 x 106 colony-forming units of a baumannii (n = 20) or mrsa (n = 20). all animals formed ho. heterotopic ossification was determined by quantitative volumetric measurements of ectopic bone at 12-weeks postinjury using micro-ct and qualitative histomorphometry for assessment of new bone formation in the residual limb. bone marrow and muscle tissue biopsies were collected from the residual limb at 12 weeks to quantitatively measure the bioburden load and to qualitatively determine the species-level identification of the bacterial flora.  results: at 12 weeks, we observed a greater volume of ho in rats infected with mrsa (68.9 +/- 8.6 mm3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 50.52-85.55) when compared  with a baumannii (20.9 +/- 3.7 mm3; 95% ci, 13.61-28.14; p < 0.001) or vehicle (16.3 +/- 3.2 mm3; 95% ci, 10.06-22.47; p < 0.001). soft tissue and marrow from the residual limb of rats inoculated with a baumannii tested negative for a baumannii infection but were positive for other strains of bacteria (1.33 x 102 +/- 0.89 x 102; 95% ci, -0.42 x 102-3.08 x 102 and 1.25 x 106 +/- 0.69 x 106; 95% ci, -0.13 x 106-2.60 x 106 colony-forming units in bone marrow and muscle tissue, respectively), whereas tissue from mrsa-infected rats contained mrsa only (4.84 x 101 +/- 3.22 x 101; 95% ci, -1.47 x 101-11.1 x 101 and 2.80 x 107 +/- 1.73 x 107; 95% ci, -0.60 x 107-6.20 x 107 in bone marrow and muscle tissue, respectively). conclusions: our findings demonstrate that persistent infection with mrsa results in a greater volume of ectopic bone formation, which may be the result of chronic soft tissue inflammation, and that early wound colonization may be a key risk factor. clinical relevance: interventions that mitigate wound contamination and inflammation (such as early debridement, systemic and local antibiotics) may also have a beneficial effect with regard to the mitigation of ho formation and should be evaluated with that potential in mind in future preclinical studies.

TI  == [bacteriological aspects of catheter cultures: study over 24 months].
AB  == background: catheter-related infections are the sixth leading cause of nosocomial infections with approximately 7% of cases. aim: the aim of this work was to establish the bacterial epidemiology of the catheter and tic culture (totally implantable catheter) at the mohamed v military teaching hospital (mvhmi), and to study the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated. methods: this is a retrospective study over 24 months, including the venous and arterial catheters as well as the tic treated at the microbiology laboratory of the mvhmi. the culture was realized by the quantitative brun buisson method. the antibiotic susceptibility was made according to the french society guidelines. results: we have collected 282 cases with 255 catheters and 27 tic. the significant rate culture was 51,42% (n=145) for catheters and tic, including 90,43% catheters and  9,57% tic. these catheters and tic with positive culture emanated primarily from  hemodialysis (32,41%) and surgical intensive care unit (28,97%) services. the microorganisms distribution by species showed the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus (15,91%) followed by acinetobacter baumannii (14,77%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7,39%). the meticilline resistance rate in staphylococcus aureus was  7,14%. the acinetobacter baumannii resistance rate was 64%, and 80,8% for imipenem and ceftazidime respectively. the rate of resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem and ceftazidime was 69.23% for each. conclusion: the bacterial epidemiology of the catheters and tic cultures is dominated by the potentially nosocomial bacteria. multidrug resistance of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa requires an improved catheters management and strengthening nosocomial infections prevention.

TI  == arbekacin activity against contemporary clinical bacteria isolated from patients  hospitalized with pneumonia.
AB  == arbekacin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside licensed for systemic use in japan and under clinical development as an inhalation solution in the united states. we evaluated the occurrence of organisms isolated from pneumonias in u.s. hospitalized patients (php), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap), and the in vitro activity of arbekacin. organism frequency was evaluated from a collection of 2,203 bacterial isolates (339 from vap) consecutively collected from 25 medical centers in 2012 through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. arbekacin activity was tested against 904 isolates from php collected in 2012 from 62 u.s. medical centers and 303 multidrug-resistant (mdr) organisms collected worldwide in 2009 and 2010 from various infection types. susceptibility to arbekacin and comparator agents was evaluated by the reference broth microdilution method. the four most common organisms from php were staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp., and enterobacter spp. the highest arbekacin mic among s. aureus isolates from php (43% methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa]) was 4 mug/ml. among p. aeruginosa isolates from php, only one had an arbekacin mic of >16 mug/ml (mic50 and mic90,  1 and 4 mug/ml), and susceptibility rates for gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin were 88.0, 90.0, and 98.0%, respectively. arbekacin (mic50, 2 mug/ml) and tobramycin (mic50, 4 mug/ml) were the most potent aminoglycosides tested against acinetobacter baumannii. against enterobacteriaceae from php, arbekacin and gentamicin (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 to 1 and 1 to 8 mug/ml for both compounds)  were generally more potent than tobramycin (mic50 and mic90, 0.25 to 2 and 1 to 32 mug/ml) and amikacin (mic50 and mic90, 1 to 2 and 2 to 32 mug/ml). arbekacin also demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a worldwide collection of well-characterized mdr gram-negative and mrsa strains.

TI  == non-aqueous glycerol monolaurate gel exhibits antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == background: skin and surgical infections due to staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii are causes of patient morbidity and increased healthcare costs. these organisms grow planktonically and as biofilms, and many strains exhibit antibiotic resistance. this study examines  the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of glycerol monolaurate (gml), as solubilized in a non-aqueous vehicle (5% gml gel), as a novel, broadly-active topical antimicrobial. the fda has designated gml as generally recognized as safe for human use, and the compound is commonly used in the cosmetic and food industries. methods: in vitro, bacterial strains in broths and biofilms were exposed to gml gel, and effects on bacterial colony-forming units (cfus) were assessed. in vivo,subcutaneous incisions were made in new zealand white rabbits;  the incisions were closed with four sutures. bacterial strains were painted onto  the incision sites, and then gml gel or placebo was liberally applied to cover the sites completely. rabbits were allowed to awaken and were examined for cfus as a function of exposure time. results: in vitro, gml gel was bactericidal for all broth culture and biofilm organisms in <1 hour and <4 hour, respectively; no  cfus were detected after the entire 24 h test period. in vivo, gml gel inhibited  bacterial growth in the surgical incision sites, compared to no growth inhibition in controls. gml gel significantly reduced inflammation, as viewed by lack of redness in and below the incision sites. conclusions: our findings suggest that 5% gml gel is useful as a potent topical antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent for prevention of infections.

TI  == white and blue light induce reduction in susceptibility to minocycline and tigecycline in acinetobacter spp. and other bacteria of clinical importance.
AB  == minocycline (min) and tigecycline (tig) are antibiotics currently used for treatment of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. in this work, we show that blue light, as well as white light, modulates susceptibility to these antibiotics in a temperature-dependent manner. the modulation of susceptibility by light depends on the content of iron; an increase in iron results in a reduction in antibiotic susceptibility both under light and in the dark, though the effect is  more pronounced in the latter condition. we further provide insights into the mechanism by showing that reduction in susceptibility to min and tig induced by light is likely triggered by the generation of (1)o2, which, by a yet unknown mechanism, would ultimately lead to the activation of resistance genes such as those coding for the efflux pump adeabc. the clinical relevance of these results  may lie in surface-exposed wound infections, given the exposure to light in addition to the relatively low temperatures recorded in this type of lesion. we further show that the modulation of antibiotic susceptibility occurs not only in  acinetobacter baumannii but also in other micro-organisms of clinical relevance such as escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. overall, our findings allow us to suggest that min and tig antibiotic treatments may be improved by the inclusion of an iron chelator, in addition to keeping the wounds in the dark, a condition that would increase the effectiveness in the control of infections involving these micro-organisms.

TI  == characterization of a potential beta-lactamase inhibitory metabolite from a marine streptomyces sp. pm49 active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == actinobacteria is a prolific producer of complex natural products; we isolated a  potential marine streptomyces sp. pm49 strain from bay of bengal coastal area of  india. the strain pm49 exhibited highly efficient antibacterial properties on multidrug-resistant pathogens with a zone of inhibition of 14-17 mm. ssf was adopted for the production of the secondary metabolites from pm49 with isp2; utilizing agricultural wastes for compound extraction was also attempted. bioactive fraction of rf value 0.69 resolved using chloroform and ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) was obtained and subjected to further analysis. based on uv, ir, esi-ms, and (1)h and (13)c nmr spectral analysis, it was revealed that the compound is closely similar to cyslabdan with a molecular mass of 467.66 corresponding to the molecular formula c25h41no5s. esbl and mbl production was screened in the hospital test isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. pcr amplification in the phenotypically positive strains was positive for bla imp, bla shv, bla ctx-m, and mec genes. the beta-lactamase enzyme from tested strains had cephalosporinase activity with a 31-kda protein and isolated compound from the strain possessing beta-lactamase inhibitory potential. mic of the active fraction was 16-32 mug/ml  on atcc strains; the ceftazidime and meropenem sensitive and resistant test strains showed mic of 64-256 mug/ml. the streptomyces sp. pm49 aerial mycelium was rectiflexibile; the 16s rrna showed 99 % identity with streptomyces rochei and submitted at genbank with accession no jx904061.1.

TI  == hydrophilic/hydrophobic characters of antimicrobial peptides derived from animals and their effects on multidrug resistant clinical isolates.
AB  == multidrug resistant (mdr) pathogen infections are serious threats to hospitalized patients because of the limited therapeutic options. a novel group of antibiotic  candidates, antimicrobial peptides (amps), have recently shown powerful activities against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. unfortunately,  the viability of using these amps in clinical settings remains to be seen, since  most still need to be evaluated prior to clinical trials and not all of amps are  potent against mdr clinical isolates. to find a connection between the characteristics of several of these amps and their effects against mdr pathogens, we selected 14 amps of animal origin with typical structures and evaluated their  in vitro activities against clinical strains of extensive drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. our results showed that these peptides' hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics, rather than their secondary structures, may explain their antibacterial effects on these clinical isolates. peptides that are amphipathic along the longitudinal direction seemed to be effective against gram-negative pathogens, while peptides with hydrophilic terminals separated by a hydrophobic intermediate section appeared to be effective against both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. among these, cathelicidin-bf was found to inhibit all of the gram-negative pathogens tested at dosages of no more than 16 mg/l, killing a pandrug-resistant a. baumannii strain  within 2 h at 4xmics and 4 h at 2xmics. tachyplesin iii was also found capable of inhibiting all gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens tested at no more than 16 mg/l, and similarly killed the same a. baumannii strain within 4 h at 4xmics and 2xmics. these results suggest that both cathelicidin-bf and tachyplesin iii are likely viable targets for the development of amps for clinical uses.

(2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == chlorine dioxide is a superior disinfectant against multi-drug resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of chlorine dioxide (clo2) compared with sodium hypochlorite (naclo) on various multidrug-resistant strains  in the presence of bovine serum albumin and sheep erythrocytes to mimic the frequent blood contamination in clinical environment. the 3 most important species causing nosocomial infections, i.e., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mdra) were evaluated, with 3 representative strains from each. at a 10 ppm-concentration, clo2 drastically reduced the number of all mdrp and mdra, and 2 out of 3 mrsa strains, but naclo was unable to cause any remarkable attenuation for any of the 9 strains tested in 60 seconds. increased concentration of 100 ppm enabled clo2 to completely kill mrsa strains, whereas naclo failed to significantly lower the number of 2 mrsa and 1 mdra strains. a time-course experiment demonstrated that, within 15 seconds, 100 ppm of clo2 could kill completely all tested strains but naclo at this concentration failed to do so. together, these data suggest that clo2 is more effective than naclo against mrsa, mdrp and mdra, and 100 ppm could be a practical concentration of clo2 against these multidrug-resistant strains, which  may cause fatal nosocomial infections.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia: epidemiology and prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective cohort study in the medical intensive care unit of chaing mai university hospital to describe the epidemiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and identify prognostic indicators of 30-day vap mortality. a total of 621 patients diagnosed with vap between january  2005 and december 2011 were included. the overall 30-day mortality rate was 44.4%. the major causative pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii (54.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.2%), and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (15.1%). most a. baumannii (90.2%) comprised drug-resistant strains. identified prognostic indicators were co-morbid malignancy (hazard ratio [hr] = 1.60; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.02-2.42; p = 0.040), septic shock (hr = 2.51; 95% ci,  1.60-4.00; p < 0.001), simplified acute physiology score ii >45 (hr = 1.62; 95% ci, 1.03-2.56; p = 0.041), sequential organ failure assessment score >5 (hr = 3.40; 95% ci 2.00-5.81; p < 0.001), and delayed inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (hr = 2.23; 95% ci, 1.12-4.45; p = 0.022). vap was associated with high mortality. the major causative pathogen was drug-resistant a. baumannii. therefore, early detection of vap by surveillance in mechanically ventilated patients leading to earlier treatment may improve patient outcomes. guidelines for prescribing appropriate empirical antibiotics to cover drug-resistant bacteria could be established using local epidemiological data.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == introduction: acinetobacter baumannii is a frequent cause of infections in hospitals around the world, which is very difficult to control and treat. it is particularly prevalent in intensive care wards. aim: the main objective of the research was to establish the application of epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections (nis) caused by a. baumannii in order to determine: the type and distribution of nis, and to investigate antimicrobial drug resistance of a. baumannii. material and methods: 855 patients treated at the clinic of anesthesiology and reanimation, university clinical center tuzla during 2013 were followed prospectively for the development of nis. infections caused by a. baumannii were characterized by the anatomical site and antibiotics resistance profile. results: nis were registered in 105 patients (12.3%; 855/105). the predominant cause of infection was a. baumannii with an incidence of 51.4% (54/105), followed by esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae with 15.2% (16/105) of cases, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus with 8.6% (9/105), and esbl-producing proteus mirabilis with 7.6% (8/105). according to the anatomical site, and type of nis caused by a. baumannii, the most frequent were respiratory  infections (74.1%; 40/54). infections of surgical sites were registered in 11.1%  (6/54) of cases, while bloodstream infections in 9.2% (5/54). a. baumannii isolates tested resistant against most antibiotics examined, but showed a high degree of susceptibility to tobramycin (87%; 47/54) and colistin (100%; 54/54). conclusion: the increasing incidence of multi- and extensively drug-resistant acinetobacter spp. emphasizes the importance of administration of an adequate antibiotic strategy and the implementation of strict monitoring of the measures for controlling nosocomial infections.

TI  == efficiency of hydrogen peroxide in improving disinfection of icu rooms.
AB  == introduction: the primary objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) techniques in disinfection of icu rooms contaminated with multidrug-resistant organisms (mdro) after patient discharge. secondary objectives included comparison of the efficiency of a vaporizator (hpv, bioquell) and an aerosolizer using h(2)o(2), and peracetic acid (ahpp, anios) in  mdro environmental disinfection, and assessment of toxicity of these techniques.  methods: this prospective cross-over study was conducted in five medical and surgical icus located in one university hospital, during a 12-week period. routine terminal cleaning was followed by h(2)o(2) disinfection. a total of 24 environmental bacteriological samplings were collected per room, from eight frequently touched surfaces, at three time-points: after patient discharge (t0),  after terminal cleaning (t1) and after h(2)o(2) disinfection (t2). results: in total 182 rooms were studied, including 89 (49%) disinfected with ahpp and 93 (51%) with hpv. at t0, 15/182 (8%) rooms were contaminated with at least 1 mdro (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli 50%, imipenem resistant acinetobacter baumannii 29%, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus 17%, and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime or imipenem 4%).  routine terminal cleaning reduced environmental bacterial load (p <0.001) without efficiency on mdro (15/182 (8%) rooms at t0 versus 11/182 (6%) at t1; p = 0.371). h(2)o(2) technologies were efficient for environmental mdro decontamination (6% of rooms contaminated with mdro at t1 versus 0.5% at t2, p = 0.004). patient characteristics were similar in ahpp and hpv groups. no significant difference was found between ahpp and hpv regarding the rate of rooms contaminated with mdro at t2 (p = 0.313). 42% of room occupants were mdro carriers. the highest rate of  rooms contaminated with mdro was found in rooms where patients stayed for a longer period of time, and where a patient with mdro was hospitalized. the residual concentration of h(2)o(2) appears to be higher using ahpp, compared with hpv. conclusions: h(2)o(2) treatment is efficient in reducing mdro contaminated rooms in the icu. no significant difference was found between ahpp and hpv regarding their disinfection efficiency.

TI  == application of whole-genome sequencing for bacterial strain typing in molecular epidemiology.
AB  == nosocomial infections pose a significant threat to patient health; however, the gold standard laboratory method for determining bacterial relatedness (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [pfge]) remains essentially unchanged 20 years  after its introduction. here, we explored bacterial whole-genome sequencing (wgs) as an alternative approach for molecular strain typing. we compared wgs to pfge for investigating presumptive outbreaks involving three important pathogens: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (n=19), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n=17), and acinetobacter baumannii (n=15). wgs was highly  reproducible (average</=0.39 differences between technical replicates), which enabled a functional, quantitative definition for determining clonality. strain relatedness data determined by pfge and wgs roughly correlated, but the resolution of wgs was superior (p=5.6x10(-8) to 0.016). several discordant results were noted between the methods. a total of 28.9% of isolates which were indistinguishable by pfge were nonclonal by wgs. for a. baumannii, a species known to undergo rapid horizontal gene transfer, 16.2% of isolate pairs considered nonidentical by pfge were clonal by wgs. sequencing whole bacterial genomes with single-nucleotide resolution demonstrates that pfge is prone to false-positive and false-negative results and suggests the need for a new gold standard approach for molecular epidemiological strain typing.

TI  == end group modification: efficient tool for improving activity of antimicrobial peptide analogues towards gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == increased incidence of infections with multidrug-resistant bacterial strains warrants an intensive search for novel potential antimicrobial agents. here, an antimicrobial peptide analogue with a cationic/hydrophobic alternating design displaying only moderate activity against gram-positive pathogens was optimized.  generally, introduction of hydrophobic moieties at the n-terminus resulted in analogues with remarkably increased activity against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. interestingly, the potency against escherichia coli strains was unaffected, whereas modification with hydrophobic moieties led to increased activity towards the gram-negative acinetobacter baumannii. despite increased cytotoxicity against murine fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the optimized peptide analogues exhibited significantly improved cell selectivity. overall, the most favorable hydrophobic activity-inducing moieties were found to be cyclohexylacetyl and pentafluorophenylacetyl groups, while the presence of a short peg-like chain had no significant effect on activity. introduction of cationic moieties conferred no effect or merely a moderate activity-promoting effect to the analogues.

TI  == risk factors for mortality in liver transplant recipients with eskape infection.
AB  == background: although infections caused by the pathogens enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp (eskape) have recently been identified as serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant, no information in liver transplant (lt) recipients is available. we sought to investigate the risk factors for associated mortality in lt recipients with eskape infections. methods: a retrospective analysis of infection after lt was reviewed. risk factors for mortality caused by eskape infection were identified. results: fifty-three episodes of infections caused by eskape were documented in 51 lt recipients. the main sites of infection were the bloodstream (49.0%), the lungs (33.3%), and the intra-abdominal/biliary tract (17.6%). the risk factors for mortality independently associated with eskape infection were female sex (odds ratio [or] = 6.6, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.1-40.8, p = .042), septic shock (or = 30.1, 95% ci = 3.7-244.8, p = .001), and lymphocyte counts <300/mm(3) (or = 20.2, 95% ci = 2.9-142.2, p = .003). conclusions: to improve the results of lt, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when female lt recipients with eskape infection present with septic shock and decreased lymphocyte counts.

TI  == differential impact of infection control strategies on rates of resistant hospital-acquired pathogens in critically ill surgical patients.
AB  == background: there were two major outbreaks of multi-drug resistant acinetobacter  baumannii (mdra) in our general surgery and trauma intensive care units (icus) in 2004 and 2011. both required aggressive multi-faceted interventions to control. we hypothesized that the infection control response may have had a secondary benefit of reducing rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa),  vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), and clostridium difficile (c. diff). methods: we analyzed data retrospectively from a prospective infection control database at a major university hospital and calculated the incidence rates of nosocomial mrsa, vre, and c. diff before and after the two mdra outbreaks (2004 and 2011) in the general surgery and trauma icus, and two unaffected control icus: thoracic surgery icu and medical icu. we tracked incidence rates in 6 mos segments for 24 mos per outbreak and created a composite variable of "any resistant pathogen" for comparison. results: the incidence rates of "any resistant pathogen" were significantly lower in the general surgery icu after both outbreaks (24 to 11 cases per 1000 patient days in 2004, p=0.045 and 7.7 ->4.0 cases per 1000 patient days in 2011, p=0.04). this did not persist after 6  mos. the trauma icu's rate of "any resistant pathogen" did not change after either outbreak (16 ->16.5 cases per 1000 patient days in 2004, p=0.44 and 4.6 ->1.9 cases per 1000 patient days in 2011, p=0.41). the rates in the control icus were unchanged during the study periods. conclusions: rates of resistant pathogens were lower in the general surgery icu after response to mdra outbreaks  in both 2004 and 2011 although the rates increased again with time. there were no changes in rates of resistant pathogens in the trauma icu after mdra outbreaks in 2004 and 2011. outbreak responses may have a differential impact in general surgery icu versus trauma icus.

TI  == trends and correlation of antibacterial usage and bacterial resistance: time series analysis for antibacterial stewardship in a chinese teaching hospital (2009-2013).
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to describe the effect of antibacterial stewardship and evaluate the trends and correlation of antibacterial resistance and usage from 2009 to 2013 in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in northwest china. antibacterial usage was expressed as defined daily doses per 100 patients  per day (ddds/100 pds). hospital-wide population-level data and time series analysis were used to evaluate the trends and determine associations between antibacterial exposure and acquisition of resistance. yearly consumption of overall antibacterials significantly decreased from 66.54 to 28.08 ddds/100 pds (beta = -10.504, p < 0.01). the resistant rates of the five most frequently isolated species (including escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) significantly decreased or remained stable, and none of them showed a statistically significant upward trend. the medical quality indicators got better or remained stable. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models demonstrated that the monthly resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to imipenem was strongly correlated with antipseudomonal carbapenems usage (beta = 34.94, p < 0.001), as did the correlation of p. aeruginosa to meropenem with antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins usage (beta = 32.76, p < 0.01) and k. pneumoniae  to amikacin with aminoglycosides usage (beta = 22.01, p < 0.001). the decreased antibacterial use paralleled the improved bacterial resistance without deteriorating medical quality indicators during antimicrobial stewardship. it also suggests that optimum antibiotic use is necessary to alleviate the threat posed by resistant microorganisms at the hospital level.

TI  == a study on the ability of quaternary ammonium groups attached to a polyurethane foam wound dressing to inhibit bacterial attachment and biofilm formation.
AB  == bacterial infection of acute and chronic wounds impedes wound healing significantly. part of this impediment is the ability of bacterial pathogens to grow in wound dressings. in this study, we examined the effectiveness of a polyurethane (pu) foam wound dressings coated with poly diallyl-dimethylammonium  chloride (pdadmac-pu) to inhibit the growth and biofilm development by three main wound pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii, within the wound dressing. pdadmac-pu inhibited the growth of all three pathogens. time-kill curves were conducted both with and without serum to determine the killing kinetic of pdadmac-pu. pdadmac-pu killed s. aureus, a. baumannii, and p. aeruginosa. the effect of pdadmac-pu on biofilm development was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. quantitative analysis, colony-forming  unit assay, revealed that pdadmac-pu dressing produced more than eight log reduction in biofilm formation by each pathogen. visualization of the biofilms by either confocal laser scanning microscopy or scanning electron microscopy confirmed these findings. in addition, it was found that the pdadmac-pu-treated foam totally inhibited migration of bacteria through the foam for all three bacterial strains. these results suggest that pdadmac-pu is an effective wound dressing that inhibits the growth of wound pathogens both within the wound and in the wound dressing.

TI  == fast and effective photodynamic inactivation of multiresistant bacteria by cationic riboflavin derivatives.
AB  == photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) proves to be an additional method to  kill pathogenic bacteria. pib requires photosensitizer molecules that effectively generate reactive oxygen species like singlet oxygen when exposed to visible light. to allow a broad application in medicine, photosensitizers should be safe  when applied in humans. substances like vitamin b2, which are most likely safe, are known to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. in the present study, we added positive charges to flavin derivatives to enable attachment of these molecules to the negatively charged surface of bacteria. two of the synthesized flavin derivatives showed a high quantum yield of singlet oxygen of approximately 75%. multidrug resistant bacteria like mrsa (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus), ehec (enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii were incubated with these flavin derivatives in vitro and were subsequently irradiated with visible light for seconds only. singlet oxygen  production in bacteria was proved by detecting its luminescence at 1270 nm. after irradiation, the number of viable bacteria decreased up to 6 log10 steps depending on the concentration of the flavin derivatives and the light dosimetry. the bactericidal effect of pib was independent of the bacterial type and the corresponding antibiotic resistance pattern. in contrast, the photosensitizer concentration and light parameters used for bacteria killing did not affect cell  viability of human keratinocytes (therapeutic window). multiresistant bacteria can be safely and effectively killed by a combination of modified vitamin b2 molecules, oxygen and visible light, whereas normal skin cells survive. further work will include these new photosensitizers for topical application to decolonize bacteria from skin and mucosa.

TI  == ecological competition and the incidence of acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in a teaching hospital in southeastern brazil.
AB  == introduction: recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated infections (hais). acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important agents known to cause hais.  it is widespread in healthcare settings and exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. little is known about the impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii infection. methods: we conducted an ecological study, enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (ha-bsis) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in brazil. ha-bsis were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were recovered  from blood cultures collected at least three days after admission. monthly incidence rates were calculated for all ha-bsis (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens). multivariate poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii. results: the overall incidence rate of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was 2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. in the multivariate analysis, the incidence of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was negatively associated with the incidence rates of ha-bsi due to staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio [rr]=0.88; 95% confidence interval [ci]=0.80-0.97), enterobacter spp. (rr=0.84; 95%ci=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: our results suggest that competition between pathogens influences the etiology of ha-bsis. it would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection control policies.

TI  == acinetobacter baumannii universal stress protein a plays a pivotal role in stress response and is essential for pneumonia and sepsis pathogenesis.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most significant threats to global public health. this threat is compounded by the fact that a. baumannii is rapidly becoming resistant to all relevant antimicrobials. identifying key microbial factors through which a. baumannii resists hostile host environment is paramount  to the development of novel antimicrobials targeting infections caused by this emerging pathogen. an attractive target could be a molecule that plays a role in  the pathogenesis and stress response of a. baumannii. accordingly, the universal  stress protein a (uspa) was chosen to be fully investigated in this study. a platform of a. baumannii constructs, expressing various levels of the uspa gene ranging from zero to thirteen folds of wild-type level, and a recombinant e. coli strain, were employed to investigate the role of uspa in vitro stress and in vivo pathogenesis. the uspa protein plays a significant role in protecting a. baumannii from h(2)o(2), low ph, and the respiratory toxin 2,4-dnp. a. baumannii  uspa protein plays an essential role in two of the deadliest types of infection caused by a. baumannii; pneumonia and sepsis. this distinguishes a. baumannii uspa from its closely related homolog, the staphylococcus aureus usp2, as well as from the less similar burkholderia glumae usps. heterologous and overexpression experiments suggest that uspa mediates its role via an indirect mechanism. our study highlights the role of uspa as an important contributor to the a. baumannii stress and virulence machineries, and polishes it as a plausible target for new therapeutics.

TI  == stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins mediate selective broad-spectrum photoinactivation of drug-resistant pathogens at nanomolar concentrations.
AB  == three stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins (bc37, bc38 and bc39) were recently reported to show exceptional activity (low nanomolar) in mediating photodynamic killing of human cancer cells after a 24h incubation upon  excitation with near-infrared light (730 nm). the presence of cationic quaternary ammonium groups in each compound suggested likely activity as antimicrobial photosensitizers. herein this hypothesis was tested against a panel of pathogenic microorganisms that have all recently drawn attention due to increased drug-resistance (gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis; gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii; and fungal yeasts, candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans). all three bacteriochlorins were highly effective against both gram-positive species (>6 logs of eradication at 200 nm and 10 j/cm(2)). the dicationic bacteriochlorin (bc38) was best against the gram-negative species (>6 logs at 1-2 mum) whereas the lipophilic monocationic bacteriochlorin (bc39) was best against the fungi (>6 logs at 1 mum). the bacteriochlorins produced substantial singlet oxygen (and apparently less type-1 reactive-oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical) as judged by activation of fluorescent probes and comparison with 1h-phenalen-1-one-2-sulfonic acid; the order of activity was bc37 > bc38 > bc39.  a short incubation time (30 min) resulted in selectivity for microbial cells over hela human cells. the highly active photodynamic inactivation of microbial cells  may stem from the amphiphilic and cationic features of the bacteriochlorins.

TI  == disease burden of intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia in china: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  == background: intensive care unit (icu)-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) are associated with poor clinical and economic outcomes. data regarding icu-acquired pneumonia and vap are not readily  available from developing countries, including china. the objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the incidence, mortality rate, length of stay, and  pathogens associated with icu-acquired pneumonia in china. methods: a meta-analysis and systematic review of 334 publications published between january 2007 and may 2012 and retrieved from the chinese biomedical database, china national knowledge infrastructure, vip chinese science and technique journals database, wanfang database, and pubmed was conducted. results: the incidences of  icu-acquired pneumonia and vap were 16.2% (95% confidence interval (ci) 12.8-20.4%) and 33.7% (95% ci 31.4-36.1%), respectively; mortality rates were 37.4% (95% ci 24.6-52.2%) and 34.5% (95% ci 29.2-40.1%), respectively. the durations of stay in the icu and hospital were 12.4 (95% ci 9.6-15.3) and 17.7 (95% ci 15.6-19.7) days and 18.0 (95% ci 16.5-19.6) and 30.5 (95% ci 26.4-34.7) days for icu-acquired pneumonia and vap, respectively. pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.9%) and acinetobacter baumannii (13.9%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (11.9%) and staphylococcus aureus (10.4%); 82.9% of s. aureus isolates were reported to be methicillin-resistant. conclusions: icu-acquired pneumonia/vap remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients in the icu in china. data on organisms causing disease in this population could help guide appropriate prevention strategies and treatment.

TI  == anti-cancer, immunoregulatory, and antimicrobial activities of the frog skin host-defense peptides pseudhymenochirin-1pb and pseudhymenochirin-2pa.
AB  == pseudhymenochirin-1pb (ps-1pb) and pseudhymenochirin-2pa (ps-2pa) are host-defense peptides, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog pseudhymenochirus merlini (pipidae). ps-1pb and ps-2pa are highly cytotoxic (lc50<12 mum) against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma mda-mb-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma ht-29 cells but are also hemolytic against human erythrocytes (lc50=28+/-2 mum for ps-1pb and lc50=6+/-1 mum for ps-2pa). ps-2pa shows selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells (lc50 against non-neoplastic human umbilical vein (huvec) cells=68+/-2 mum). ps-1pb and ps-2pa (5 mug/ml) significantly inhibit production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 and the multifunctional cytokine il-6 from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from c57bl/6 mice and  enhance the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-23 from both unstimulated and lps-stimulated macrophages. ps-1pb potently (mic</=10 mum) inhibits growth of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of the gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, and the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. ps-2pa shows the same high potency (mic</=10 mum) against the gram-positive bacteria but is 2-4 fold less potent against the gram-negative isolates. ps-1pb at 4xmic kills 99.9% of escherichia coli within 30 min and 99.9% of s. aureus within 180 min. in conclusion, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest that the ps-1pb and ps-2pa represent templates for design of non-hemolytic analogs for tumor therapy and for treatment of infections in cancer patients produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  == wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. however, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. for this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis)  were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. by applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; mycobacterium bolletii, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium botulinum. the genus treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified  at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. using specific real-time pcr on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria bartonella spp. borrelia spp., coxiella burnetii and tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. we estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.

TI  == intracranial malignant lesions correlate with the requirement for a long treatment course in postoperative central nervous system infection.
AB  == aim: our aim was to study the clinical features of postoperative meningitis after neurosurgery and identify the factors affecting the duration of treatment. methods: this retrospective study assessed 283 patients with postoperative bacterial meningitis in the neurosurgery department of beijing tiantan hospital,  beijing, people's republic of china, between january and december 2012. patients' clinical data were reviewed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with a prolonged treatment course. results: the mortality rate was 0.4% in these patients, of whom 12.4% were found  with pathogens in the cerebrospinal fluid. among the three most common pathogens  detected were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean treatment course was 13.5+/-2.1 days. interestingly, the treatment duration for postoperative meningitis was significantly longer in patients with intracranial malignant tumors than in those with benign lesions. single-factor analysis showed that male sex (p=0.042) and malignant (rather than benign) lesions (p<0.001) were significantly associated with prolonged treatment duration. multivariate analysis further confirmed that malignant intracranial lesions represented an independent risk factor for prolonged treatment duration (odds ratio: 2.5962; 95% confidence interval: 1.1092-6.6134). conclusion: the nature of the intracranial lesion is an independent risk factor for the duration of treatment in postoperative meningitis after neurosurgery.

TI  == differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections between general wards and ricu.
AB  == background: lower respiratory tract infections (lrtis) are common among patients  in hospitals worldwide, especially in patients over the age of 60. this study investigates the differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lrtis. methods: the clinical and laboratory data of 4,762 lrti patients in the general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (ricu) of xiangya hospital (changsha) were retrospectively analyzed. results: the infection rate of gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of gram-positive bacteria in both the general ward and ricu (p<0.05). the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection was significantly higher in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05), whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection  is less in the ricu than in the general ward (p<0.05). in the general ward, the incidence of gram-negative bacteria infection significantly increased (p<0.05) over time, whereas the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection significantly decreased from 1996 to 2011 (p<0.05). in the ricu, the incidence of gram-positive bacteria infection decreased, while gram-negative bacteria infections increased without statistical significance (p>0.05). staphylococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were found to be the predominant gram-positive strains in the general ward (34.70-41.18%) and ricu (41.66-54.87%), respectively (p>0.05). pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant gram negative strains in the general ward (19.17-21.09%) and ricu (29.60-33.88%), respectively (p>0.05). streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics with a sensitivity of more than 70%. staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (100%), chloramphenicol (74.36-82.19%), doxycycline (69.57-77.33%), and sulfamethoprim (67.83-72.46%); however, its sensitivity to other antibiotics is low and decreased each year. sensitivity of pseudomonas aeruginosa to most beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone group antibiotics decreased each year. conclusions: the distribution and drug sensitivity of lrti pathogens exhibit a high divergence between the general ward and ricu. streptococcus pneumoniae may not be the predominant pathogen in lrtis in some areas of china.

TI  == etiological factors causing lower respiratory tract infections isolated from hospitalized patients.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infections (lrti) account for 20-30 % of all hospital-acquired contagions. they are characterized by high mortality of hospitalized patients. the most serious form of lrti is pneumonia, and the most common etiological factors in such cases are bacteria. the article gives the analysis of bacterial flora samples obtained from lower respiratory tract of hospitalized patients. in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to selected antibiotics has also been assessed. we carried out a retrospective analysis of 1,171 bacterial strains isolated from 1,171 patients treated in clinics of the military institute of medicine in warsaw, poland. in most cases the samples were  collected from an endotracheal or tracheostomic tube (71.5 %) and from bronchoalveolar lavage (21.7 %). the most commonly isolated pathogens included acinetobacter baumannii (35.8 %), staphylococcus aureus (27.6 %), klebsiella pneumoniae (19.4 %), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.2 %). multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria exhibited 100 % susceptibility to colistin only. klebsiella pneumoniae esbl+ and acinetobacter baumannii were most susceptible to  carbapenems, while pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to ceftazidime. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were 100 % susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline. in conclusion, identifying the etiological factors causing infections of the lower respiratory tract and determining their drug-susceptibility is of key importance in empirical treatment.

TI  == one-step species-specific high resolution melting analysis for nosocomial bacteria detection.
AB  == nosocomial infections are a major public health concern worldwide. early and accurate identification of nosocomial pathogens which are often multidrug resistant is crucial for prompt treatment. hence, an alternative real-time polymerase chain reaction coupled with high resolution melting-curve analysis (hrma) was developed for identification of five nosocomial bacteria. this assay targets species-specific regions of each nosocomial bacteria and produced five distinct melt curves with each representing a particular bacterial species. the melting curves were characterized by peaks of 78.8 +/- 0.2 degrees c for acinetobacter baumannii, 82.7 +/- 0.2 degrees c for escherichia coli, 86.3 +/- 0.3 degrees c for klebsiella pneumoniae, 88.8 +/- 0.2 degrees c for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 74.6 +/- 02 degrees c for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the assay was able to specifically detect the five bacterial species with an overall detection limit of 2 x 10(-2) ng/mul. in conclusion, the hrm assay developed is a simple and rapid method for identification of the selected nosocomial pathogens.

AB  == arbekacin sulfate (abk), an aminoglycoside antibiotic, was discovered in 1972 and was derived from dibekacin to stabilize many common aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. abk shows broad antimicrobial activities against not only gram-positive  bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) but also gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. abk has been approved as an injectable formulation in japan since 1990, under the trade name habekacin, for the treatment of patients with pneumonia and sepsis caused by mrsa. the drug has been used in more than 250,000 patients, and its clinical benefit and safety have been proven over two decades. abk currently shows promise for the application for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections such as multidrug-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii because  of its synergistic effect in combination with beta-lactams.

TI  == evaluation of the effectiveness of an infection control program in adult intensive care units: a report from a middle-income country.
AB  == background: the rates of hand hygiene improvement and health care-associated infections (hais) were evaluated after the introduction in 2004 of an infection surveillance and prevention program at a university teaching hospital in a low- to middle-income country. methods: data on hand hygiene compliance, hai rate, multiresistant organisms, and antibiotic consumption in 4 adult intensive care units (icus; medical, general surgery, anesthesiology and reanimation, and neurosurgery) were collected retrospectively for each year from 2004 to 2012. negative binomial regression modeling with a log link was used to adjust for overdispersion in observations, and the first year of observations served as the  baseline for comparing changes in incidence rate ratio (irr) over the subsequent  years. results: total hand hygiene compliance improved from 30.5% in 2004 to 43.5% by 2010 (irr, 1.3; p <.0001) and reached 63.8% by 2012 (irr, 1.9; p < .0001). the hai rate was 42.6/1,000 patient-days at baseline and increased significantly thereafter until 2012, when it decreased by 20% to 33.6/1,000 patient-days (irr, 0.8; p = .001). the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was 7.85 (95% confidence interval [ci], 5.89-10.26)/1,000 catheter-days in 2004 and increased to 12.4 (95% ci, 9.98-14.39)/1,000 catheter-days in 2012 (irr, 1.5; p = .024). the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia remained stable from the 2004 baseline rate of 31.66/1,000 ventilator-days to the 2012 rate of 24.04/ 1,000 ventilator-days (irr, 0.88; p =  .574). the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection remained relatively stable between 2004 and 2012 (from 7.92/1,000 catheter-days to 4.97/1,000 catheter-days; p = .101). the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection was 6.24/1,000 patient-days at baseline and decreased significantly to 0.73/1,000 patient-days by 2007 (irr, 0.13; p <.001) and continued to remain below 2/1,000 patient-days for the next 5 years. the rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection decreased significantly from 8.66/1,000 patient-days in 2004 to 6.09/1,000 patient-days in 2010 (irr, 0.72; p = .026) and to 5.44/1,000 patient-days by 2012 (irr, 0.63; p = .002). the rate of acinetobacter baumannii infection was 14.3/1,000 patient-days at baseline, decreased significantly by 2005 (irr, 0.73; p = .012), fluctuated between 2006 and 2010, and then decreased significantly to 10.44/1,000 patient-days in 2011 (irr, 0.74; p = .007) and then to 7.6/1,000 patient-days in 2012 (irr, 0.53; p <  .001). antibiotic consumption did not decrease noticeably over the 9-year study period. conclusions: hand hygiene improved in all of the icus evaluated. measuring changes in hai rates in a single health care setting can be statistically challenging, and a bias in the detection rates is not uncommon in the early years of a new infection prevention program. here, for the first time,  implementation of an infection surveillance and prevention program was associated with a reduction in hai rate.

TI  == acinetobacter baumannii neonatal mastitis: a case report.
AB  == introduction: neonatal mastitis is a rare infection. when it does occur, infants  younger than 2 months of age are typically affected and the majority of cases are caused by staphylococcus aureus. we present the first reported case of neonatal mastitis caused by acinetobacter baumannii, an unusual organism for this type of  infection. case presentation: a 15-day-old full-term caucasian male neonate presented to our emergency room following fever at home and was admitted for routine neonatal sepsis evaluation. after admission, he developed purulent drainage from his right nipple, was diagnosed with mastitis, and was started on empiric therapy with clindamycin and cefotaxime with presumed coverage for s. aureus. drainage culture identified pan-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii/haemolyticus and antibiotic therapy was changed to ceftazidime. he was  discharged after 5 days of ceftazidime with complete resolution of his symptoms.  conclusions: this case illustrates the importance of obtaining drainage cultures  in mastitis cases because of the possibility of organisms besides s. aureus causing infection. acinetobacter baumannii is considered part of the normal human flora and is associated with serious infections in intensive care units. this is  the first case report describing acinetobacter baumannii as an etiologic agent of neonatal mastitis and highlights the importance of including unusual organisms in the differential for infectious etiologies for general practitioners.

TI  == conformational analysis and cytotoxic activities of the frog skin host-defense peptide, hymenochirin-1pa.
AB  == hymenochirin-1pa (lklspktkdtlkkvlkgaikgaiaiasma-nh2) is a host-defense peptide first isolated from skin secretions of the frog pseudhymenochirus merlini (pipidae). a nuclear magnetic resonance structural investigation demonstrates that the peptide has a random coil conformation in water but, in the membrane-mimetic solvent 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol-water adopts a well-defined conformation characterized by two alpha-helical domains from residues k6 to g17 and from g21 to m28, with the n-terminal region unfolded. the presence of a gxxxg domain, the most common structural motif found at the interface between interacting trans-membrane helices, between residues 17 and 21, introduces a kink corresponding to a deviation from linearity of 93 +/- 31 degrees . hymenochirin-1pa shows broad spectrum anti-bacterial activity, including high potency against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. the peptide also shows high cytotoxic potency against human non-small lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma mda-mb-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma ht-29 cells but its therapeutic potential as an anti-cancer agent is limited by moderate hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and lack of selectivity for tumor cells. increasing cationicity of the peptide by substituting the asp(9) residue by either l-lys (k) or d-lys (k) has relatively minor effects on antimicrobial and anti-tumor potencies but the [d9k] analog is non-hemolytic lc50 > 400 mum. thus, [d9k]hymenochirin-1pa may serve as a template for the design of non-toxic antimicrobial agents for use against multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of wq-3810, a novel fluoroquinolone, against multidrug-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the in vitro antibacterial activity of wq-3810, a new fluoroquinolone, against clinically relevant pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) and fluoroquinolone-resistant (fqr) isolates, compared  with those of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. wq-3810 demonstrated the most potent activity against the antimicrobial-resistant pathogens tested. against a. baumannii, including mdr isolates, the potency of wq-3810 [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=1 mg/l] was more than eight-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin (64 mg/l) and levofloxacin (8 mg/l). against e. coli and s. pneumoniae, including fqr isolates, wq-3810 (mic(90)=4 mg/l and 0.06 mg/l, respectively) was also more active than ciprofloxacin (64 mg/l and 2 mg/l) and levofloxacin (32 mg/l and 2 mg/l). furthermore, wq-3810 was the most potent among the fluoroquinolones tested against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including fqr isolates. in particular, wq-3810 demonstrated highly potent activity against fqr isolates of a. baumannii, e. coli and s. pneumoniae with amino acid mutation(s) in the quinolone resistance-determining region of dna gyrase and/or topoisomerase iv, which are the target enzymes of fluoroquinolones. an enzyme inhibition study performed using fqr e. coli dna gyrase suggested that  the potent antibacterial activity of wq-3810 against drug-resistant isolates partly results from the strong inhibition of the target enzymes. in conclusion, this study demonstrated that wq-3810 exhibits extremely potent antibacterial activity over the existing fluoroquinolones, particularly against mdr and fqr pathogens.

TI  == risks for multidrug-resistant pathogens in the icu.
AB  == purpose of review: the impact of multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) is rising  and often underestimated. the epidemiology of mdros is extremely complex and multifactorial. there is increasing antibiotic resistance, mainly related to antibiotic pressure and patients' characteristics. recent findings: emphasis on mdro epidemiology is needed to better understand current strategies of prevention and management. among them, antibiotic stewardship has been one of the most successful strategies. it is important to note that there is a controversial issue when considering community and healthcare-related infections. in addition,  different strategies have been determined to find the impact and optimal use of recently launched antibiotics for mdro treatment. summary: infections with mdros  can prolong hospital stay, promote antibiotic use and prolong duration of mechanical ventilation. some points should be further explored in clinical research such as the heterogeneity of healthcare-associated pneumonia and the need of new drug development. resistance to non fermentative gram-negative bacilli, rising minimum inhibitory concentration in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and spread of mdros in patients without known risk factors  suggest a review of guideline validation, taking into account ecology and severity of patient illness to provide timely and appropriate empiric therapy.

TI  == preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  == the ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. a recombinantly produced cdh from myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mm or 2 mm cellobiose as substrate. biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by cdh when supplemented with 1mm cellobiose. the cdh/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, cdh was also able to produce h(2)o(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exps) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. the h(2)o(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exps were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for cdh as well as destabilises the biofilm. furthermore, cdh suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. incorporation of the cdh/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore  makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.

TI  == antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of biosurfactants isolated from lactobacilli against multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == background: biosurfactants (bs) are amphiphilic compounds produced by microbes, either on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly. bs exhibit strong antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties, making them good candidates for applications used to combat infections. in this study, our goal was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities of bs produced by lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus rhamnosus against clinical multidrug  resistant (mdr) strains of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). cell-bound bs from both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus were extracted and isolated. the surface activities of crude bs samples were evaluated using an oil spreading assay. the antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities of both bs against the above mentioned mdr pathogens were determined. results: surface activities for both bs ranged from 6.25 to 25 mg/ml  with clear zones observed between 7 and 11 cm. bs of both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus showed antimicrobial activities against a. baumannii, e. coli and s. aureus at 25-50 mg/ml. anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities were also observed for the aforementioned pathogens between 25 and 50 mg/ml. finally, analysis by electron microscope indicated that the bs caused membrane damage for  a. baumannii and pronounced cell wall damage in s. aureus. conclusion: our results indicate that bs isolated from two lactobacilli strains has antibacterial properties against mdr strains of a. baumannii, e. coli and mrsa. both bs also displayed anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities against a. baumannii, e. coli  and s. aureus. together, these capabilities may open up possibilities for bs as an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention and/or treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

AB  == background: although bacteremias caused by the 6 eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted  as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (sot), more information is urgently needed. we sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of  eskape bacteremia in sot and determine the risk factors for mortality. methods: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after sot was reviewed. risk factors for mortality caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by eskape strains. of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant eskape (reskape) organisms. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 5.038-87.682, p < 0.001). the factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with reskape bacteremia were septic shock (or = 16.558, 95% ci = 6.620-104.668, p = 0.003) and age >/=40 years (or = 7.521, 95% ci = 1.196-47.292, p = 0.031). conclusions: to improve the outcomes of transplantation, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when older sot recipients with bacteremia due to eskape/reskape organisms present with septic shock.

TI  == preventing the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms: modeling the relative importance of hand hygiene and environmental cleaning interventions.
AB  == objective: hand hygiene and environmental cleaning are essential infection prevention strategies, but the relative impact of each is unknown. this information is important in assessing resource allocation. methods: we developed  an agent-based model of patient-to-patient transmission-via the hands of transiently colonized healthcare workers and incompletely terminally cleaned rooms-in a 20-patient intensive care unit. nurses and physicians were modeled and had distinct hand hygiene compliance levels on entry and exit to patient rooms. we simulated the transmission of acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci for 1 year using data from the literature and observed data to inform model input parameters. results:  we simulated 175 parameter-based scenarios and compared the effects of hand hygiene and environmental cleaning on rates of multidrug-resistant organism acquisition. for all organisms, increases in hand hygiene compliance outperformed equal increases in thoroughness of terminal cleaning. from baseline, a 2ratio1 improvement in terminal cleaning compared with hand hygiene was required to match an equal reduction in acquisition rates (eg, a 20% improvement in terminal cleaning was required to match the reduction in acquisition due to a 10% improvement in hand hygiene compliance). conclusions: hand hygiene should remain  a priority for infection control programs, but environmental cleaning can have significant benefit for hospitals or individual hospital units that have either high hand hygiene compliance levels or low terminal cleaning thoroughness.

TI  == highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an iraqi burn care unit.
AB  == objective: in low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. we describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in iraq. methods: we performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between july 2008 and september 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in iraq who developed sepsis. results: in 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% ci 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. the most commonly isolated organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). a high proportion of enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and s. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. for gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. conclusions: burn patients with sepsis in iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class  antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.

TI  == factors influencing ventilator-associated pneumonia in cancer patients.
AB  == background: with increasing survival periods and diversification of treatment methods, treatment of critically ill cancer patients has become an important factor influencing patient prognosis. patients with cancer are at high risk of infections and subsequent complications. this study investigated the incidence and factors contributing to the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). materials and methods: this retrospective study investigated the incidence of vap and factors leading to infection in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (icu) of a cancer center from january 1, 2012 to december 31, 2013. results: the incidence of vap was 2.13 cases per 1,000 days of intubation, and 13 of 288 patients (4.5%) developed vap. lung cancer was the most common cancer associated with vap (n=7, 53.9%), and longer hospital stays and intubation were associated with increased vap incidence. in the group using a "ventilator bundle," the incidence was 1.14 cases per 1,000 days compared to 2.89 cases per 1,000 days without its use; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.158). age (>/= 65, or=5.56, 95% confidence interval [ci]=1.29-23.95), surgery (or=3.78, 95%ci=1.05- 13.78), and tracheotomy (or=4.46, 95%ci=1.00-19.85) were significant vap risk factors. the most common causative organisms were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=4, 30.8% each), followed by acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans (n=2, 15.4% each). conclusions: the incidence of pneumonia among critically ill cancer patients is highest in those with lung cancer, but lower than among non-cancer patients. the length of hospital stay and time on mechanical ventilation are important risk factors for development of vap. although not statistically significant, "ventilator bundle" care is an effective  intervention that delays or reduces incidence of vap. major risk factors for vap  include age (>/= 65 years), surgery, and tracheostomy, while fungi, gram-negative bacteria, and multidrug-resistant organisms were identified as the major causative pathogens of vap in this study.

TI  == recombinant scorpine produced using sumo fusion partner in escherichia coli has the activities against clinically isolated bacteria and inhibits the plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in vitro.
AB  == scorpine, a small cationic peptide from the venom of pandinus imperator, which has been shown to have anti-bacterial and anti-plasmodial activities, has potential important applications in the pharmaceutical industries. however, the isolation of scorpine from natural sources is inefficient and time-consuming. here, we first report the expression and purification of recombinant scorpine in  escherichia coli, using small ubiquitin-related modifier (sumo) fusion partner. the fusion protein was expressed in soluble form in e. coli, and expression was verified by sds-page and western blotting analysis. the fusion protein was purified to 90% purity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (ni2+-nta) resin chromatography. after the sumo-scorpine fusion protein was cleaved by the sumo protease, the cleaved sample was reapplied to a ni2+-nta column. tricine/sds-page gel results indicated that scorpine had been purified successfully to more than 95% purity. the recombinantly expressed scorpine showed anti-bacterial activity against two standard bacteria including staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and acinetobacter baumannii atcc 19606, and clinically isolated bacteria including s. aureus s, s. aureus r, a. baumannii s, and a. baumannii r. it also produced 100%  reduction in plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in vitro. thus, the expression strategy presented in this study allowed convenient high yield and easy purification of recombinant scorpine for pharmaceutical applications in the future.

TI  == [a prospective randomized controlled trial on effect of norvancomycin tube sealing for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection in critical patients].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the clinical value of tube-sealing with norvancomycin and  heparin saline mixture for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection (cri). methods: a prospective randomized controlled trial was performed. 120 patients who were admitted to department of critical care medicine from january 2012 to january 2014 were included, with their subclavian vein catheterization installation time longer than 48 hours, age over 18 years and younger than 80 years, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii (apache ii) score reaching 10-29. the patients were divided into two groups using a random number table, and finally 116 patients were enrolled. norvancomycin and  heparin saline mixture were used for tube sealing in the intervention group (n=56), while only heparin saline was used in the control group (n=60). the incidence of cri, catheter correlated spectrum of pathogens, adverse events, mortality, hospital day, catheter retention time, and hospital costs were compared between two groups. results: (1) there was no significant difference in  the incidence of cri between intervention group and control group [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, p=1.000]. there was no catheter pathogenic colonization in the intervention group, but there were 2 cases of catheter pathogenic colonization in control group. (2) a total of 7 pathogens were found in two groups. three cases with pathogenic bacteria was found in the intervention group, with 1 case of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 case acinetobacter baumannii, and 1 case fungi. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, fungi, and acinetobacter baumannii was found in the control group, with 1 case of each. there was no significantly statistical difference between two groups (all p>0.05), but there was a decreasing trend of gram-positive cocci infection in the intervention group. (3) there was no significant difference in the catheter thrombosis, local bleeding or hematoma, catheter dislocation and other adverse events between intervention group and control group [21.43% (12/56) vs. 23.33% (14/60), chi(2)=0.060, p=0.806]. (4) there were no significant differences in mortality [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, p=1.000], hospital day (35.9+/-15.2 days vs. 34.1+/-16.3 days, t=16.330, p=0.620), catheter retention time (25.0+/-4.5 days vs. 24.5+/-5.1 days, t=26.427, p=2.560) and cost of hospitalization (10 thousand yuan: 3.42+/-1.22 vs. 3.72+/-1.30, t=13.215, p=1.560) between intervention group and control group. conclusions: for patients  with central venous catheter, application norvancomycin with heparin saline mixture for tube sealing did not reduce the incidence of cri, the incidence of adverse events and mortality, does not reduce hospitalization time, catheter retention time and hospital costs, but may reduce the catheter colonization and infection of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == impact of appropriate antimicrobial treatment on transition from ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis to ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == introduction: two small randomized controlled trials have suggested beneficial effects of antibiotic treatment in patients with ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (vat). the primary aim of this study is to determine the impact of appropriate antibiotic treatment on transition from vat to ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) in critically ill patients. the secondary objective was to determine the incidence of vap in patients with vat. methods: this was a prospective observational multicenter study. all patients with a first episode of vat were eligible. patients with tracheostomy at intensive care unit (icu) admission, and those with vap prior to vat were excluded. vat was defined using all the following criteria: fever > 38 degrees c with no other cause, purulent tracheal secretions, positive tracheal aspirate (>/= 10(5) cfu/ml), and  absence of new infiltrate on chest x ray. only vap episodes diagnosed during the  96 h following vat, and caused by the same bacteria, were taken into account. antibiotic treatment was at the discretion of attending physicians. risk factors  for transition from vat to vap were determined using univariate and multivariate  analysis. all variables from univariate analysis with p values <0.1 were incorporated in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. results: one thousand seven hundred and ten patients were screened for this study. eighty-six, and 123 patients were excluded for tracheostomy at icu admission, and vap prior to vat; respectively. one hundred and twenty two (7.1%) patients were included. 17 (13.9%) patients developed a subsequent vap. the most common microorganisms in vat patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%), staphylococcus aureus (18%), and  acinetobacter baumannii (10%). seventy-four (60%) patients received antimicrobial treatment, including 58 (47.5%) patients who received appropriate antimicrobial treatment. appropriate antibiotic treatment was the only factor independently associated with reduced risk for transition from vat to vap (or [95% ci] 0.12[0.02-0.59], p = 0.009). the number of patients with vat needed to treat to prevent one episode of vap, or one episode of vap related to p. aeruginosa was 5, and 34; respectively. conclusions: appropriate antibiotic treatment is independently associated with reduced risk for transition from vat to vap.

TI  == polyethyleneimine and polyethyleneimine-based nanoparticles: novel bacterial and  yeast biofilm inhibitors.
AB  == biofilms are commonly involved in medical device-related infections. the purpose  of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of polyethyleneimine (pei) and pei-based nanoparticles (nanopei) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans (clinical and atcc strains), and to evaluate their effect upon biofilm formation on polyurethane (pur)-like catheters. mics and minimal lethal concentrations of pei and nanopei were determined according to clsi microdilution reference protocols. for pei, the mic value was 195.31 mg l(-1) for all the bacteria and 48.83 mg l(-1) for the yeast strains. for nanopei, the mic value was 1250 mg l(-1) for all the strains except a. baumannii, for which it was 2500 mg l(-1). biofilm formation was assessed with pur-like catheter segments and biofilm metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. plasma membrane integrity and membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry after staining microbial cells with a membrane-impermeable dye, propidium iodide, and a membrane-potential marker, dibac4(3). pei inhibited growth of all microbial species; higher concentrations of nanopei were needed to  inhibit growth of all species. biofilm formation in the presence of anti-bacterial pei activity was dose-dependent (except for s. epidermidis) and species-related. nanopei at 0.5xmic and mic significantly reduced the metabolic activity of biofilms of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii, whereas 2xmic was required in order to inhibit biofilm metabolic activity.

TI  == differential protection from tobramycin by extracellular polymeric substances from acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus biofilms.
AB  == we investigated biofilms of two pathogens, acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus, to characterize mechanisms by which the extracellular polymeric substance (eps) found in biofilms can protect bacteria against tobramycin exposure. to do so, it is critical to study eps-antibiotic interactions in a homogeneous environment without mass transfer limitations. consequently, we developed a method to grow biofilms, harvest eps, and then augment planktonic cultures with isolated eps and tobramycin. we demonstrated that planktonic cultures respond differently to being treated with different types of eps (a. baumannii versus s. aureus) in the presence of tobramycin. by harvesting eps from the biofilms, we found that a. baumannii eps acts as a "universal protector" by inhibiting tobramycin activity against bacterial cells regardless of species; s. aureus eps did not show any protective ability in cell  cultures. adding mg(2+) or ca(2+) reduced the protective effect of a. baumannii eps. finally, when we selectively digested the proteins or dna of the eps, we found that the protective ability did not change, suggesting that neither has a significant role in protection. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates how eps protects pathogens against antibiotics in a homogeneous system without mass transfer limitations. our results suggest that eps protects biofilm communities, in part, by adsorbing antibiotics near the surface. this may limit antibiotic diffusion to the bottom of the biofilms but is not likely to be the only mechanism of protection.

AB  == more information regarding the bactericidal properties of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (phmg) against clinically important antibiotic-resistant  eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens needs to be provided for its uses in infection control. the bactericidal properties of phmg and chlorhexidine digluconate (chg) were compared based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), minimum bactericidal concentrations, and time-course-killing curves against clinically important antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant eskape pathogens. results showed  that phmg exhibited significantly higher bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter spp. than chg. a slight bactericidal advantage over chg was obtained against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, ciprofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant acinetobacter spp., and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. in previous reports, phmg had higher antimicrobial activity against almost all tested gram-negative bacteria and several gram-positive bacteria than chg using mic test. these studies support the further development of covalently bound phmg in sterile-surface materials and the incorporation of phmg in novel disinfectant formulas.

TI  == prevalence of nosocomial infections and anti-infective therapy in benin: results  of the first nationwide survey in 2012.
AB  == background: data on nosocomial infections in hospitals in low-income countries are scarce and often inconsistent. the objectives of this study were to estimate  the prevalence of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial drug use in benin hospitals. methods: all hospitals were invited to participate in the first national point prevalence study conducted between 10-26 october 2012 using the protocol developed by the "hospitals in europe link for infection control through surveillance" (helics) project. infection prevalence rates and the proportion of  infected patients and exposure to antimicrobials were assessed. results: overall, 87% (39/45) of hospitals participated. of 3130 inpatients surveyed, 972 nosocomial infections were identified among 597 patients, representing an overall prevalence of infected patients of 19.1%. the most frequent infections were related to the urinary tract (48.2%), vascular catheter use (34.7%), and surgical site (24.7%). 64.6% of patients surveyed were treated with antibiotics, including a significant proportion (30%) of non-infected patients and a high proportion of  self-medication (40.8%). resistance of leading nosocomial pathogens to antimicrobials included methicillin-resistance (52.5%) among staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistance among enterococci (67.5%), cefotaxime resistance among escherichia coli (67.6%), and ceftazidime resistance among acinetobacter baumannii (100%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (68.2%). conclusions: benin has high  nosocomial infection rates and calls for the implementation of new national infection control policies. patient safety education and training of all individuals involved in healthcare delivery will be critical to highlight awareness of the burden of disease. the high use of antimicrobials needs to be addressed, particularly their indiscriminate use in non-infected patients.

TI  == in vitro design of a novel lytic bacteriophage cocktail with therapeutic potential against organisms causing diabetic foot infections.
AB  == in patients with diabetes mellitus, foot infections pose a significant risk. these are complex infections commonly caused by staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, all of which are potentially  susceptible to bacteriophages. here, we characterized five bacteriophages that we had determined previously to have antimicrobial and wound-healing potential in chronic s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii infections. morphological and genetic features indicated that the bacteriophages were lytic members of the family myoviridae or podoviridae and did not harbour any known bacterial virulence genes. combinations of the bacteriophages had broad host ranges for the different target bacterial species. the activity of the bacteriophages against planktonic cells revealed effective, early killing at 4 h, followed by bacterial  regrowth to pre-treatment levels by 24 h. using metabolic activity as a measure of cell viability within established biofilms, we found significant cell impairment following bacteriophage exposure. repeated treatment every 4 h caused  a further decrease in cell activity. the greatest effects on both planktonic and  biofilm cells occurred at a bacteriophage : bacterium input multiplicity of 10. these studies on both planktonic cells and established biofilms allowed us to better evaluate the effects of a high input multiplicity and a multiple-dose treatment protocol, and the findings support further clinical development of bacteriophage therapy.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == broad-spectrum anti-biofilm peptide that targets a cellular stress response.
AB  == bacteria form multicellular communities known as biofilms that cause two thirds of all infections and demonstrate a 10 to 1000 fold increase in adaptive resistance to conventional antibiotics. currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically target bacterial biofilms. here we identified a potent anti-biofilm peptide 1018 that worked by blocking (p)ppgpp, an important signal in biofilm development. at concentrations that did not affect planktonic growth,  peptide treatment completely prevented biofilm formation and led to the eradication of mature biofilms in representative strains of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium and burkholderia cenocepacia. low levels of the peptide led to biofilm dispersal, while higher doses triggered biofilm cell death. we hypothesized that the peptide acted to inhibit a common stress response in target species, and that the stringent response, mediating (p)ppgpp synthesis through the enzymes rela and spot, was targeted. consistent with this, increasing (p)ppgpp synthesis by addition of serine hydroxamate or over-expression of rela led to reduced susceptibility to the peptide. furthermore, rela and spot mutations blocking production of (p)ppgpp replicated the effects of the peptide, leading to a reduction of biofilm formation in the four tested target species. also, eliminating (p)ppgpp expression after two days of biofilm growth by removal of arabinose from a strain expressing rela behind an arabinose-inducible promoter, reciprocated the effect of peptide added at the same time, leading to loss of biofilm. nmr and chromatography studies showed that the peptide acted on cells to cause degradation of (p)ppgpp within 30 minutes, and in vitro directly interacted with  ppgpp. we thus propose that 1018 targets (p)ppgpp and marks it for degradation in cells. targeting (p)ppgpp represents a new approach against biofilm-related drug  resistance.

TI  == antibacterial activity of tham trisphenylguanide against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == this study investigated the potential antibacterial activity of three series of compounds synthesized from 12 linear and branched polyamines with 2-8 amino groups, which were substituted to produce the corresponding guanides, biguanides, or phenylguanides, against acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. antibacterial activity was measured for each compound by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration against the bacteria, and the toxicity towards mammalian cells was  determined. the most effective compound, tham trisphenylguanide, was studied in time-to-kill and cytoplasmic leakage assays against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, usa300) in comparison to chlorhexidine. preliminary  toxicity and mrsa challenge studies in mice were also conducted on this compound. tham trisphenylguanide showed significant antibacterial activity (mic approximately 1 mg/l) and selectivity against mrsa relative to all the other bacteria examined. in time-to-kill assays it showed increased antimicrobial activity against mrsa versus chlorhexidine. it induced leakage of cytoplasmic content at concentrations that did not reduce cell viability, suggesting the mechanism of action may involve membrane disruption. using an intraperitoneal mouse model of invasive mrsa disease, tham trisphenylguanide reduced bacterial burden locally and in deeper tissues. this study has identified a novel guanide compound with selective microbicidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, including a methicillin-resistant (mrsa) strain.

TI  == potent antimicrobial activity of bone cement encapsulating silver nanoparticles capped with oleic acid.
AB  == bone cement is widely used in surgical treatments for the fixation for orthopaedic devices. subsequently, 2-3% of patients undergoing these procedures develop infections that are both a major health risk for patients and a cost for  the health service providers; this is also aggravated by the fact that antibiotics are losing efficacy because of the rising resistance of microorganisms to these substances. in this study, oleic acid capped silver nanoparticles (np) were encapsulated into poly(methyl methacrylate) (pmma)-based  bone cement samples at various ratios. antimicrobial activity against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, acinetobacter baumannii was exhibited at np concentrations as low as 0.05% (w/w). furthermore, the mechanical properties and cytotoxicity of the bone cement containing these np were assessed to guarantee that such material is safe to be used in orthopaedic surgical practice.

TI  == paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  == paenibacterin, produced by paenibacillus thiaminolyticus osy-se, is active both against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (atcc crl-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50)>/=109mug/ml. the cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. in a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of p. aeruginosa. considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that  this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.

TI  == eliciting antibiotics active against the eskape pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils.
AB  == the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. in recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the himalaya and qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against mdr pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes  were identified - predominantly streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the mdr clinical isolates referred to as eskape pathogens: enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or enterobacter cloacae. antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not  described previously. our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that  have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific  pathogen.

TI  == clinical significance of surveillance culture in liver transplant recipients.
AB  == background: routine microbiologic surveillance is a method of infection control,  but its clinical significance in transplant recipients is not known. we analyzed  microbiologic data to evaluate the influence of cultured microorganisms between the point of surveillance and infectious episodes in liver transplant recipients. methods: we performed surveillance culture for sputum and peritoneal fluid in liver transplant recipients from january 2009 to december 2011, at the time of transplantation (t1), 5 days (t2), and 10 days (t3) postoperatively. results: of  the 179 recipients, 32.9% had a positive sputum culture result and 37.4% had a positive peritoneal culture result during surveillance. in the culture surveillance of sputum, 37 organisms were isolated from 35 recipients at t1, and  the most common organism was staphylococcus aureus (n = 13). at t2, 45 organisms  were isolated from 39 recipients, including klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), s aureus (n = 8), and acinetobacter baumannii (n = 6). at t3, 18 organisms were isolated from 15 patients, including stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5) and k pneumonia (n = 4). in the peritoneal fluid, 11 organisms were isolated from 10 recipients at t1, including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2) and enterococcus species (n = 2). at t2, 39 organisms were isolated from 36 recipients, including  coagulase-negative staphylococcus species (cns; n = 8) and enterococcus species (n = 7). at t3, 54 organisms were isolated from 51 recipients, including cns (n = 17) and candida species (n = 8). among the 59 patients with positive culture results for sputum surveillance, 16.9% developed pneumonia caused by the same organisms. among the 67 patients with positive peritoneal fluid culture, 16.4% developed an intra-abdominal infection caused by the same organisms cultured. the recipients with positive surveillance culture had a higher risk of pneumonia (20.3% [12/59] vs 1.6% [2/120]; p < .001) and intra-abdominal infection (31.3% [21/67] vs 18.7% [21/112]; p = .05). conclusions: periodic microbiologic surveillance may be useful in the prediction of post-transplantation pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection and could offer a potential target for empirical antimicrobial therapy in cases of infection.

TI  == control of multi-drug-resistant pathogens with non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing.
AB  == background: non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma (non-thermal plasma)  is being investigated for use in wound healing. alginate gel, already in clinical use, is non-toxic but has no meaningful antimicrobial property. this study reports that a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing has strong antimicrobial properties. methods: alginate gel was treated with non-thermal plasma in room air and inoculated with bacterial pathogens. at 15 min after this, bacterial cell viability was determined by colony assay or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-  nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (xtt) assay. the anti-biofilm efficacy of the non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel was investigated and the  treated gel was tested against vascular endothelial cells for a cytotoxic effect. the proliferation and migration of bacterial cells before and after exposure to the treated gel were investigated with an in vitro wound testing assay. scanning  electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the gel surface associated with exposure to bacterial pathogens. the treated gel was tested against acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, candida albicans, and c. glabrata as representative pathogens (at 10(6)-10(9) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml), and the thickness of a plasma-treated gel dressing and distance between a glass dielectric-barrier discharge plasma probe and the gel surface were kept constant. results: non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel exhibited a strong biocidal property and inactivated all of the pathogens included in the study at counts of 10(8) cfu/ml and within 15 sec of treatment. the treated gel inactivated 10(9) cfu/ml of the organisms within 1 min, and 3 min of exposure to the treated gel inactivated pathogens embedded in biofilms. the plasma-treated gel showed no significant cytotoxicity, and endothelial cells exposed to the treated gel proliferated and migrated well across a wound area over a period of time. dressings made with the treated gel retained their biocidal effects for about a month. scanning electron microscopy showed no damage to the surfaces of treated gels, but damage to the bacterial pathogens on plasma exposure. conclusion: a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel dressing has the clinical potential to decontaminate wounds, prevent surgical site infection, and promote wound healing.

TI  == micro-patterned surfaces reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro: potential for enhancing endotracheal tube designs.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a leading hospital acquired  infection in intensive care units despite improved patient care practices and advancements in endotracheal tube (ett) designs. the ett provides a conduit for bacterial access to the lower respiratory tract and a substratum for biofilm formation, both of which lead to vap. a novel microscopic ordered surface topography, the sharklet micro-pattern, has been shown to decrease surface attachment of numerous microorganisms, and may provide an alternative strategy for vap prevention if included on the surface of an ett. to evaluate the feasibility of this micro-pattern for this application, the microbial range of performance was investigated in addition to biofilm studies with and without a mucin-rich medium to simulate the tracheal environment in vitro. methods: the top five pathogens associated with ett-related pneumonia, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, acinetobacter baumannii, and escherichia coli, were evaluated for attachment to micro-patterned and un-patterned silicone surfaces in a short-term colonization assay. two key pathogens, mrsa and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were evaluated for biofilm formation in a nutrient rich broth for four days and minimal media for 24 hours, respectively, on each surface type. p. aeruginosa was further evaluated for biofilm formation on each surface type in a mucin-modified medium mimicking tracheal mucosal secretions. results are reported as percent reductions and significance is based on t-tests and anova models of log reductions. all experiments were replicated at least three times. results: micro-patterned surfaces demonstrated reductions in microbial colonization for a broad range of species, with up to 99.9% (p < 0.05) reduction compared to un-patterned controls. biofilm formation was also reduced, with 67% (p = 0.12) and 52% (p = 0.05) reductions in mrsa and p. aeruginosa biofilm formation, respectively. further, a  58% (p < 0.01) reduction was demonstrated on micro-patterned surfaces for p. aeruginosa biofilms under clinically-simulated conditions when compared to un-patterned controls. conclusions: this engineered micro-pattern reduces the colonization and biofilm formation of key vap-associated pathogens in vitro. future application of this micro-pattern on endotracheal tubes may prevent or prolong the onset of vap without the need for antimicrobial agents.

TI  == identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria in patients with suspected  sepsis by multiplex pcr.
AB  == introduction: staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus spp., enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter  baumanii have been found to be the most prevalent bacteremia-causing bacteria in  patients with septicemia. early detection of bloodstream infection (bsi) is crucial in the clinical setting. a multiplex pcr method for identification of these agents in clinical samples has been developed in parallel by conventional microbiological methods. methodology: the target genes selected for each of the organisms were very specific for designing primers. design of primers was done using mega4, allel id6, oligo6, and oligo analyzer software. the test comprises a universal pcr from the 16s rdna gene and multiplex pcr from the rpob, gyra, sss,  and chromosome x (as an internal control). results: the sensitivity and specificity for universal pcr and multiplex pcr in comparison with bc were 83.87% and 91.58%, and 74.19% and 91.58%, respectively. the positive predictive value (ppv) and the negative predictive value (npv) for these two pcrs were 76.47% and  94.57%, and 74.19% and 91.58%, respectively. pcr failed to identify bacteria which were found conventionally in only 3.96% and 6.34% of the cases by universal and multiplex pcr (mostly bacteria not included in the pcr cassette). in 6.34% of the cases, multiplex pcr afforded identification of bacteria, but bc showed no bacteria in the sample. conclusions: the multiplex pcr approach facilitates the detection of bacteremia in blood samples within a few hours. rapid detection of bacteria by multiplex pcr appears to be a valuable tool, allowing earlier pathogen-adopted antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients.

TI  == nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia in a community hospital intensive  care unit: a retrospective review and analysis.
AB  == background: nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) are causes of significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. we analyzed a) the  incidence and the outcome of pneumonias caused by different pathogens in the intensive care unit (icu) of a medium-sized twenty-four bed community hospital and b) the incidence of complications of such pneumonias requiring surgical intervention such as thoracotomy and decortication. results: we retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients diagnosed with nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia in our icu. their bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) and sputum cultures, antibiograms, and other clinical characteristics, including  complications and need for tracheostomy, thoracotomy and decortication were studied. in a span of one year (2011-12), 43 patients were diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia in our icu. the median simplified acute physiology score (saps ii) was 39. one or more gram negative organisms as the causative agents were present in 85% of microbiologic samples. the three most prevalent gram negatives were stenotrophomonas maltophilia (34%), pseudomonas aeurginosa (40%),  and acinetobacter baumannii (32%). twenty eight percent of bronchoalveolar samples contained staphylococcus aureus. eight three percent of patients required mechanical ventilation postoperatively and 37% underwent tracheostony. thirty five percent underwent thoracotomy and decortication because of further complications such as empyema and non-resolving parapneumonic effusions. a. baumannii, klebsiella pneumonia extended spectrum beta lactam (esbl) and p. aeurginosa had the highest prevalence of multi drug resistance (mdr). fifteen patients required surgical intervention. mortality from pneumonia was 37% and from surgery was 2%. conclusion: nosocomial pneumonias, in particular the ones that were caused by gram negative drug resistant organisms and their ensuing complications which required thoracotomy and decortication, were the cause of significant morbidity in our intensive care unit. preventative and more intensive and novel infection control interventions in reducing the incidence of nosocomial pneumonias are strongly emphasized.

AB  == objective: to study the distribution characteristics of pathogens, the drug resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), and the use of antibiotics against gram negative bacilli (gnb) in burn wards, so as to provide a guide for future treatment. methods: a total of 2 758 strains of pathogens were isolated from specimens of wound excretion, venous catheter attachment, blood, stool, urine, and sputum from 7 441 patients hospitalized in our burn wards from january 2007 to december 2012. after being identified by api strips and automatic microorganism identification and drug sensitivity analyzer, drug resistance of all the pathogens to 13 antibiotics commonly used in clinic, including amikacin,  cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, etc., was tested by k-b paper disk diffusion method. the defined daily doses per 1 000 patient-day of 5 antibiotics including  amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin each year was set as use intensity. the whonet 5.6 software was used to analyze the distribution of pathogens and the drug resistance of pa to 13 antibiotics. the spss 19.0 software was used to analyze the relation between changes in drug-resistant rates of pa to 13 antibiotics and year, the relation between the proportion of pa in all the pathogens and the use intensity of 5 antibiotics commonly used against gnb, and the relation between the use intensity of ciprofloxacin and the change in drug-resistant rates of pa to amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and imipenem with pearson correlation analysis. results:  (1) in 6 years, staphylococcus aureus ranked the first with the highest proportion (31%, 865/2 758). the proportion of pa increased to tie in with acinetobacter baumannii (both accounting for 17%, 458/2 758), both taking the second place. (2) drug-resistant rates of pa to amikacin, gentamicin, aztreonam,  piperacillin, cefoperazone, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem, and meropenem were significantly increased and  positively correlated with year (with r values from 0.844 to 0.988, p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), while the drug-resistant rate of pa to ciprofloxacin was decreased and negatively correlated with year (r = -0.836, p < 0.05). (3) in 6 years, the use intensity of amikacin (from 8.65 to 91.44), cefoperazone/sulbactam (from 9.62 to  63.56), imipenem (from 7.63 to 157.25), ceftazidime (from 18.39 to 86.11), and ciprofloxacin (from 0 to 19.77) was increased. (4) the proportion of pa in all the pathogens was positively correlated with the use intensity of imipenem and ciprofloxacin (with r values respectively 0.849, 0.933, p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), while it was not significantly correlated with the use intensity of amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, or ceftazidime (with r values respectively 0.672, 0.668,  0.794, p values all above 0.05). (5) the use intensity of ciprofloxacin was positively correlated with the drug-resistant rates of pa to amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and imipenem (with r values respectively 0.878, 0.934, 0.928, p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). conclusions: in our burn wards, drug-resistant pa was prevalent, with positive correlation with the use intensity of antibiotics. the sensitive rate can be increased by a decrease in the use of amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and imipenem periodically.

AB  == background: the incidence rate of infection by multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) can affect the accuracy of etiological diagnosis when using american thoracic society (ats) guidelines. we determined the accuracy of the ats guidelines in predicting infection or colonization by mdros over 18 months at a single icu in eastern china. methods: this prospective observational study examined consecutive patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit (icu) in nanjing, china. mdros were defined as bacteria that were resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii. screening for mdros was performed at icu admission and discharge. risk factors for infection or colonization with mdros were recorded, and the accuracy of the ats guidelines in predicting infection or colonization with mdros was documented. results: there were 610 patients, 225 (37%) of whom were colonized or infected with mdros at icu admission, and this increased to 311 (51%) at discharge. at admission, the sensitivity (70.0%), specificity (31.6%), positive predictive value (38.2%), and negative predictive value (63.5%), all based on ats guidelines for infection or colonization with mdros were low. the negative predictive value was greater in patients from departments with mdro infection rates of 31-40% than in patients from departments with mdro infection rates of 30% or less and from departments with mdro infection rates more than 40%. conclusion: ats criteria were not reliable in predicting infection or colonization with mdros in our icu. the negative predictive value was greater in  patients from departments with intermediate rates of mdro infection than in patients from departments with low or high rates of mdro infection. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct01667991.

TI  == next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
AB  == loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. such wounds then become chronically infected. topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of next science wound gel technology (nxtsc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. in vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that nxtsc inhibited biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. the gel formulation nxtsc-g5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 cfu/disc or cfu/g. in vivo, nxtsc-g5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. storage of nxtsc-g5 at  room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. these results establish that nxtsc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection  and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. this novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life,  shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.

TI  == inhibition of rnd-type efflux pumps confers the ftsz-directed prodrug txy436 with activity against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == infections caused by gram-negative bacterial pathogens are often difficult to treat, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains further restricting clinical treatment options. as a result, there is an acute need for the development of new therapeutic agents active against gram-negative bacteria. the  bacterial protein ftsz has recently been demonstrated to be a viable antibacterial target for treating infections caused by the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus in mouse model systems. here, we investigate whether an ftsz-directed prodrug (txy436) that is effective against s. aureus can also target gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli. we find that the conversion product of txy436 (pc190723) can bind e. coli ftsz and inhibit its polymerization/bundling in vitro. however, pc190723 is intrinsically inactive against wild-type e. coli, with this inactivity being derived from the actions of the efflux pump acrab. mutations in e. coli acrab render the mutant bacteria susceptible to txy436. we further show that chemical inhibition of acrab in e. coli, as well as its homologs in klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii, confers all three gram-negative pathogens with susceptibility to txy436. we demonstrate that the activity of txy436 against e. coli and k. pneumoniae is bactericidal in nature. evidence for ftsz-targeting and inhibition  of cell division in gram-negative bacteria by txy436 is provided by the induction of a characteristic filamentous morphology when the efflux pump has been inhibited as well as by the lack of functional z-rings upon txy436 treatment.

TI  == prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community-associated bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance is increasing in many community settings. the purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant community-associated bloodstream infections (ca-bsis) present on hospital admissions to identify risk factors for acquiring resistant versus susceptible ca-bsis and to describe the incidence of concurrent infections with ca-bsis. methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from one community, one pediatric, and two tertiary/quaternary care hospitals within an academically affiliated network in the borough of manhattan in new york, ny, from 2006 to 2008. the ca-bsis present at hospital admission were defined as bsis occurring within the first 48h of hospitalization. infections and patient characteristics were identified using data available from patients' electronic medical records and discharge records. results: in total, 1677 ca-bsis were identified. staphylococcus aureus had the largest proportion of resistance (41.2%), followed by enterococcal species (24.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%), streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%), acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9%). significant predictors of resistance were prior residence in a skilled nursing facility (or, 2.55; 95% ci, 1.39-4.70), advanced age (1.01; 1.002-1.02), presence of malignancy (0.58; 0.37-0.91), prior hospitalization (1.62; 1.17-2.23), a weighted charlson score (1.09; 1.02-1.17) for s. aureus, presence of malignancy (1.82; 1.004-3.30), prior hospitalizations  (2.03; 1.12-3.38) for enterococcal species, and younger age for s. pneumoniae (p=0.02). urinary tract infections were the most common concurrent infection (n=45/87, 51.7%). conclusion: over 27% of the ca-bsis present on admission were antibiotic resistant. understanding the prevalence and risk factors for ca-bsis may help improve empiric antibiotic therapy and outcomes for patients with community-onset infections.

TI  == bacteriological study of neonatal sepsis and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of isolates in kathmandu, nepal.
AB  == bloodstream infections in neonates are life-threatening emergencies. identification of the common bacteria causing such infections and their susceptibility patterns will provide necessary information for timely intervention. this study was done to determine the prevalence of neonatal septicaemia, identify the bacterial isolates and study their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of nepal medical college teaching hospital (nmcth), kathmandu, nepal. this descriptive-analytical study was conducted in nmcth from july 2011 to january 2012. blood culture of all neonates who were suspected for neonatal sepsis was performed. bacterial isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done by standard microbiological method. out of 120 neonates suspected of having neonatal sepsis, 30.8% (37/120) were blood culture positive (i.e. prevalence = 30.8%). the most common causative agents of neonatal sepsis was staphylococcus aureus (56.8%; 21/37) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (21.7%; 8/37), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.4%; 5/37) and others. neonatal sepsis was more frequent in male neonates (32.5%) while (26.5%) in female neonates in the ratio of 1.2:1 (p > 0.05). neonatal sepsis was significantly higher (58.3%) in low birth weight (lbw) (< 2.5kg) neonates compared with good birth weight (gbw) (23.9%) (< 0.05). prevalence was higher in preterm neonates (57.8%; 11/19)  as compared with term-babies (25.7%) (p = 0.05). generally, all of the isolates were sensitive to most of the antibiotics used as the first line drugs like amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and ampicillin except acinetobacter baumannii. this organisms was only sensitive towards cotrimoxazole, azithromicin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime.

TI  == evaluation of the effects of ultraviolet light on bacterial contaminants inoculated into whole milk and colostrum, and on colostrum immunoglobulin g.
AB  == raw milk and colostrum can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious  health risks for animals and humans. according to the usda, more than 58% of calves in the united states are fed unpasteurized milk. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of uv light on reduction of bacteria in milk and colostrum, and on colostrum igg. a pilot-scale uv light continuous (uvc) flow-through unit (45 j/cm(2)) was used to treat milk and colostrum. colostrum and sterile whole milk were inoculated with listeria innocua, mycobacterium smegmatis, salmonella serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and acinetobacter baumannii before being treated with uvc. during uvc treatment, samples were collected at 5 time points and bacteria were enumerated using selective media. the effect of uvc on igg was  evaluated using raw colostrum from a nearby dairy farm without the addition of bacteria. for each colostrum batch, samples were collected at several different time points and igg was measured using elisa. the uvc treatment of milk resulted  in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction of listeria monocytogenes (3.2 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (3.7 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), escherichia coli (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), staph. aureus (3.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), streptococcus spp. (3.4 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml reduction), and a. baumannii (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of milk did not result in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction for m. smegmatis (1.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment  of colostrum was significantly associated with a final reduction of bacterial count (log cfu/ml) of listeria spp. (1.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (1.0 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and acinetobacter spp. (1.1 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), but not of e. coli (0.5 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), strep. agalactiae (0.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and staph. aureus (0.4 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of colostrum significantly decreased the igg concentration, with an observed final mean igg reduction of approximately 50%. development of new methods to reduce bacterial contaminants in colostrum must take into consideration the barriers imposed by its opacity and organic components, and account for the incidental damage to igg  caused by manipulating colostrum.

TI  == contamination of medical charts: an important source of potential infection in hospitals.
AB  == objective: this prospective study aims to identify and compare the incidence of bacterial contamination of hospital charts and the distribution of species responsible for chart contamination in different units of a tertiary hospital. methods: all beds in medical, surgical, pediatric, and obstetric-gynecologic general wards (556) and those in corresponding special units (125) including medical, surgical, pediatric intensive care units (icus), the obstetric tocolytic unit and delivery room were surveyed for possible chart contamination. the outer  surfaces of included charts were sampled by one experienced investigator with sterile cotton swabs rinsed with normal saline. results: for general wards and special units, the overall sampling rates were 81.8% (455/556) and 85.6% (107/125) (p = 0.316); the incidence of chart contamination was 63.5% and 83.2%,  respectively (p<0.001). except for obstetric-gynecologic charts, the incidence was significantly higher in each and in all icus than in corresponding wards. coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most common contaminant in general wards (40.0%) and special units (34.6%) (p>0.05). special units had a significantly higher incidence of bacterial contamination due to staphylococcus aureus (17.8%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (9.3%), streptococcus viridans (9.4%), escherichia coli (11.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), and acinetobacter baumannii (7.5%). logistic regression analysis revealed the incidence of chart contamination was 2- to 4-fold higher in special units than in general wards [odds ratios: 1.97-4.00]. conclusions: noting that most hospital charts are contaminated, our study confirms that a hospital chart is not only a medical record but also an important source of potential infection. the plastic cover of  the medical chart can harbor potential pathogens, thus acting as a vector of bacteria. additionally, chart contamination is more common in icus. these findings highlight the importance of effective hand-washing before and after handling medical charts. however, managers and clinical staff should pay more attention to the issue and may consider some interventions.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity  tests by the kirby-bauer's disc diffusion method. the antibacterial potentiality  of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of nine uropathogens. results: two gram-positive isolates, e. faecalis and s. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. gram-negative isolates a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. methanolic leaf extracts of anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against s. aureus and 28 mm against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for e. faecalis, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa. based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: c. tora >  a. acuminata > schleichera oleosa > pterocarpus santalinus > eugenia jambolana >  bridelia retusa > mimusops elengi > stereospermum kunthianum > tectona grandis >  anthocephalus cadamba. the following eight plants had moderate control capacity:  artocarpus heterophyllus, azadirachta indica, dalbergia latifolia, eucalyptus citriodora, gmelina arborea, pongamia pinnata, pterocarpus marsupium, and shorea  robusta. e. coli, followed by a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. conclusions: a majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against mdr uropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == photodynamic inactivation of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospital wastewaters: influence of residual antibiotics.
AB  == one environmental concern related to hospital effluents is discharge of them without preliminary treatment. antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) may  represent an alternative to the traditional expensive, unsafe and not always effective disinfection methods. the main goal of this work was to assess the efficiency of pdi on clinical multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria in hospital wastewaters in order to evaluate its potential use in treating hospital effluents. the efficiency of pdi was assessed using a cationic porphyrin as the photosensitizer (ps), four mdr bacteria either in phosphate buffered saline or in filtrated hospital wastewaters. the synergistic effect of pdi and antibiotics (ampicillin and chloramphenicol) was also evaluated, as well as the effect of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). the results show the efficient inactivation of mdr bacteria in pbs (reduction of 6-8 log after 270 min of irradiation at 40 w m(-2) with 5.0 mum of ps). in wastewater, the inactivation of the four mdr bacteria was again efficient and the decrease in bacterial survival  starts even sooner. a faster decrease in bacterial survival occurred when pdi was combined with the addition of antibiotics, at sub-inhibitory and inhibitory concentrations, but the sds did not affect the pdi efficiency. it can be concluded that pdi has potential to be an effective alternative for the inactivation of mdr bacteria in hospital wastewaters and that the presence of antibiotics may enhance its effectiveness.

TI  == bugs, hosts and icu environment: countering pan-resistance in nosocomial microbiota and treating bacterial infections in the critical care setting.
AB  == icus are areas where resistance problems are the largest, and these constitute a  major problem for the intensivist's clinical practice. main resistance phenotypes among nosocomial microbiota are (i) vancomycin-resistance/heteroresistance and tolerance in grampositives (mrsa, enterococci) and (ii) efflux pumps/enzymatic resistance mechanisms (esbls, ampc, metallo-betalactamases) in gramnegatives. these phenotypes are found at different rates in pathogens causing respiratory (nosocomial pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia), bloodstream (primary bacteremia/catheter-associated bacteremia), urinary, intraabdominal and surgical  wound infections and endocarditis in the icu. new antibiotics are available to overcome non-susceptibility in grampositives; however, accumulation of resistance traits in gramnegatives has led to multidrug resistance, a worrisome problem nowadays. this article reviews microorganism/infection risk factors for multidrug resistance, suggesting adequate empirical treatments. drugs, patient and environmental factors all play a role in the decision to prescribe/recommend antibiotic regimens in the specific icu patient, implying that intensivists should be familiar with available drugs, environmental epidemiology and patient factors.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. clinical non-duplicate isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and three species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their mics of tigecycline alone and in combination with ppis (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. with one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of ppis on tigecycline activity. the mic changes after ppis addition correlated with the  ppis concentrations in the test media. compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. the time-kill study confirmed that the addition of ppis could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. even at low concentration (5 mg/l) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in e. cloacae  and e. faecalis strains. we conclude that in vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of ppis in a concentration-dependent manner.

TI  == biosynthetic enhancement of the detection of bacteria by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == molecular viability testing (mvt) was previously reported to specifically detect  viable bacterial cells in complex samples. in mvt, brief nutritional stimulation  induces viable cells, but not non-viable cells, to produce abundant amounts of species-specific ribosomal rna precursors (pre-rrna). quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) is used to quantify specific pre-rrnas in a stimulated aliquot relative to a non-stimulated control. in addition to excluding background signal from non-viable cells and from free dna, we report here that mvt increases the analytical sensitivity of qpcr when detecting viable cells. side-by-side limit-of-detection comparisons showed that mvt is 5-fold to >10-fold more sensitive than standard (static) dna-targeted qpcr when detecting diverse bacterial pathogens (aeromonas hydrophila, acinetobacter baumannii, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium, and staphylococcus aureus) in serum, milk, and tap water. sensitivity enhancement may come from the elevated copy number of  pre-rrna relative to genomic dna, and also from the ratiometric measurement which reduces ambiguity associated with weak or borderline signals. we also report that mvt eliminates false positive signals from bacteria that have been inactivated by moderately elevated temperatures (pasteurization), a condition that can confound  widely-used cellular integrity tests that utilize membrane-impermeant compounds such as propidium iodide (pi) or propidium monoazide (pma) to differentiate viable from inactivated bacteria. mvt enables the sensitive and specific detection of very small numbers of viable bacteria in complex matrices.

TI  == transferrin iron starvation therapy for lethal bacterial and fungal infections.
AB  == new strategies to treat antibiotic-resistant infections are urgently needed. we serendipitously discovered that stem cell conditioned media possessed broad antimicrobial properties. biochemical, functional, and genetic assays confirmed that the antimicrobial effect was mediated by supra-physiological concentrations  of transferrin. human transferrin inhibited growth of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative (acinetobacter baumannii), and fungal (candida albicans) pathogens by sequestering iron and disrupting membrane potential. serial passage in subtherapeutic transferrin concentrations resulted in no emergence of resistance. infected mice treated with intravenous human transferrin had improved survival and reduced microbial burden. finally, adjunctive transferrin reduced the emergence of rifampin-resistant mutants of s.  aureus in infected mice treated with rifampin. transferrin is a promising, novel  antimicrobial agent that merits clinical investigation. these results provide proof of principle that bacterial infections can be treated in vivo by attacking  host targets (ie, trace metal availability) rather than microbial targets.

TI  == antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of dispersinb(r)-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
AB  == the medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. as the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of dispersinb((r)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum ksl-w antimicrobial peptide. the combination of dispersinb((r)) and ksl-w peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and  acinetobacter baumannii. in addition, the wound gel formulation comprising dispersinb((r)), ksl-w peptide, and a gelling agent pluronic f-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel silver-sept, dispersinb((r))-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded mrsa, s. epidermidis, cons, vancomycin-resistant  enterococci, a. baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.05). thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial dispersinb((r))-ksl-w wound gel in chronic wound management.

TI  == cold air plasma to decontaminate inanimate surfaces of the hospital environment.
AB  == the hospital environment harbors bacteria that may cause health care-associated infections. microorganisms, such as multiresistant bacteria, can spread around the patient's inanimate environment. some recently introduced biodecontamination  approaches in hospitals have significant limitations due to the toxic nature of the gases and the length of time required for aeration. this study evaluated the  in vitro use of cold air plasma as an efficient alternative to traditional methods of biodecontamination of hospital surfaces. cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia  coli, and acinetobacter baumannii were applied to different materials similar to  those found in the hospital environment. artificially contaminated sections of marmoleum, mattress, polypropylene, powder-coated mild steel, and stainless steel were then exposed to a cold air pressure plasma single jet for 30 s, 60 s, and 90 s, operating at approximately 25 w and 12 liters/min flow rate. direct plasma exposure successfully reduced the bacterial load by log 3 for mrsa, log 2.7 for vre, log 2 for esbl-producing e. coli, and log 1.7 for a. baumannii. the present  report confirms the efficient antibacterial activity of a cold air plasma single-jet plume on nosocomial bacterially contaminated surfaces over a short period of time and highlights its potential for routine biodecontamination in the clinical environment.

AB  == skin secretions from frogs belonging to the genera xenopus, silurana, hymenochirus, and pseudhymenochirus in the family pipidae are a rich source of host-defense peptides with varying degrees of antimicrobial activities and cytotoxicities to mammalian cells. magainin, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf), and xenopsin-precursor fragment (xpf) peptides have been isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from several species of xenopus and silurana. hymenochirins and pseudhymenochirins have been isolated from hymenochirus boettgeri and pseudhymenochirus merlini. a major obstacle to the development of these peptides as anti-infective agents is their hemolytic activities against human erythrocytes. analogs of the magainins,  cpf peptides and hymenochirin-1b with increased antimicrobial potencies and low cytotoxicities have been developed that are active (mic < 5 mum) against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and klebsiella pneumoniae.  despite this, the therapeutic potential of frog skin peptides as anti-infective agents has not been realized so that alternative clinical applications as anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-diabetic, or immunomodulatory drugs are being explored.

TI  == human platelet gel supernatant inactivates opportunistic wound pathogens on skin.
AB  == activation of human platelets produces a gel-like substance referred to as platelet rich plasma or platelet gel. platelet gel is used clinically to promote  wound healing; it also exhibits antimicrobial properties that may aid in the healing of infected wounds. the purpose of this study was to quantify the efficacy of human platelet gel against the opportunistic bacterial wound pathogens acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus on skin. these opportunistic pathogens may exhibit extensive antibiotic resistance, necessitating the development of alternative treatment options. the antimicrobial efficacy of platelet gel supernatants was quantified using an in vitro broth dilution assay, an ex vivo inoculated skin assay, and in an in vivo skin decontamination assay. human platelet gel supernatants were highly bactericidal against a. baumannii and moderately but significantly bactericidal against s. aureus in vitro and in the ex vivo skin model. p. aeruginosa was not inactivated in vitro; a low but significant inactivation level was observed ex vivo. these supernatants were quite effective at inactivating a model organism on skin in vivo. these results suggest application of platelet gel has potential clinical applicability, not only in the acceleration of wound healing, but also against relevant bacteria causing wound infections.

TI  == could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
AB  == the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found  to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.

TI  == evaluation of factors affecting mortality in fournier's gangrene: retrospective clinical study of sixteen cases.
AB  == objective: fournier's gangrene is a progressive, necrotizing fasciitis due to synergistic infection of the perineum and external genitalia that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. the purpose of this study is to review the diagnostic and treatment methods that effect mortality in fournier's gangrene. material and methods: sixteen patients who were diagnosed and treated at our clinic between 2011 and 2013 due to fournier's gangrene were retrospectively analyzed. the surviving and non-surviving patient groups were compared in terms of age, sex, onset time of symptoms, isolated microorganisms, concomitant diseases, fournier's gangrene severity index (fgsi), and length of hospital stay. results: ten of our cases (62.5%) were male and six (37.5%) were female, with a mean age of 61.2+/-12.3 (42-73) years. the mortality rate was 18.8% (3 cases). the mean duration of symptoms before admission was 4.31+/-1.81 (2-8) days. this period was 6.67+/-1.52 days in patients who succumbed to death, and 3.77+/-1.42 days in patients who survived (p=0.007). ten cases (62.5%) had concomitant diabetes mellitus. the most common organism isolated in wound cultures was escherichia coli (68.7%), and acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. in the remaining patients. the mean fgsi of surviving patients was 3.84+/-1.77, and 7.66+/-0.57 in fatal cases (p=0.003). the mean length of hospital stay was 25.5 days (2-57) and duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in survivors (p<0.05). conclusion: the delay in diagnosis and higher fgsi may be responsible for worsening of prognosis and mortality in fournier's gangrene. early diagnosis  and determination of the severity of the disease, aggressive surgical debridement and appropriate antimicrobial therapy may improve prognosis.

TI  == health care workers' hand contamination levels and antibacterial efficacy of different hand hygiene methods used in a vietnamese hospital.
AB  == background: handwashing with soap or another antisepsis disinfectant solution is  a common practice in vietnam, but the availability and quality of tap water is unpredictable. we assessed the risk for hand contamination and compared the efficacy of 5 hand hygiene methods in a tertiary vietnamese hospital. methods: five fingertip imprints of the dominant hand of 134 health care workers (hcws) were sampled to establish the average bacterial count before and after hand hygiene action using (1) alcohol-based handrub (abhr), (2) plain soap and water handwashing with filtered and unfiltered water, or (3) 4% chlorhexidine gluconate hand antisepsis with filtered and unfiltered water. results: average bacterial contamination of hands before hand hygiene was 1.65 log(10). acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus were the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens. the highest average count before hand hygiene was recovered from hcws without direct patient contact (2.10 +/- 0.11 log(10)). bacterial counts were markedly reduced after hand hygiene with abhr (1.4 log(10); p < .0001) and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate with filtered water (0.8  log(10); p < .0001). use of unfiltered water was associated with minimal nonsignificant bacterial reduction. conclusions: hcws carry high levels of bacteria on their dominant hand, even without direct patient contact. abhr as an  additional step may overcome the effect of high bacterial counts in unfiltered water when soap and water handwashing is indicated.

TI  == analysis of some common pathogens and their drug resistance to antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to investigate the common bacterial resistance of clinical isolates in our hospital in the second half of 2011. methodology: pathogens isolated from clinical samples in the second half of 2011 were analyzed and categorized to perform susceptibility tests. results: in the gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli accounted for 55.89%  and 34.51%. in the gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus, strptococcus pneumonia accounted  for 32.85%, 40.39%, 12.41% and 10.22%, respectively. other species accounted for  4.14%. klebsiella pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to cepoperazon, cefepime and imipenem. however,acinetobacter baumannii was more sensitive to carbapenems antibiotics, which was followed by fourth generation cephalosporins. klebsiella pneumoniae was extremely sensitive to amikacin, cefepime and imipenem, but was resistant to ampicillin. the detection rates of the broad-spectrum escherichia coli, pseudomonasaeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae were 54.51%, 52.08% and 38.65%. the gram negative bacilli were the prevalent clinical pathogens in our hospital in the second half of 2011. conclusion: the drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria has increased significantly recently, thus the surveillance of antibacterial agents is necessary, and rational use of antibiotic will be urgently needed to reduce the production and dissemination of drug resistant strains.

TI  == validation of a novel murine wound model of acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  == patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by eskape pathogens, which include a. baumannii (the eskape pathogens are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). as new therapies are being developed to counter a. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. the model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. a 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. uninoculated control wounds healed within 13  days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days.  treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16s rrna community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. the range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. the model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals.

TI  == bioactive glass bag-s53p4 for the adjunctive treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long bones: an in vitro and prospective clinical study.
AB  == background: this study aimed to explore the in vitro antibacterial activity of the bioglass bag s53p4 against multi-resistant microorganisms commonly involved in osteomyelitis and to evaluate its use in surgical adjunctive treatment of osteomyelitis. methods: in vitro antibacterial activity of bag-s53p4 against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii isolates was evaluated by means of time kill curves, with colony counts performed after 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. in vivo evaluation was performed by prospectively studying a cohort of 27 patients with a clinically and radiologically diagnosed osteomyelitis of the long bones in an observational study. endpoints were the absence of infection recurrence/persistence at follow-up, no need for further surgery whenever during follow-up and absence of local or systemic side effects connected with the bag use. results: in vitro tests regarding the antibacterial activity of bag s53p4 showed a marked bactericidal activity after 24 hrs against  all the tested species. this activity continued in the subsequent 24 hrs and no growth was observed for all strains after 72 hrs. results of the clinical study evidenced no signs of infection in 24 patients (88.9%) at the follow-up, while 2  subjects showed infection recurrence at 6 months from index operation and one more needed further surgical procedures. bag-s53p4 was generally well tolerated.  conclusions: the in vitro and in vivo findings reinforce previous observations on the efficacy of bag-s53p4 for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long  bones, also in the presence of multi-resistant strains and in immunocompromised hosts, without relevant side effects and without the need for locally adding antibiotics. trial registration: deutschen register klinischer studien (drks) unique identifier: drks00005332.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fibrin sealants containing antimicrobial agents.
AB  == background: antimicrobial prophylaxis is required to prevent surgical site infections (ssis). however, it is difficult to maintain prolonged antimicrobial activity in the surgical incision. fibrin sealants are used primarily for hemostasis, suture support, or the adhesion of tissues. the aim of this study was to develop fibrin sealants that exhibit antimicrobial activity due to the addition of an antimicrobial agent. methods: we determined the potencies and activities of cefazolin, ampicillin-sulbactam, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and arbekacin eluted from fibrin sealants. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp), and multi-drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mdrab), which are the major pathogens responsible for hospital-acquired infections. results: each antimicrobial agent eluted continuously from the fibrin clots for approximately two weeks. all eluates from fibrin clots containing antimicrobial agents maintained antimicrobial activity against mrsa for at least  7 d. the eluates from fibrin clots containing ampicillin-sulbactam inhibited the  growth of both mdrp and mdrab for at least 5 d. conclusion: our data suggest that the addition of an antimicrobial agent to fibrin sealants is a useful method to prevent ssis caused by bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant strains.

TI  == blood stream infections in patients in the burn intensive care unit.
AB  == background: the study on bacteremia helps empirically select the proper antibiotics before the results of culture test about causative pathogen. the purpose of this study is to investigate causative pathogen in bloodstream infection, changing aspects based on elapsed time after burn, relationship with other sites and resistance of important causative pathogen against antibiotics through analysis on bacteria isolated from blood culture of patients hospitalized in burn intensive care unit (bicu). materials and methods: a retrospective study  was conducted targeting patients hospitalized in bicu from january 2007 to june 2011. changes of causative pathogen in bloodstream infection based on elapsed time after injury were analyzed. we would like to examine the relationship between bloodstream infection and infection on other body parts by comparing results of cultures in burn wound site, sputum, urine and catheter tip. antibiotics resistance patterns of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus species, and klebsiella pneumoniae were studied. results: a total of 2,337 burn patients were hospitalized in bicu for 54 months. causative pathogen was cultured in blood cultures from 397 patients (17.0%). p. aeruginosa (169, 30.1%) was the most cultured and a. baumannii (107, 19.0%) and s. aureus (81, 14.4%) were followed. it was confirmed  that the relative frequency of a. baumannii tended to get lower as the period got longer after injury, but the relative frequency of k. pneumoniae got higher as the period got longer after injury. with comparison without bacteremia, p. aeruginosa bacteremia showed high probability in which the same bacteria were cultured in wound site, sputum and cathether tip, and a. baumannii bacteremia and candida bacteremia had high probability in sputum, and urine and catheter tip, respectively. 95.9% of p. aeruginosa and 95.3% of a. baumannii showed the resistance against carbapenem. 96.3% of s. aureus was methicillin resistant and 36.2% of enterococcus species were vancomycin resistant. 75.0% of k. pneumonia were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria. conclusions: since the highly antibiotic resistant microorganisms were isolated from the patients hospitalized in bicu during early phase, the empirical selection of antibiotics targeting these pathogens should be considered before the results of  microbiologic culture test. in addition, use of empirical antifungal agent after  1 week of injury can be considered for patients who have risk factor of fungal infection.

TI  == prospects for new antibacterials: can we do better?
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibacterial drugs has been increasing relentlessly over the past two decades. this includes common residents of the human body: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant or mrsa) enteroccus faecalis and e.  faecium (vancomycin resistant or vre): enterobacteriaceae (multiresistant, carbapenems included or cre). it also includes environmental, opportunistic, but  intrinsically multiresistant species: pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. financial considerations have curtailed r&d activity in the antibacterial field in all, but a couple of large pharmaceutical companies and small biotech companies have largely been unable to fill the drug discovery gap.  antibacterials currently under development have targeted, almost exclusively, gram-positive bacteria; hence, greater effort must be directed against gram-negative bacteria, particularly enterobacteria. there also has to be more transparency and care in clinical development. to get ahead of the problem of resistance, we must look for first-in-class antibacterials and new targets. the need to innovate is best addressed through partnerships between drug-makers and public institutions. such partnerships would provide a long-term view and stability to projects, but also balance the interests of corporate and public stakeholders.

TI  == membrane interactions and biological activity of antimicrobial peptides from australian scorpion.
AB  == uyct peptides are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the venom of the australian scorpion. the activity of the uyct peptides against gram positive and  gram negative bacteria and red blood cells was determined. the membrane interactions of these peptides were evaluated by dye release (dr) of the fluorophore calcein from liposomes and isothermal titration calorimetry (itc); and their secondary structure was determined by circular dichroism (cd). three different lipid systems were used to mimic red blood cells, escherichia coli and  staphylococcus aureus membranes. uyct peptides exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity with low mic for s. aureus and multi-drug resistant gram negative strains. peptide combinations showed some synergy enhancing their potency but not hemolytic activity. the uyct peptides adopted a helical structure in lipid environments and dr results confirmed that the mechanism of action is by disrupting the membrane. itc data indicated that uyct peptides preferred prokaryotic rather than eukaryotic membranes. the overall results suggest that uyct peptides could be pharmaceutical leads for the treatment of gram negative multiresistant bacterial infections, especially against acinetobacter baumanni, and candidates for peptidomimetics to enhance their potency and minimize hemolysis. this article is part of a special issue entitled: interfacially active peptides and proteins. guest editors: william c. wimley and kalina hristova.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and wound-healing property of a topical ointment containing nitric-oxide-loaded zeolites.
AB  == topical delivery of nitric oxide (no) through a wound dressing has the potential  to reduce wound infections and improve healing of acute and chronic wounds. this  study characterized the antibacterial efficacy of an ointment containing no-loaded, zinc-exchanged zeolite a that releases no upon contact with water. the release rate of no from the ointment was measured using a chemiluminescence detection system. minimum bactericidal concentration assays were performed using  five common wound pathogens, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis  and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) and a fungus (candida albicans).  the time dependence of antimicrobial activity was characterized by performing log-reduction assays at four time points after 1-8 h ointment exposure. the cytotoxicity of the ointment after 24 h was assessed using cultured 3t3 fibroblast cells. minimum microbicidal concentrations (mmcs) for bacterial organisms (5x10(7) c.f.u.) ranged from 50 to 100 mg ointment (ml media)(-1); the  mmc for c. albicans (5x10(4) c.f.u.) was 50 mg ointment (ml media)(-1). five to eight log reductions in bacterial viability and three log reductions in fungal viability were observed after 8 h exposure to no-zeolite ointment compared with untreated organisms. fibroblasts remained viable after 24 h exposure to the same  concentration of no-zeolite ointment as was used in antimicrobial tests. in parallel studies, full-thickness cutaneous wounds on zucker obese rats healed faster than wounds treated with a control ointment. these data indicate that ointment containing no-loaded zeolites could potentially be used as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial wound-healing dressing.

TI  == an analog of the host-defense peptide hymenochirin-1b with potent broad-spectrum  activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and immunomodulatory properties.
AB  == hymenochirin-1b (iklspetkdn(10)lkkvlkgaik(20)gaiavakmv.nh2) is a cationic, amphipathic, alpha-helical, host-defense peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the congo clawed frog hymenochirus boettgeri (pipidae). structure-activity relationships were investigated by synthesizing analogs in which the pro(5), glu(6) and asp(9) on the hydrophilic face of the alpha-helix are substituted by one or more l-lysine or d-lysine residues. although replacement with l-lysine generates analogs with increased antimicrobial potency  against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (up to 8-fold), the peptides are more hemolytic. increasing the cationicity of hymenochirin-1b while  reducing the helicity by substitutions with d-lysine generates analogs that are between 2 and 8 fold more potent than the native peptide and are equally or less  hemolytic. [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b represents a candidate for drug development as it shows high potency against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and a range of gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic in the range 0.8-3.1 mum) and ndm-1 carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii (mic in the range 3.1-6.25 mum), and low hemolytic activity (lc50=302 mum). [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b, at a concentration of 2.5 mum, significantly (p<0.05) stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear  cells but is without significant effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and il-17.

TI  == epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant eskape pathogens in cancer patients.
AB  == purpose: infection due to the six eskape pathogens has recently been identified as a serious emerging problem. however, there is still a lack of information on bacteremia caused by these organisms in cancer patients. we aimed to assess the epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant eskape pathogens (reskape) in patients with cancer. methods: all episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized adults with cancer from 2006  to 2011 were analyzed. results: of 1,148 episodes of bacteremia, 392 (34 %) were  caused by eskape pathogens. fifty-four episodes (4.7 %) were due to reskape strains (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium 0, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 13, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (eslb)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae 7, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 4, carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and derepression chromosomic ss-lactam and esbl-producing enterobacter species 12. risk factors independently associated with reskape bacteremia were comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, urinary catheter and urinary tract source. inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in the other cases (55.6 % vs. 21.5 %, p < 0.001). persistence of bacteremia (25 % vs. 9.7 %), septic metastasis (8 % vs. 4 %) and early case-fatality rate (23 % vs. 11 %) were more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in patients with other etiologies (p < 0.05). conclusions: bacteremia due to reskape pathogens in cancer patients occurs mainly among those with comorbidities who have received prior antibiotic therapy and have a urinary tract source. these patients often receive inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and have a poor outcome.

TI  == short antibacterial peptides with significantly reduced hemolytic activity can be identified by a systematic l-to-d exchange scan of their amino acid residues.
AB  == high systemic toxicity of antimicrobial peptides (amps) limits their clinical application to the treatment of topical infections; in parenteral systemic application of amps the problem of hemolysis is one of the first to be tackled. we now show that the selectivity of lipidated short synthetic amps can be optimized substantially by reducing their hemolytic activity without affecting their activity against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in order to identify the optimized peptides, two sets of 32 diastereomeric h-(d)arg-wrwrw-(l)lys(c(o)cnh2n+1)-nh2 (n = 7 or 9) peptides were prepared using  a split-split procedure to perform a systematic l-to-d exchange scan on the central wrwrw-fragment. compared to the all-l c8-lipidated lead sequence, diastereomeric peptides had very similar antibacterial properties, but were over  30 times less hemolytic. we show that the observed hemolysis and antibacterial activity is affected by both differences in lipophilicity of the different peptides and specific combinations of l- and d-amino acid residues. this study identified several peptides that can be used as tools to precisely unravel the origin of hemolysis and thus help to design even further optimized nontoxic very  active short antibacterial peptides.

AB  == arg-annot (antibiotic resistance gene-annotation) is a new bioinformatic tool that was created to detect existing and putative new antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in bacterial genomes. arg-annot uses a local blast program in bio-edit software that allows the user to analyze sequences without a web interface. all ar genetic determinants were collected from published works and online resources; nucleotide and protein sequences were retrieved from the ncbi genbank database. after building a database that includes 1,689 antibiotic resistance genes, the software was tested in a blind manner using 100 random sequences selected from the database to verify that the sensitivity and specificity were at 100% even when partial sequences were queried. notably, blast analysis results obtained using the rmtf gene sequence (a new aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene sequence that is not included in the database) as a query revealed that the tool was able  to link this sequence to short sequences (17 to 40 bp) found in other genes of the rmt family with significant e values. finally, the analysis of 178 acinetobacter baumannii and 20 staphylococcus aureus genomes allowed the detection of a significantly higher number of ar genes than the resfinder gene analyzer and 11 point mutations in target genes known to be associated with ar. the average time for the analysis of a genome was 3.35 +/- 0.13 min. we have created a concise database for blast using a bio-edit interface that can detect ar genetic determinants in bacterial genomes and can rapidly and easily discover  putative new ar genetic determinants.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and sar study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  == a series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. they were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida krusei, and candida albicans. in this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan  spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface  active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). then, we present a sar study for staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the dominance-based rough set approach (drsa), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. the sar study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial  activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.

TI  == [analysis of resistance tendency of bloodstream-infecting pathogens in china].
AB  == objective: to investigate the resistance profiles and the trend of bloodstream-infecting pathogens isolated from hospitalized patients during 2004-2010. methods: the bloodstream isolates were collected from 18 hospitals in  17 cities. minimum inhibition concentrations (mic) were determined using the agar dilution method recommended by clsi (clinical and laboratory standards institute), and susceptibility results were analyzed according to the 2011 clsi guideline. results: among the 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 periods, the proportions of clinical isolates were similar; 43.1% (149 isolates), 34.0% (151 isolates) and 47.5% (776 isolates) for gram positive strains, 56.9% (197 isolates), 66.0% (293 isolates) and 52.5% (858 isolates) for gram negative strains, respectively. the isolating rate of mrsa was 54.1% (20/37) in 2007-2008, which was the highest among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010, while it decreased in 2009-2010 (36.5%, 62/170). the mrcns proportions were similar across the 3 periods. one (1.8%) vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and 1 linezolid-resistant enterococcus faecalis were found. although the isolating rates of penicillin non-sensitive strains (oral) were similar between 2009-2010 and 2007-2008 [54.5% (6/11) and 53.9% (7/13), respectively], the resistant rates  increased from 0% in 2007-2008 to 30.8% (4/13) in 2009-2010. the results were similar according to the non-meningitis criterion (iv), and the susceptibility rates decreased from 100.0% (11 isolates) in 2007-2008 to 84.6% (11/13) in 2009-2010. esbl-harboring strains in e. coli were similar among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010 [66.7% (30/45), 73.2% (71/97) and 67.9% (233/343), respectively]. esbl-producing strains in klebsilla pnuemoniae decreased year after year, 72.4% (21/29), 50.0% (18/36) and 41.1% (65/158) in 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively. except that the sensitive rate of enterobacter cloacae to ertapenem was 80% (32/40), the sensitive rates of other strains to carbapenems were still above 90% and the resistance rates were less than 5%. acinetobacter baumannii had the highest multi-drug resistance rate (81.8%, 81/99). one strain (1.0%, 1/99) of acinetobacter baumannii isolated in 2009-2010 was reported to be pan-resistant. conclusions: we are facing a more serious situation of bacterial resistance. acinetobacter baumannii resistance was most serious, usually with the characteristics of multiple drug resistance, and even pan-resistance. carbapenems remain to be the most effective against enterobacteriaceae. strains resistant to novel antibiotics (linezolid and tigecycline) have emerged.

TI  == a novel alkaloid from marine-derived actinomycete streptomyces xinghaiensis with  broad-spectrum antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.
AB  == due to the increasing emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and tumor cell lines,  novel antibiotics with antibacterial and cytotoxic activities are urgently needed. marine actinobacteria are rich sources of novel antibiotics, and here we  report the discovery of a novel alkaloid, xinghaiamine a, from a marine-derived actinomycete streptomyces xinghaiensis nrrl b24674(t). xinghaiamine a was purified from the fermentation broth, and its structure was elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1d and 2d nmr spectrum as well as mass spectrometry. xinghaiamine a was identified to be a novel alkaloid with highly symmetric structure on the basis of sulfoxide functional group, and sulfoxide containing compound has so far never been reported in microorganisms. biological assays revealed that xinghaiamine a exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activities to both gram-negative persistent hospital pathogens (e.g. acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli) and gram-positive ones, which include staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis. in addition, xinghaiamine a also exhibited potent cytotoxic activity to human cancer cell lines of mcf-7 and u-937 with the ic50 of 0.6 and 0.5 microm, respectively.

TI  == rapid systemic and local treatments with the antibacterial peptide dimer a3-apo and its monomeric metabolite eliminate bacteria and reduce inflammation in intradermal lesions infected with propionibacterium acnes and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == when administered intramuscularly, the designer antibacterial peptide dimer a3-apo is highly efficacious in mouse models of acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus burn infections. here we compared the efficacy of a3-apo and its monomeric metabolite in mouse models of s. aureus and propionibacterium acnes intradermal infections following administration as intramuscular (i.m.) or  topical treatments. in the animal models, either (i) the ears of cd-1 mice were infected with p. acnes or (ii) s. aureus was injected into burn wounds inflicted  to the back. a3-apo or the monomer were injected intramuscularly at 5 mg/kg one to three times or were applied three times as 1% local treatment in phosphate-buffered saline or vaseline((r)). despite being inactive against the strains in vitro, in vivo the skin conditions of the mice were dramatically improved upon peptide treatment regardless of dosing frequency, administration mode or drug valency. in the p. acnes study, a3-apo statistically significantly reduced ear thickness and ear bacterial counts. the amount of ear connective tissue and epithelial macrophages correlated with therapeutic success. bacterial  load in the lesions was more representative of physical improvement than ear dimensions. in the s. aureus model, both peptides eliminated wound bacteria from  >10(7) cfu/mg to almost background levels, with monomer treatment being somewhat  more successful. in conclusion, a3-apo and its monomeric metabolite very efficiently ameliorate resistant aerobic and anaerobic intradermal infections, but the protection is apparently not due to direct bacterial killing. immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory actions are likely involved. nevertheless, topical and i.m. administrations are equally effective.

TI  == [health care associated multidrug-resistant bacteria in a pediatric hospital: five year experience].
AB  == introduction: in recent years there has been an increase of infections caused by  multidrug-resistant bacteria. paediatric data are scarce, particularly at national level. aims: to analyse trends of health-care associated multidrug-resistant bacteria infections in a paediatric hospital. material and methods: a retrospective incidence study was conducted in medical, surgical and intensive care wards in a level iii paediatric hospital, from january 2005 to december 2009. the studied multidrug-resistant bacteria were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), esbl-producing bacilli, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp, multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa-mdr) and acinetobacter baumannii resistant to carbapenems. demographic, clinical and laboratory data, treatment and presence of risk factors for these infections were analysed. results: during the study period 106 multidrug-resistant bacteria were identified, related to 72 children, predominantly male (65.3%). the most frequently identified multidrug-resistant bacteria were mrsa (35.8%), pa-mdr (29.2%) and esbl-producing bacilli (17.9%). of the 106 multidrug-resistant bacteria, 45 (42.5%) were causing infection. during the study period the annual proportion of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria went up from 32.0% in 2006 to 55.6% in 2009 (p = 0.376). the overall incidence rate of infection was 0.400 per 1 000 hospitalization-days, corresponding to 0.274 infections per 100 admissions, remaining stable over the five years. the most frequent infections were bloodstream (31.1%), intra-abdominal (20.0%), catheter-related (17.8%) and skin and soft tissue (11.1%). all children had risk factors and the most frequently identified were previous antibiotic therapy and underlying chronic disease (> 90%). six children (13.3%) died during hospitalisation. conclusions: during the study period, there was an increase in the proportion of multidrug-resistant bacteria but with no statistical significance. the overall incidence rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria infection remained stable. mrsa were the most frequently identified bacteria, followed by pa-mdr and esbl-producing bacilli. bloodstream infections were the most frequent infections, followed by intra-abdominal and catheter-related. all children had risk factors, mainly previous antibiotic therapy and chronic disease.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  == there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial  materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential  applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.

TI  == lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == rationale: bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. methods: lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. in this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-auncs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. after bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-auncs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-aunc-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. the red emission from the auncs on the conjugates could be  visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. the bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms) combined with principal component analysis (pca). results: we demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-auncs and distinguished by the results combining maldi-ms and pca. additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to  differentiate e. faecalis from vre was also demonstrated. the lowest detection concentration for e. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/ml. conclusions: the results indicated that the lysozyme-auncs are effective affinity probes for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. by combining the results from maldi-ms and pca, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. the current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.

TI  == bloodstream infection in patients with end-stage renal disease in a teaching hospital in central-western brazil.
AB  == introduction: vascular access in patients undergoing hemodialysis is considered a critical determinant of bloodstream infection (bsi) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. the purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of bsi in patients with end-stage renal disease using central venous catheters for hemodialysis. methods: a cohort study was conducted in a public teaching hospital in central-western brazil from april 2010 to december 2011. for every patient, we noted the presence of hyperemia/exudation upon catheter insertion, as well as fever, shivering, and chills during hemodialysis. results:  fifty-nine patients were evaluated. thirty-fi ve (59.3%) patients started dialysis due to urgency, 37 (62.7%) had bsi, and 12 (20%) died. hyperemia at the  catheter insertion site (64.9%) was a significant clinical manifestation in patients with bsi. statistical analysis revealed 1.7 times more cases of bsi in patients with hypoalbuminemia compared with patients with normal albumin levels.  the principal infective agents identified in blood cultures and catheter-tip cultures were staphylococcus species (24 cases), non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (7 cases of stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 5 cases of chryseobacterium  indologenes), and candida species (6). among the staphylococci identified, 77.7%  were methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. of the bacteria isolated, the most resistant were chryseobacterium indologenes and acinetobacter  baumannii. conclusions: blood culture was demonstrated to be an important diagnostic test and identified over 50% of positive bsi cases. the high frequency of bsi and the isolation of multiresistant bacteria were disturbing findings. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated microorganism, although gram-negative bacteria predominated overall. these results highlight the importance of infection prevention and control measures in dialysis units.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of amazonian medicinal plants.
AB  == objectives: the aqueous extracts of currently utilized amazonian medicinal plants were assayed in vitro searching for antimicrobial activity against human and animal pathogenic microorganisms. methods: medium resuspended lyophilized aqueous extracts of different organs of amazonian medicinal plants were assayed by in vitro screening for antimicrobial activity. atcc and standardized microorganisms  obtained from oswaldo cruz foundation/brazil were individually and homogeneously  grown in agar plate, and holes previously perforated in the gel were filled with  diluted plant aqueous extracts. inhibition halos were evaluated and controlled by the use of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. results: the amazonian medicinal plants, hymenelobium petraeum showed inhibitory activity over staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans, while vatairea guianensis and symphonia globulifera presented inhibitory activity exclusively for staphylococcus aureus.  also, ptychopetalum olacoides and pentaclethra macroloba inhibited the growth of  klebsiella ozaenae and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: the aqueous botanic extracts that showed activity against microroganisms of attc and osvaldo cruz strains had at least 40% of antimicrobial activity when compared to halo inhibition produced by the commercial antibiotic ciprofloxacin utilized as a control. of all plants extracts assayed, the hymenelobium petraeum had the best performance, sometimes exhibiting higher activity than ciprofloxacin. it is not well-defined by the physicians the exact indication of the majority of medicinal  plants in the amazon area in brazil. natives utilize the plants according to their symptoms, based on the traditional knowledge transmitted orally from generation to generation, among amerindians, afrodescendents and ethnic mixed populations. a significant number of amazonian medicinal plants are totally unknown related to their medicinal properties including mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, as very few information is reported in the scientific literature. a tiny amount of data is presented, as the preliminary antimicrobial  properties of the medicinal plants here accessed, under the urgent necessity of new antibiotics in the market and in face of the increased resistance of infectious microorganisms to antimicrobials.

TI  == chlorhexidine activity against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == background: a biofilm is a complex microbiological ecosystem deposited on surfaces. microorganisms in form of biofilms are of particular clinical concern because of the poor response to antimicrobial treatments. this study aimed to determine whether bacterial and fungal biofilms are able to resist the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine, a powerful antiseptic widely used in the hospital environment. methods: disk diffusion and susceptibility tests were conducted in accordance with clinical and laboratory standards institute standards for the determination of biofilm inhibitory concentration. chlorhexidine was tested first at a minimum inhibitory concentration and then at  higher concentrations when it was not able to destroy the biofilm. the plates were developed with a solution of 0.1% crystal violet, and readings were made at  an optical density of 570 nm. results: chlorhexidine demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activity for most microorganisms tested in their free form, but was less effective against biofilms of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: this study confirms that microorganisms in biofilms have greater resistance to chlorhexidine, likely owing to the mechanisms of resistance conferred to the structure of biofilms.

AB  == use of nanoparticles is among the most promising strategies to overcome microbial drug resistance. this review article consists of three parts. the first part discusses the epidemiology of microbial drug resistance. the second part describes mechanisms of drug resistance used by microbes. the third part explains how nanoparticles can overcome this resistance, including the following: nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticles (no nps), chitosan-containing nanoparticles (chitosan nps), and metal-containing nanoparticles all use multiple mechanisms simultaneously to combat microbes, thereby making development of resistance to these nanoparticles unlikely. packaging multiple antimicrobial agents within the  same nanoparticle also makes development of resistance unlikely. nanoparticles can overcome existing drug resistance mechanisms, including decreased uptake and  increased efflux of drug from the microbial cell, biofilm formation, and intracellular bacteria. finally, nanoparticles can target antimicrobial agents to the site of infection, so that higher doses of drug are given at the infected site, thereby overcoming resistance.

TI  == anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activities of ethanol extracts of selected traditional chinese medicinal herbs.
AB  == objective: to evaluate in vitro antimicrobial activities of selected 58 ethno-medicinal plant extracts with a view to assess their therapeutic potential. methods: a total of 58 traditional chinese medicinal plants were carefully selected based on the literature review and their traditional use. the antimicrobial activities of ethanol extracts of these medicinal plants were tested against fungi (aspergillus fumigatus), yeast (candida albicans), gram-negative (acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus). the activities were tested at three different concentrations of 1.00, 0.10 and 0.01 mg/ml. the data was analysed using gene data screener program. results: the measured antimicrobial activities indicated that out of the 58 plant extracts, 15 extracts showed anti-fungal activity and 23 extracts exhibited anti-bacterial activity. eight plant extracts have exhibited both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. for instance, eucommia ulmoides, polygonum cuspidatum, poria cocos and uncaria rhyncophylla showed activity against both bacterial and fungal strains, indicating their broad spectrum of activity. conclusions: the results revealed that the ethanol extracts of 30 plants out of the selected 58 possess significant antimicrobial activities. it is interesting to note that the findings from the current study are consistent with the traditional use. a clear correlation has also been found between the antimicrobial activity and the flavonoid content of the plant extracts which is in agreement with the literature. hence, the results  presented here can be used to guide the selection of potential plant species for  the isolation and structure elucidation of novel antimicrobial compounds in order to establish the structure-activity relationship. this in turn is expected to lead the way to the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents for therapeutic use.

AB  == to evaluate the ability of clo2 to decontaminate pathogens known to cause healthcare-associated infections in a hospital room strains of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and  staphylococcus aureus were spot placed in duplicate pairs at 10 sites throughout  a hospital room and then exposed to clo2 gas. organisms were collected and evaluated for reduction in colony forming units following gas exposure. six sterilization cycles with varied gas concentrations, exposure limits, and relative humidity levels were conducted. reductions in viable organisms achieved  ranged from 7 to 10-log reductions. two sterilization cycles failed to produce complete inactivation of organisms placed in a bathroom with the door closed. reductions of organisms in the bathroom ranged from 6-log to 10-log reductions. gas leakage between hospital floors did not occur; however, some minor gas leakage from the door of hospital room was measured which was subsequently sealed to prevent further leakage. novel technologies for disinfection of hospital rooms require validation and safety testing in clinical environments. gaseous clo2 is effective for sterilizing environmental contamination in a hospital room. concentrations of clo2 up to 385 ppm were safely maintained in a hospital room with enhanced environmental controls.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of a novel silver hydrogel dressing compared to two common silver burn wound dressings: acticoat and polymem silver((r)).
AB  == a novel burn wound hydrogel dressing has been previously developed which is composed of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid sodium salt with silver nanoparticles. this study compared the antimicrobial efficacy of this novel dressing to two commercially available silver dressings; acticoat and polymem silver((r)). three different antimicrobial tests were used: disc diffusion, broth culture, and the live/dead((r)) baclight bacterial viability assay. burn wound pathogens (p. aeruginosa, mssa, a. baumannii and c. albicans) and antibiotic resistant strains (mrsa and vre) were tested. all three antimicrobial tests indicated that acticoat was the most effective antimicrobial agent, with inhibition zone lengths of 13.9-18.4mm. it reduced the microbial inocula below the limit of detection (10(2)cfu/ml) and reduced viability by 99% within 4h. polymem silver((r)) had no zone of inhibition for most tested micro-organisms, and it also showed poor antimicrobial activity in the broth culture and live/dead((r)) baclight assays. alarmingly, it appeared to promote the growth of  vre. the silver hydrogel reduced most of the tested microbial inocula below the detection limit and decreased bacterial viability by 94-99% after 24h exposure. these results support the possibility of using this novel silver hydrogel as a burn wound dressing in the future.

TI  == identification of a novel antimicrobial peptide from human hepatitis b virus core protein arginine-rich domain (ard).
AB  == the rise of multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens causes an increasing challenge to public health. antimicrobial peptides are considered a possible solution to this  problem. hbv core protein (hbc) contains an arginine-rich domain (ard) at its c-terminus, which consists of 16 arginine residues separated into four clusters (ard i to iv). in this study, we demonstrated that the peptide containing the full-length ard i-iv (hbc147-183) has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity at  micro-molar concentrations, including some mdr and colistin (polymyxin e)-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. furthermore, confocal fluorescence microscopy and sytox green uptake assay indicated that this peptide killed gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria by membrane permeabilization or dna binding. in addition, peptide ard ii-iv (hbc153-176) and ard i-iii (hbc147-167) were found to be necessary and sufficient for the activity against p. aeruginosa  and k. peumoniae. the antimicrobial activity of hbc ard peptides can be attenuated by the addition of lps. hbc ard peptide was shown to be capable of direct binding to the lipid a of lipopolysaccharide (lps) in several in vitro binding assays. peptide ard i-iv (hbc147-183) had no detectable cytotoxicity in various tissue culture systems and a mouse animal model. in the mouse model by intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation with staphylococcus aureus, timely treatment by i.p. injection with ard peptide resulted in 100-fold reduction of bacteria load in blood, liver and spleen, as well as 100% protection of inoculated animals from death. if peptide was injected when bacterial load in the blood reached its  peak, the protection rate dropped to 40%. similar results were observed in k. peumoniae using an ivis imaging system. the finding of anti-microbial hbc ard is  discussed in the context of commensal gut microbiota, development of intrahepatic anti-viral immunity and establishment of chronic infection with hbv. our current  results suggested that hbc ard could be a new promising antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == design and construction of a single tube, quantitative endpoint, late-pcr multiplex assay for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == aims: the goal of this study was to develop a molecular diagnostic multiplex assay for the quantitative detection of microbial pathogens commonly responsible  for ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and their antibiotic resistance using linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (late-pcr). method and results: this multiplex assay was designed for the quantitative detection and identification of pathogen genomic dna of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, plus a control target from lactococcus lactis. after amplification, the single-stranded amplicons were detected simultaneously in the same closed tube by hybridization to low-temperature molecular beacon probes labelled with four differently coloured fluorophores. the resulting hybrids were then analysed by determining the fluorescence intensity of each of the four fluorophores as a function of temperature. conclusions: this late-pcr single tube multiplex assay generated endpoint fluorescent contours that allowed identification of all microbial pathogens commonly responsible for vap, including mrsa. the assay was quantitative, identifying the pathogens present in the sample, no matter whether  there were as few as 10 or as many 100 000 target genomes. significance and impact of the study: this assay is rapid, reliable and sensitive and is ready for preclinical testing using samples recovered from patients suffering from ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  == a rabbit osteomyelitis model to simulate multibacterial war wound infections.
AB  == a challenge facing military caregivers is the presence of multidrug-resistant infection in extremity wounds. most frequently identified resistant strains are methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae (kp), pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), and acinetobacter baumannii (ab). we adapted an existing osteomyelitis model to simulate an infected extremity wound for antibiotic testing. new zealand white rabbits (n = 95) were divided into 6 inoculation groups for infection with mrsa, kp, pa, and ab alone, and in multibacteria infections. sodium morrhuate was injected into the left tibia to simulate blast wound trauma, then the respective bacteria or combination of pathogens, and finally sterile saline were injected. colony-forming units for the mono-organism groups showed that ab, kp, or pa alone at 10(7) colony-forming units per ml (cfus/ml) was effective for rabbit osteomyelitis induction. colony-forming units for the multiorganism groups showed that the combination of  ab (10(7) cfus/ml)/kp (10(7) cfus/ml)/pa (10(7) cfus/ml)/mrsa (10(5) cfus/ml) yielded a 100% osteomyelitis induction rate. at 8 weeks, however, only one mono-bacterial group and one multibacterial group showed significant radiographic improvement (p < 0.05). the rabbit model of osteomyelitis can be adapted to study infected blast wounds typical of those seen in veterans. to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the model simulating multibacterial infections with multidrug-resistant organisms.

TI  == wound healing potential of topical bacteriophage therapy on diabetic cutaneous wounds.
AB  == chronic wounds that fail to heal are a common complication of diabetes mellitus and the most common precipitating reason for nontraumatic lower limb amputation.  unfortunately, the bacterial species that cause these infections are becoming more resistant to antibiotics, making them increasingly difficult to treat. we assessed the feasibility of combating chronic bacterial infections with a topically delivered bacteriophage cocktail in two animal models of diabetes mellitus. microbiological, planimetric, and histological parameters were compared in debrided infected wounds with or without topical bacteriophage treatment. we determined that bacteriophage treatment effectively decreased bacterial colony counts and improved wound healing, as indicated by smaller epithelial and dermal  gaps, in staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa infections but was not  as effective against acinetobacter baumannii. although the improvements were more significant in the rodent model than in the porcine model, our results suggest that topically administered bacteriophage treatment may be effective in resolving chronic infections, especially when applied in conjunction with wound debridement. these findings have important implications for the feasibility of using topical antimicrobial therapies to safely treat chronic infections in diabetes mellitus patients.

TI  == impact of electronic surveillance on isolation practices.
AB  == objective: to assess the impact of an electronic surveillance system on isolation practices and rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). design: a pre-post test intervention. setting: inpatient units (except psychiatry and labor and delivery) in 4 new york city hospitals. patients: all patients for  whom isolation precautions were indicated, may 2009-december 2011. methods: trained observers assessed isolation sign postings, availability of isolation carts, and staff use of personal protective equipment (ppe). infection rates were obtained from the infection control department. regression analyses were used to  examine the association between the surveillance system, infection prevention practices, and mrsa infection rates. results: a total of 54,159 isolation days and 7,628 staff opportunities for donning ppe were observed over a 31-month period. odds of having an appropriate sign posted were significantly higher after intervention than before intervention (odds ratio [or], 1.10 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 1.01-1.20]). relative to baseline, postintervention sign posting improved significantly for airborne and droplet precautions but not for contact precautions. sign posting improved for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (or, 1.51 [95% ci, 1.23-1.86]; [formula: see text]), clostridium difficile (or, 1.59 [95% ci, 1.27-2.02]; [formula: see text]), and acinetobacter baumannii (or, 1.41 [95%  ci, 1.21-1.64]; [formula: see text]) precautions but not for mrsa precautions (or, 1.11 [95% ci, 0.89-1.39]; [formula: see text]). staff and visitor adherence  to ppe remained low throughout the study but improved from 29.1% to 37.0% after the intervention (or, 1.14 [95% ci, 1.01-1.29]). mrsa infection rates were not significantly different after the intervention. conclusions: an electronic surveillance system resulted in small but statistically significant improvements  in isolation practices but no reductions in infection rates over the short term.  such innovations likely require considerable uptake time.

TI  == evaluation of ambulance decontamination using gaseous chlorine dioxide.
AB  == objective: we evaluated gaseous chlorine dioxide (clo2) decontamination of an ambulance using a variety of bacterial biological agents. methods: spores of attenuated bacillus anthracis and bacillus atrophaeus as well as vegetative cells of acinetobacter baumannii, mycobacterium smegmatis, and staphylococcus aureus were exposed to clo2 gas inside an ambulance. log reduction in viability was assessed following decontamination using organism plate counts. results: ambulance decontamination with clo2 gas concentrations of 362 to 695 ppm maintained to exposures of 756 ppm-hours with 65% relative humidity (rh) achieved inactivation of all the bacterial agents tested. decreasing exposure (ppm-hours)  and rh (<65%) or restricting air flow reduced inactivation but still achieved greater than 6-log reductions in organism viability. conclusion: up to 10-log reductions were achieved in an ambulance interior following exposure to clo2, indicating that gas concentrations needed to mitigate biological agent contamination can be achieved and maintained safely in an ambulance. future studies are ongoing to evaluate gaseous clo2 in other environments contaminated with biological agents of health care concern.

TI  == previous antibiotic exposure and evolution of antibiotic resistance in mechanically ventilated patients with nosocomial infections.
AB  == purpose: this study aimed to evaluate the impact of previous antibiotic exposure  and the influence of time interval since exposure on the evolution of antibiotic-resistant infections. methods: we retrospectively analyzed 167 mechanically ventilated patients with nosocomial infections over a 3-year period, with focus on infections in the bloodstream, urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, and surgical sites. results: of 167 patients, 62% were confirmed as antibiotic resistant. the most common isolated pathogen was extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enterobacteriaceae (43.9%), followed by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (22.8%), and carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (17.5%). multivariate analysis revealed that the association between resistance and the time interval increased within 10 days (odds ratio [or], 2.45; p=.133) and peaked at 11 to 20 days (or, 7.17; p=.012). the data were categorized into 2  groups: when the time interval was more than 20 days, there was a 23.9% reduction in resistance rate compared with when the time interval was 20 days or less (or,  0.36; p=.002). conclusions: although antibiotic exposure increased resistance rate in nosocomial infections, this association decreased as time interval increased. antibiotic stewardship should consider the significance of time interval while investigating the evolution of subsequent antibiotic-resistant infections.

TI  == nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in cuban intensive care units: bacterial species and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == introduction: nosocomial pneumonia associated with use of mechanical ventilators  is one of the greatest challenges confronted by intensivists worldwide. the literature associates several bacteria with this type of infection; most common in intensive care units are acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and some of the enterobacteriaceae family. objectives: to identify the causal agents of nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care units of havana's hermanos ameijeiras clinical-surgical teaching hospital in 2011, and to characterize their antibiotic resistance. methods: a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using hospital administrative data of quantitative cultures from positive tracheal aspirates for january through december, 2011. records were analyzed from 77 intensive care unit patients who developed nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. variables examined were age and sex, and pathogens identified from culture of tracheal aspirate and related antibiotic susceptibility. results species most frequently isolated were: acinetobacter baumannii in 53 patients (68.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa in 34 patients (44.2%), other species of pseudomonas in 15 patients (19.5%), and serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli in  12 patients each (15.6%). some patients presented more than one pathogen in concurrent or successive infections. antimicrobial susceptibility testing found high percentages of resistance to antibiotics in all these pathogens. least resistance was found to colistin. conclusions: the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria causing nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia is of concern. colistin is the drug of choice among the antibiotics reviewed, but sensitivity to other antibiotics should be assessed to search for more appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics for treating nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. our results also suggest the need to strengthen  infection control efforts, particularly in intensive care units, and to reassess  compliance with quality control procedures. multidisciplinary research involving  microbiologists, epidemiologists, internists and intensivists is needed to fully  understand the etiological and resistance patterns observed.

TI  == antibiotic resistance rates in causative agents of infections in diabetic patients: rising concerns.
AB  == the vicious cycle is that hyperglycemia (>/=11.1 mmol/l) or other diabetes-associated factors facilitate or worsen the development of infections and vice versa, the infections deteriorate the glycemic control of the patients.  diabetic patients are prone to some infections, infection recurrences and poor outcomes. immunocompromised state and frequent antibiotic use are associated with antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis (in some studies), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, bacteria in diabetic foot infections and different opportunistic and rare pathogens or multidrug-resistant strains. prompt diagnostics and susceptibility testing, early and aggressive surgical and/or antibiotic therapy, and, importantly, good glycemic control are of utmost importance for treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in diabetic patients.

AB  == introduction: antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat in hospitalized patients, and inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is known to adversely affect outcomes in ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). the aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial usage, incidence, etiology, and antimicrobial resistance trends for prominent nosocomial pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in a clinical-surgical intensive care unit (icu). methods: gram-negative bacilli and staphylococcus aureus causing vap, as well as  their antimicrobial resistance patterns and data on consumption (defined daily dose [ddd] per 1,000 patient days) of glycopeptides, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and carbapenems in the unit were evaluated in two different periods (a and b). results: antimicrobial use was high, mainly of broad-spectrum  cephalosporins, with a significant increase in the consumption of glycopeptides (p < 0.0001) and carbapenems (p < 0.007) in period b. for acinetobacter baumannii and members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 5.27- and 3.06-fold increases in vaps, respectively, were noted, and a significant increase in resistance rates was found for imipenem-resistant a. baumannii (p = 0.003) and third-generation cephalosporins-resistant enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.01) isolates in this same period. conclusions: our results suggest that there is a link between antibiotics usage at institutional levels and resistant bacteria. the use of carbapenems was  related to the high rate of resistance in a. baumannii and therefore a high consumption of imipenem/meropenem could play a major role in selective pressure exerted by antibiotics in a. baumannii strains.

TI  == one-year surveillance of eskape pathogens in an intensive care unit of monterrey, mexico.
AB  == background: bacterial species from the eskape group (i.e. enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species) are frequently resistant to antibiotics. the purpose of this study was to monitor the incidence of eskape pathogens at the intensive care unit (icu) of a tertiary care hospital in monterrey, mexico. methods: all clinically relevant organisms isolated from june  2011 to june 2012 were included. identification and susceptibility testing was performed using panels from sensititre. resistance to oxacillin, for s. aureus, and the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), for k. pneumonia, were determined as defined by the clinical laboratory standards institute. also, the presence of vana and vanb genes was determined in e. faecium vancomycin (van)-resistant isolates. results: the majority of pathogens (64.5%) isolated in the icu unit were from the eskape group. the organisms most frequently isolated were a. baumannii (15.8%) and p. aeruginosa (14.3%). a high resistance to carbapenems was detected for a. baumannii (75.3%) while 62% of s. aureus isolates were confirmed to be methicillin resistant. of the k. pneumoniae  isolates, 36.9% were esbl producers. we detected three e. faecium van-resistant isolates, all of which contained the vana gene. conclusion: the presence of the eskape group of pathogens is a major problem in the icu setting. the results of this study support the implementation of special antimicrobial strategies to specifically target these microorganisms.

TI  == emerging threat of multidrug resistant bugs--acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: infections caused by bacteria such as multidrug resistant (mdr) acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) constitute a worldwide pandemic. without gathering information about these strains, we cannot reduce the morbidity and mortality due to infections caused by these notorious bugs. methods: this study was conducted to identify the status of mdr acinetobacter spp. and mrsa in a tertiary care centre of nepal. sputum, endotracheal aspirate and bronchial washing specimens were collected and processed from patients suspected of lower respiratory tract infection following  standard microbiological methods recommended by the american society for microbiology (asm). double disk synergy test method was employed for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) in acinetobacter isolates. methicillin resistance in s. aureus was confirmed by using cefoxitin and oxacillin disks. results: different genomespecies of acinetobacter were isolated; these consisted of acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and a. lwoffii.  around 95% of acinetobacter isolates were mdr, while 12.9% were esbl-producer. of the total 33 isolates of s. aureus, 26 (78.8%) were mdr and 14 (42.4%) were methicillin resistant. conclusions: a large number of mdr acinetobacter spp. and  mrsa has been noted in this study. the condition is worsened by the emergence of  esbl producing acinetobacter spp. hence, judicious use of antimicrobials is mandatory in clinical settings. moreover, there should be vigilant surveillance of resistant clones in laboratories.

TI  == emerging resistance problems and future perspectives in pharmacotherapy for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (utis) are among the most common infectious diseases and contribute to high financial burden worldwide. administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy is the key to achieving good therapeutic outcomes. the authors review the current status of global or regional epidemiology, especially on the antimicrobial resistance and several potential agents against complicated utis by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens. areas covered: the authors summarized the susceptibility status on several major surveillance programs on uropathogens, focusing on enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. besides, the current perspectives of several potential antimicrobials against mdr uropathogens available for utis were also reviewed. expert opinion: high resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially to extended-spectrum beta-lactams, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones among uropathogens emerges as a critical problem in many countries. appropriate antimicrobial stewardship and continuous surveillance are necessary to monitor the trends of susceptibility for main pathogens. for these mdr uropathogens, polymyxin, fosfomycin, tigecycline, nitrofurantoin, linezolid, and daptomycin might be potential treatments for patients with uncomplicated and complicated utis in some countries, although they might not be approved by their regulation. however, more clinical evidence and more extensive meta-analyses are needed to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of their usage in countries with a high prevalence of multidrug resistance.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus- the predominant pathogen in the neonatal icu of a tertiary care hospital in amritsar, india.
AB  == background: an early treatment and the appropriate and the rational use of antibiotics would minimize the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in neonatal sepsis, and reduce the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms in intensive care units. for the success of an early empiric treatment, a periodic review of the cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. aim: to study the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens which caused neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity patterns, so that guidelines could be prepared for a rational antibiotic therapy. setting and design: this was a retrospective study which was  conducted in the department of microbiology and the neonatal intensive care unit  (nicu) at sgrdimsar, amritsar, during june 2011 to june 2012. methods and materials: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 311 newborns who were admitted in an nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by doing standard biochemical tests. the antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates were studied by the kirby bauer disc diffusion technique. results: a total of 131 organisms were isolated from the 311 blood cultures. these included staphylococcus aureus (n=68), coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) (n=30), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=10), acinetobacter baumannii (n=9), escherichia coli (n=05), enterobacter cloacae (n=04), citrobacter diversus (n=02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=02) and candida (n=01). staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis.  on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 57.35% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to amikacin. the resistance to the third generation cephalosporins varied between 50-55%. the resistance to ciprofloxacin was quite high; however, most of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. a majority of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactum and imipenem. conclusion: the present study emphasized the importance of periodic surveys on the microbial flora which was encountered in particular neonatal settings to recognize the trend.

TI  == anti-inflammatory and anti-superbacterial activity of polyphenols isolated from black raspberry.
AB  == the fruit of the black raspberry (rubus coreanus miquel) has been employed in traditional medicine, and recent studies have demonstrated its measureable biological activities. however, the root of the black raspberry has not been studied. therefore, in this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties of the root and unripe fruit polyphenols of the black raspberry. both polyphenols proved to have anti-inflammatory activity as evidenced by the decreased nitric oxide (no), cytokines (il-1beta , il-6, and il-10) and prostaglandin e2 (pge(2)) levels in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated raw 264.7 murine macrophages. however, root polyphenols showed stronger anti-inflammatory activity than fruit polyphenols. lps-induced mrna and  protein expressions of inducible no synthase (inos) and cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 levels were also decreased, confirming the anti-inflammatory activity. root polyphenols showed lethal activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (crab), and bacillus  anthracis. in contrast, the black raspberry fruit did not demonstrate these properties. these data provide the first demonstration that black raspberry root  has potential anti-inflammatory and anti-superbacterial properties that can be exploited as alternatives for use in the food and cosmetic industries and/or as pharmaceuticals.

TI  == molecular viability testing of bacterial pathogens from a complex human sample matrix.
AB  == assays for bacterial ribosomal rna precursors (pre-rrna) have been shown to distinguish viable from inactivated bacterial cells in drinking water samples. because the synthesis of pre-rrna is rapidly induced by nutritional stimulation,  viable bacteria can be distinguished from inactivated cells and free nucleic acids by measuring the production of species-specific pre-rrna in samples that have been briefly stimulated with nutrients. here, pre-rrna analysis was applied  to bacteria from serum, a human sample matrix. in contrast to drinking water, serum is rich in nutrients that might be expected to mask the effects of nutritional stimulation. reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) assays were used to detect pre-rrna of four bacterial species: acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. these species were chosen for their clinical  significance and phylogenetic diversity (proteobacteria, firmicutes, and actinobacteria). to maximize resolving power, pre-rrna was normalized to genomic  dna of each pathogen. when viable cells were shifted from serum to bacteriological culture medium, rapid replenishment of pre-rrna was always observed. cells of p. aeruginosa that were inactivated in the presence of serum exhibited no pre-rrna response to nutritional stimulation, despite strong genomic dna signals in these samples. when semi-automated methods were used, pre-rrna analysis detected viable a. baumannii cells in serum at densities of </=100 cfu/ml in <5.5 hours. originally developed for rapid microbiological analysis of  drinking water, ratiometric pre-rrna analysis can also assess the viability of bacterial cells derived from human specimens, without requiring bacteriological culture.

(2) methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. detection rates of esbls in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) no obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of staphylococcus and enterococcus were observed during these years. the enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to carbapenems, next to cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam. but the resistance rates of escherichia coli to cefepime and ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems increased. conclusions: escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. the resistance rates of escherichia coli to cefepime  and ceftazidime, pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems were gradually increasing  in the past years.

TI  == epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance among commonly encountered bacteria associated with infections and colonization in intensive care units in a university-affiliated hospital in shanghai.
AB  == background/purpose: the aim of this study was to classify intensive care unit (icu) bacterial strains as either icu-acquired or icu-on-admission and to compare their epidemiological and antibiogram characteristics. methods: the study was performed in a 1300-bed university-affiliated hospital from january 1, 2006 to december 31, 2010. based on the time of icu admission, icu isolates were classified as icu-acquired strains (appearing more than 48 hours after admission) or icu-on-admission strains (appearing 48 hours or less from admission). the microbiological data before icu admission, the microbiological data, and susceptibility testing were compared between the icu-acquired and icu-on-admission bacterial isolates. results: the most common icu-acquired strains were acinetobacter baumannii (19.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (11.5%), staphylococcus aureus (10.7%), enterococcus spp. (10.6%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (9.7%). there were significant differences between icu-acquired and icu-on-admission isolates in the susceptibility rates of gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics, especially the susceptibility of a. baumannii to imipenem [23.8% (icu-acquired) vs. 44.4% (icu-on-admission), p < 0.001] and meropenem (24.1% vs. 37.8%, p < 0.001), and the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to imipenem (39.3% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001) and  meropenem (58.5% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.05). furthermore, decreased susceptibility rates of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa to carbapenems were correlated with an extended icu stay (p < 0.05). conclusion: because of decreasing susceptibility rates of pathogens (especially icu-acquired strains) and a significant correlation with the length of icu stay, intensivists should consider a patient's time of icu admission and previous microbiological data and should distinguish icu-acquired strains from non-icu-acquired strains so as to initiate optimized empirical antibiotic therapy against icu-acquired infections.

AB  == tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with activity against difficult-to-treat pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp., acinetobacter baumannii, and gram-negative bacterial strains that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. minimal organ toxicity and lack of dosage adjustment in most patients are important considerations for tigecycline use. tigecycline has been shown to be as effective and safe as standard antimicrobial therapy for treatment of adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. the clearest applications of tigecycline are for on-label indications. whether tigecycline should be utilized as therapy for other infections including hospital-acquired infections with a high likelihood of multidrug-resistant pathogens is a complex issue that requires ongoing assessment. this article offers an updated overview of tigecycline clinical studies, current microbial resistance patterns, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic investigations, and safety analyses.

TI  == biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  == background: biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. to date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both gram-positive and gram-negative multidrug-resistant (mdr) species in the context of numerous types of infectious  syndromes. herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. methods: the biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at brooke army medical center (bamc) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mrsa/mssa) (n=23), acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (sem). relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and mdr phenotype were evaluated. furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. results: of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with p. aeruginosa and s. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more  frequently observed to be mdr. in patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be  strong biofilm producers in vitro. conclusions: this study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues,  (3) mdr pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.

TI  == recent trends in resistance to cell envelope-active antibacterial agents among key bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cell envelope-active agents, particularly beta-lactams, play a pivotal role in the treatment of bacterial infections and the extent to which their activity is affected by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is of concern. we analyzed the surveillance network (tsn) database to evaluate resistant trends for key cell envelope-active drugs among eskape pathogens. analysis demonstrated that the activity of these drugs has been notably influenced by the emergence of multidrug resistance; this was especially evident for the beta-lactam drugs. for  example, acinetobacter baumannii resistance to imipenem increased from 23.9% to 34.3%, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 37.0% to 49.7% between 2007 and 2011. during the same time period klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to imipenem increased from 0.8% to 3.8%. as beta-lactams are a cornerstone of anti-infective therapy, it is important to closely monitor the activity of the agents being used today and to aggressively pursue new strategies that can augment current drugs and thwart ever-emerging beta-lactam resistance mechanisms that are continuously encountered.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == comparison of the bacterial etiology of early-onset and late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia in subjects enrolled in 2 large clinical studies.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is classified as early-onset or late-onset, in part, to identify subjects at risk for infection with resistant pathogens. we assessed differences in the bacterial etiology of early-onset versus late-onset vap. methods: subjects enrolled in 2004-2006 in 2 clinical studies of doripenem versus imipenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, with a diagnosis of vap (n = 500) were included in the analysis. subjects were classified by ventilator status: early-onset vap (< 5 d of ventilation) or late-onset vap (>/=  5 d of ventilation). baseline demographics and bacterial etiology were analyzed by vap status. results: late-onset vap subjects had higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache ii) scores (mean 16.6 versus 15.5, p = .008). there were no significant differences in clinical pulmonary infection score, sex, age, or presence of bacteremia between the groups. a total of 496 subjects had a  baseline pathogen, and 50% of subjects in each group had >/= 2 pathogens. with the exception of staphylococcus aureus, which was common in early-onset vap, the  pathogens (including potentially multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens) isolated from early-onset versus late-onset vap were not significantly different between groups. acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa with decreased susceptibility to any study drug was observed in early-onset and late-onset vap subjects. conclusions: there were no significant differences in the prevalence of potential mdr pathogens associated with early-onset or late-onset vap, even in subjects with prior antibiotics. empiric therapy for early-onset vap should also  include agents likely to be effective for potential mdr pathogens. further prospective studies should evaluate microbiology trends in subjects with vap.

TI  == three-year review of bacteriological profile and antibiogram of burn wound isolates in van, turkey.
AB  == the risk of infection in burns is well-known. in recent decades, the antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients has increased. for this reason, a retrospective study was conducted at van training and research hospital to analyze the bacterial isolates from the wounds of patients admitted to the burn unit and to determine the susceptibility patterns of the commonly cultured organisms over a 3-year period, january 2009 to december 2011.a total of 250 microorganisms were isolated from burn wounds of 179 patients. our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was acinetobacter baumannii (23.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), staphylococcus aureus (11.2%), escherichia coli (10%) respectively. multidrug-resistance has emerged as an important concern in our burn unit. tigecycline, and colistin were found to be the most active drugs against acinetobacter baumannii. carbapenems and amikacin, were found to be the most active drugs against other gram negative bacteria. vancomycin and linezolid  were active against gram positive bacteria.aggressive infection control measures  should be applied to limit the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == additional risk factors for infection by multidrug-resistant pathogens in healthcare-associated infection: a large cohort study.
AB  == background: there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of risk factors for healthcare-associated infection (hcai). the purpose of this study was to identify additional risk factors for hcai, which are not included in the current  definition of hcai, associated with infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens, in all hospitalized infected patients from the community. methods: this 1-year prospective cohort study included all patients with infection admitted to a large, tertiary care, university hospital. risk factors not included in the hcai definition, and independently associated with mdr pathogen infection, namely mdr gram-negative (mdr-gn) and eskape microorganisms (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella species, carbapenem-hydrolyzing klebsiella pneumonia and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter species), were identified by logistic regression among patients admitted from the community (either with community-acquired or hcai). results: there were 1035 patients with  infection, 718 from the community. of these, 439 (61%) had microbiologic documentation; 123 were mdr (28%). among mdr: 104 (85%) had mdr-gn and 41 (33%) had an eskape infection. independent risk factors associated with mdr and mdr-gn  infection were: age (adjusted odds ratio (or) = 1.7 and 1.5, p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively), and hospitalization in the previous year (between 4 and 12  months previously) (adjusted or = 2.0 and 1,7, p = 0.008 and p = 0.048, respectively). infection by pathogens from the eskape group was independently associated with previous antibiotic therapy (adjusted or = 7.2, p < 0.001) and a  karnofsky index <70 (adjusted or = 3.7, p = 0.003). patients with infection by mdr, mdr-gn and pathogens from the eskape group had significantly higher rates of inadequate antibiotic therapy than those without (46% vs 7%, 44% vs 10%, 61% vs 15%, respectively, p < 0.001). conclusions: this study suggests that the inclusion of additional risk factors in the current definition of hcai for mdr pathogen infection, namely age >60 years, karnofsky index <70, hospitalization in the previous year, and previous antibiotic therapy, may be clinically beneficial  for early diagnosis, which may decrease the rate of inadequate antibiotic therapy among these patients.

TI  == comparing the transmission potential of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii among inpatients using target environmental monitoring.
AB  == background: with the increasing isolation rate of multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mdr-ab) in china hospitals, more researches focused on its antimicrobial resistance, but few studies reported its nosocomial transmission. in this study, we aim to investigate the transmission features of mdr-ab among inpatients using target environmental monitoring. methods: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and mdr-ab active screening and target environmental screening were performed from march 2010 to october 2011 in respiratory intensive care unit (ricu). we compared bed linen contamination rate and acquisition rate of mdr-ab with those of mrsa and analyzed the correlation between weekly colonization pressure adjusted by degree of bed linen  contamination (wcpe) and weekly acquisition rate (war) of mdr-ab. results: we found that both the bed linen contamination rate and the acquisition rate of mdr-ab were higher than those of mrsa (chi(2) = 98.081, p < .01; chi(2) = 49.844, p < .01, respectively). the correlation analysis showed positive correlation between mdr-ab wcpe and war (rs = 0.560, p < .01). the wcpe and war of mdr-ab were higher than those of mrsa (z = -5.439, p < .01; z = -3.258, p < .01, respectively). conclusion: compared with mrsa, mdr-ab carriers showed stronger ability to contaminate their immediate environment, and mdr-ab was easier to transmit among inpatients. therefore, it was likely more important to perform active environmental monitoring as a method of transmission evaluation and a measure of routine infection control to prevent and control mdr-ab nosocomial transmission more effectively.

TI  == effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. ozone may have a role in these situations. the objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in petri dishes. methods: a pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. the small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/ml ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. in the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). the cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of o(3)/ml for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. results: the selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. all isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. conclusion: a single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == photoinactivation of gram positive and gram negative bacteria with the antimicrobial peptide (klaklak)(2) conjugated to the hydrophilic photosensitizer  eosin y.
AB  == we test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial peptide (klaklak)(2) enhances the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer eosin y upon conjugation. the conjugate eosin-(klaklak)(2) was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. photoinactivation assays were performed against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii aye, as well as the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus , and  staphylococcus epidermidis . partitioning assays were performed with e. coli and  s. aureus . photohemolysis and photokilling assays were also performed to assess  the photodynamic activity of the conjugate toward mammalian cells. eosin-(klaklak)(2) photoinactivates 99.999% of 10(8) cfu/ml of most bacteria tested at a concentration of 1 mum or below. in contrast, neither eosin y nor (klaklak)(2) cause any significant photoinactivation under similar conditions. the increase in photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer conferred by the antimicrobial peptide is in part due to the fact that (klaklak)(2) promotes the association of eosin y to bacteria. eosin-(klaklak)(2) does not significantly associate with red blood cells or the cultured mammalian cell lines hacat, cos-7, and colo 316. consequently, little photodamage or photokilling is observed with these cells under conditions for which bacterial photoinactivation is achieved. the peptide (klaklak)(2) therefore significantly enhances the photodynamic activity of eosin y toward both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria while interacting minimally with human cells. overall, our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides such as (klaklak)(2) might serve as attractive agents that can target photosensitizers to bacteria specifically.

AB  == immunocompromised hosts are at high risk for bloodstream infections (bsis); the outcome is unpredictable (even with adequate therapy), frequently severe (mortality 27%). a 26 months survey in a haematology/oncology hospital was set-up; it comprised 158 patients and detected 171 positive blood cultures. the origin of the infections was primitive in 27.22% and secondary in 72.78% of the cases; the most frequent cause was the presence of a vascular catheter (23.41%).  the second most important cause were the respiratory infections (19.62%), followed by the urinary tract infections (utis) (11.39%). gram negative bacilli represented 59.4%, the enterobacteriaceae were predominant (35.59%), followed by  pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.73%) and species like serratia marcescens and acinetobacter baumannii. although isolated at low level, they worry by an increasing frequency. among gram positive cocci (43.51%) coagulase negative staphylococci (cons) were the most frequent (25.42%), followed by staphylococcus  aureus (18.08%); enterococcus faecalis (5.65%) was isolated from polymicrobial (associated) infections. the strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa  were constantly susceptible to carbapenems, demonstrating otherwise various susceptibility patterns, generally elevated to the antibiotics we tested. the production of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl) was 22.58%. the methicillin  resistance was 54.4% in s. aureus strains; the susceptibility was variable among  7 other antibiotics tested. one staphylococcus strain had reduced susceptibility  to vancomycin. a multidisciplinary survey is necessary for the control of the multidrug resistant organisms (mdro).

TI  == antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acid exhibit potent bactericidal activity against eskape pathogens.
AB  == a series of 36 synthetic antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids  were screened to determine their effectiveness to treat enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pnemoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens, which are known to commonly infect chronic wounds. the primary amino acid sequences of these peptides incorporate either three or six dipeptide units consisting of the unnatural amino acids tetrahydroisoquinolinecarboxylic acid (tic) and octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (oic). the tic-oic dipeptide units are separated by spacer amino acids with specific physicochemical properties that control how these peptides interact with bacterial cell membranes of different chemical compositions. these peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against these pathogens in the range from >100 to 6.25 mug/ml. the observed diversity of mic values for these peptides against the various bacterial strains  are consistent with our hypothesis that the complementarity of the physicochemical properties of the peptide and the lipid of the bacteria's cell membrane determines the resulting antibacterial activity of the peptide.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == esculentin-2cha: a host-defense peptide with differential cytotoxicity against bacteria, erythrocytes and tumor cells.
AB  == the host-defense peptide, esculentin-2cha (gfssifrgva(10)kfaskglgk d(20)laklgvdlva(30) ckiskqc) shows potent (mic</=6 mum) growth inhibitory activity against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia  and differential cytotoxic activity against human erythrocytes (lc(50)=150 mum) and human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells (lc(50)=10 mum). esculentin-2cha significantly (p<0.01) stimulates the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 by mouse lymphoid cells and elevates its production after stimulation with concanavalin a and significantly (p<0.05) stimulates tnf-alpha production by peritoneal macrophages. effects on il-6 and il-1beta production were not significant. removal of the hydrophobic n-terminal hexapeptide (gfssif) from esculentin-2cha results in abolition of growth inhibitory activity against s. aureus and cytotoxic activity against erythrocytes and a549 cells as well as a marked (>/=16-fold) reduction in potency against a. baumannii and s. maltophilia. the primary structure of esculentin-2 has been poorly conserved between frog species but evolutionary pressure has acted to maintain the hydrophobic character of this n-terminal hexapeptide sequence. removal of the cyclic c-terminal domain (ckiskqc) and replacement of the cys(31)  and cys(37) residues by serine resulted in appreciable decreases in cytotoxicity  against all microorganisms and against mammalian cells. the more cationic [d20k,  d27k] analog showed a modest increase in potency against all microorganisms (up to 4-fold) but a marked increase in cytotoxicity against erythrocytes (lc(50)=11  mum) and a549 cells (lc(50)=3 mum).

TI  == biocidal activity of metalloacid-coated surfaces against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (moo3)  has been recently described. the metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (h3o+), which creates an acidic ph that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. we determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. methods: metalloacid-coated and non-coated  (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/ml. eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate mrsa mu50 strain and a st80-pvl-producing mrsa strain); a vancomycin-resistant vana enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains; a mbl-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant acinetobacter  baumannii strain; a toxin-producing clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus). the assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. results: against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. conclusions: we suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.

TI  == verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential pcr gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  == aims: to verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (late-pcr) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., klebsiella sp., acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus,  enterobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus sp., candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. methods and results: clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the university of california, davis medical center (ucdmc) microbiology laboratory. five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. dna extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), ac. baumannii (57%) and ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). all clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two ac. baumannii, two klebsiella oxytoca and two candida parapsilosis isolates. conclusions: sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex late-pcr assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. the multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with dna extracted from 70 different target strains. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the potential of late-pcr to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.

TI  == management and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens  is a leading healthcare-associated infection in mechanically ventilated patients. the incidence of vap due to mdr pathogens has increased significantly in the last decade. risk factors for vap due to mdr organisms include advanced age, immunosuppression, broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, increased severity of illness, previous hospitalization or residence in a chronic care facility and prolonged duration of invasive mechanical ventilation. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and several different species of gram-negative bacteria can cause mdr vap. especially difficult gram-negative bacteria include pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenemase-producing enterobacteraciae and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacteria. proper management includes selecting appropriate antibiotics, optimizing dosing and using timely de-escalation based on antiimicrobial sensitivity data. evidence-based strategies to prevent vap that incorporate multidisciplinary staff education and collaboration are essential to reduce the burden of this disease and associated healthcare costs.

TI  == adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  == adenylate kinase (ak) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. we have shown that ak release serves as  a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. the ak assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using  conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (scv) and bacteria within  established biofilms. the usefulness of the ak assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including escherichia coli and all members of the "eskape" pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). the assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited ak release. four of these  were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. two of these molecules were further characterized. the antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against s. aureus planktonic, scv population, and biofilm-associated cells. tamoxifen, an estrogen  receptor antagonist, was active toward e. faecium in vitro and also reduced e. faecium pathogenesis in a galleria mellonella infection model. our data demonstrate that the ak assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.

AB  == a library of 4,5-disubstituted 2-aminoimidazole triazole amide (2-aita) conjugates has been successfully assembled. upon biological screening, this class of small molecules was discovered as enhanced biofilm regulators through non-microbicidal mechanisms against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mdrab), with active concentrations in the low micromolar range. the library was also subjected to synergism and resensitization studies with beta-lactam antibiotics against mrsa.  lead compounds were identified that suppress the antibiotic resistance of mrsa by working synergistically with oxacillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic resistant to penicillinase. a further structure-activity relationship (sar) study on the parent 2-aita compound delivered a 2-aminoimidazole diamide (2-aida) conjugate with significantly increased synergistic activity with oxacillin against mrsa, decreasing the mic value of the beta-lactam antibiotic by 64-fold. increased anti-biofilm activity did not necessarily lead to increased suppression of antibiotic resistance, which indicates that biofilm inhibition and resensitization are most likely occurring via distinct mechanisms.

AB  == in combination antimicrobial therapy, the desired outcome is to broaden the antimicrobial spectrum and to achieve a possible synergistic effect. however, adverse antagonistic species may also emerge from such combinations, leading to treatment failure with serious consequences. it is therefore imperative to screen the drug candidates for compatibility and possible antagonistic interactions. the aim of this work was to develop a novel synergistic dry powder inhaler (dpi) formulation for antimicrobial combination therapy via the pulmonary route. binary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and gatifloxacin hydrochloride, sd-cip/gat) and ternary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, gatifloxacin hydrochloride, and lysozyme, sd-cip/gat/lys) combinations were prepared via spray-drying on a buchi(r) nano spray dryer b-90. the powder morphologies were spherical with a slightly corrugated surface and all within the respirable size range. the powders yielded  fine particle fractions (of the loaded dose) of over 40% when dispersed using an  aerolizer(r) at 60 l/min. time-kill studies carried out against the respiratory tract infection-causing bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumonia, and acinetobacter baumannii at 1 x the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) over 24h revealed no antagonistic behavior for both the binary and ternary combinations. while the interactions were generally found to be indifferent, a favorable synergistic effect was detected in the dual combination (sd-cip/gat) when it was tested against p. aeruginosa bacteria.

TI  == associations between bacterial contamination of health care workers' hands and contamination of white coats and scrubs.
AB  == background: uniforms are potential reservoirs for hospital organisms, potentially reinfecting the hands of health care workers (hcws). the study aimed to determine the association between the bacterial contamination of hcws' hands and uniforms (white coats and scrubs). methods: hcws working in 5 intensive care units had cultures obtained from their hands and uniforms (white coats or scrubs). pathogens were defined as any gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci. results: bacterial growth was detected on 103 hands (86%); 13 (11%)  grew s aureus, 7 (6%) grew acinetobacter spp, 2 (2%) grew enterococci, and 83 (70%) grew only skin flora. the presence of pathogens on the hands was associated with a greater likelihood of the presence of pathogens on white coats (kappa = 0.81; p < .001), but not on scrubs (kappa = 0.31; p = .036). similarly, the presence of acinetobacter on hcws' hands was associated with a greater likelihood of acinetobacter contamination of white coats (kappa = 0.70; p < .001), but not of scrubs (kappa = 0.36; p = .024). conclusions: contamination of provider's hands with pathogens or acinetobacter baumannii was associated with contamination of white coats. this association was not observed between hands and scrubs, however.

TI  == in vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual agents of catheter-related bloodstream infections.
AB  == objectives: catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsis) are common healthcare-associated infections associated with increased morbidity and medical  costs. antiseptic- and antibiotic-coated central venous catheters (cvcs) have been proposed to reduce the incidence of crbsis, with variable success. the aim of this study was to determine the in vivo antibiofilm activity of biocompatible  and inexpensive compounds, such as cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin, against usual agents of crbsis. methods: the antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin was tested against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans  in a mouse foreign body infection model, using polyurethane catheter segments. biofilm formation was assessed with a crystal violet assay to quantify the total  biomass, with a tetrazolium reduction assay to quantify the metabolic activity and with scanning electron microscopy. results: at subinhibitory concentrations,  cerium nitrate significantly reduced biofilm formation by c. albicans, chitosan significantly decreased biofilm formation by s. epidermidis and c. albicans, and  hamamelitannin significantly inhibited all bacterial biofilms. discussion: the in vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate against c. albicans and of chitosan against c. albicans and s. epidermidis, at subinhibitory concentrations, makes them promising alternatives to coat cvcs. moreover, the microbicidal effect on a  wider range of cvc colonizers was previously reported in vitro for both compounds, at higher concentrations. for all bacterial strains, the highest in vivo antibiofilm efficacy was achieved with hamamelitannin. for a. baumannii, this is the first report of in vivo inhibition.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance of the most frequently isolated microorganisms in the hospital general la mancha centro between june 2009 and may 2010].
AB  == introduction: during the last two decades an increased incidence of infections caused by multiresistant bacteria has been observed. the spread of these microorganisms in the hospital is a major therapeutic and epidemiological problem. the aim of this study was to determine local resistance patterns of microorganisms causative of multirresistant infections in patients admitted to our hospital. methods: a retrospective study was designed, including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from clinical and surveillance samples of patients admitted to the hospital general la mancha centro, between june 2009 and may 2010. results: the rate of s. aureus isolates resistant to oxacillin was 50%, with 0% resistance to vancomycin. the percentage  of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins in e. coli and k. pneumoniae was 17 and 19%, respectively; the esbl-production in enterobacterial strains was 15 and 19%, respectively, and the quinolone resistance was 41 and 28%, respectively. the resistance of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem was 30 and 40%, respectively. most strains of a. baumannii studied came from a single multidrug-resistant clone, endemic in the icu of our hospital. conclusions: of particular concern is the high rate of mrsa, e. coli and k. pneumoniae esbl producers and resistant to fluoroquinolones as well as p. aeruginosa multiresistant. a. baumannii isolates belong mainly to endemic multidrug-resistant clone from the icu.

TI  == the effect of d-amino acid substitution on the selectivity of temporin l towards  target cells: identification of a potent anti-candida peptide.
AB  == the frog skin peptide temporin l (tl, 13-residues long) has a wide and potent spectrum of antimicrobial activity, but it is also toxic on mammalian cells at its microbicidal concentrations. previous studies have indicated that its analogue [pro(3)]tl has a slightly reduced hemolytic activity and a stable helical conformation along residues 6-13. here, to expand our knowledge on the relationship between the extent/position of alpha-helix in tl and its biological  activities, we systematically replaced single amino acids within the alpha-helical domain of [pro(3)]tl with the corresponding d isomers, known as helix breakers. structure-activity relationship studies of these analogues, by means of cd and nmr spectroscopy analyses as well as antimicrobial and hemolytic  assays were performed. besides increasing our understanding on the structural elements that are responsible for cell selectivity of tl, this study revealed that a single l to d amino acid substitution can preserve strong anti-candida activity of [pro(3)]tl, without giving a toxic effect towards human cells.

TI  == surveillance on secular trends of incidence and mortality for device-associated infection in the intensive care unit setting at a tertiary medical center in taiwan, 2000-2008: a retrospective observational study.
AB  == background: device-associated infection (dai) plays an important part in nosocomial infection. active surveillance and infection control are needed to disclose the specific situation in each hospital and to cope with this problem effectively. we examined the rates of dai by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and 30-day and in-hospital mortality in the intensive care unit (icu). methods: prospective surveillance was conducted in a mixed medical and surgical icu at a major teaching hospital from 2000 through 2008. trend analysis was performed and  logistic regression was used to assess prognostic factors of mortality. results:  the overall rate of dais was 3.03 episodes per 1000 device-days. the most common  dai type was catheter-associated urinary tract infection (3.76 per 1000 urinary catheter-days). there was a decrease in dai rates in 2005 and rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap, 3.18 per 1000 ventilator-days) have remained low since then (p < 0.001). the crude rates of 30-day (33.6%) and in-hospital (52.3%) mortality, as well as infection by antibiotic-resistant vap pathogens also decreased. the most common antimicrobial-resistant pathogens were  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (94.9%) and imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (p < 0.001), which also increased at the most rapid rate. the rate of antimicrobial resistance among enterobacteriaceae also increased significantly (p < 0.05). after controlling for potentially confounding factors,  the dai was an independent prognostic factor for both 30-day mortality (or 2.51,  95% confidence interval [ci] 1.99-3.17, p = 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (or  3.61, 95% ci 2.10-3.25, p < 0.001). conclusions: the decrease in the rate of dai  and infection by resistant bacteria on the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome can be attributed to active infection control and improved adherence after 2003.

TI  == national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) funding for studies  of hospital-associated bacterial pathogens: are funds proportionate to burden of  disease?
AB  == background: hospital-associated infections (hais) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. the pathogens that cause the majority of serious hais are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, referred as esckape. we aimed to determine the amount of funding the national institute of health (nih) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly  esckape pathogens. methods: the nih research portfolio online reporting tools (report) database was used to identify niaid antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." results: funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. the total funding for all eskcape pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. s. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in fy2009, the highest funding amount of all the esckape pathogens. based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per s. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per c. difficile related death. conclusions: although the funding for esckape pathogens  has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.

TI  == prevention and treatment of virulent bacterial biofilms with an enzymatic nitric  oxide-releasing dressing.
AB  == the use of percutaneous medical devices often results in nosocomial infections. attachment of microorganisms to the surfaces of these medical devices triggers biofilm formation, which presents significant complications to the health of a patient and may lead to septicemia, thromboembolism, or endocarditis if not correctly treated. although several antimicrobials are commonly used for prevention of biofilm formation, they have limited efficacy against formed biofilms. in this study, we report the use of an enzymatic, gaseous nitric oxide  (gno)-releasing dressing for the prevention and treatment of acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. results show that the bactericidal activity against biofilms of the test strains was dependent on time and rate of gno release from the dressing. following 6 h of treatment, gno-releasing dressings significantly inhibited the growth of test strains relative to vehicle control dressings, demonstrating eradication of bacterial concentrations of up to 10(5) cfu/cm(2). complete cell death was observed for both prevention of biofilm formation and treatment of 24-h-grown biofilms after 6 h of treatment with the gno-releasing dressings. further, gno-releasing dressings were more efficient against formed biofilms than other antimicrobial agents currently used. these results demonstrate that the gno-releasing dressing can produce sufficient levels of gno  over a therapeutically relevant duration for maximal bactericidal effects against virulent bacterial strains known to cause nosocomial infections.

TI  == microbiologic characteristics of pathogenic bacteria from hospitalized trauma patients who survived wenchuan earthquake.
AB  == the purpose of this study is to investigate the microbiological characterization  of pathogenic bacteria isolated from trauma patients after wenchuan earthquake in 2008. most infections were identified in the patients over 60 years of age, with  an incidence rate of 78.5%, and more infections in wound (43.3%) and respiratory  tract (37.1%) sites were identified. a total of 97 non-duplicated clinical pathogens were isolated from 91 trauma patients. of those pathogens, 62 (63.9%) were gram-negative bacilli, 23 (23.7%) were gram-positive cocci, 9 (9.3%) were fungi, and 3 (3.1%) were anaerobes, such as clostridium perfringens. the distribution spectrum of pathogens isolated from trauma patients after earthquake was different to that from non-earthquake trauma patients in our hospital at the  same time. the most prevalent pathogenic isolates were escherichia coli (15.4%),  acinetobacter baumannii (14.4%), staphylococcus aureus (12.3%), burkholderia cepacia (11.3%), and enterococcus spp. (9.3%). the drug susceptibility results showed that most of the gram-negative bacilli, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa  and burkholderia cepacia, were susceptible to imipenem, but resistant to the first- and the second-generation cephalosporins. most of the gram-positive cocci  were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and synercid/dalfopristin. characteristics of pathogenic bacterium isolated from trauma patients after earthquake have been demonstrated which play an important role in the appropriate treatment of infections.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the potential for resistance development to ceragenin csa-13.
AB  == objectives: though most bacteria remain susceptible to endogenous antimicrobial peptides, specific resistance mechanisms are known. as mimics of antimicrobial peptides, ceragenins were expected to retain antibacterial activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, even after prolonged exposure. serial passaging of bacteria to a lead ceragenin, csa-13, was performed with representative pathogenic bacteria. ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and colistin were used as comparators. the mechanisms of resistance in gram-negative bacteria were  elucidated. methods: susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were serially exposed to csa-13 and comparators for 30 passages. mic values were monitored. alterations in the gram-negative bacterial membrane composition were characterized via mass spectrometry and the susceptibility of antimicrobial-peptide-resistant mutants to csa-13 was evaluated. results: s. aureus became highly resistant to ciprofloxacin after <20 passages. after 30 passages, the mic values of vancomycin and csa-13 for s. aureus increased 9- and 3-fold, respectively. the gram-negative organisms  became highly resistant to ciprofloxacin after <20 passages. mic values of colistin for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii increased to >/=100 mg/l after 20 passages. mic values of csa-13 increased to approximately 20-30 mg/l and plateaued over the course of the experiment. bacteria resistant to csa-13 displayed lipid a modifications that are found in organisms resistant to antimicrobial peptides. conclusions: csa-13 retained potent antibacterial activity against s. aureus over the course of 30 serial passages. resistance generated in gram-negative bacteria correlates with modifications to the outer membranes of these organisms and was not stable outside of the presence of the antimicrobial.

TI  == reducing the spread of acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus on a burns unit through the intervention of an infection control bundle.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii are major nosocomial pathogens in burns units. we investigated the impact of an infection control bundle on the incidence of nosocomial mrsa and a. baumannii in  our burns unit, comparing a pre-intervention period (december 2006-august 2008) with an intervention period (september 2008-december 2009). the bundle comprised  regular hydrogen peroxide vapour (hpv) disinfection of the rooms following discharge of patients colonized or infected by multidrug-resistant bacteria, pre-emptive cohort isolation of newly admitted patients before being proven culture negative, cohorting of colonized or infected patients, installation of two air disinfection systems in the corridors of the unit and improvement of material storage. we also investigated the microbiological efficacy of hpv disinfection by sampling the environment before and after hpv treatments. hpv disinfection eliminated pathogens from the environment and significantly reduced  total bacterial surface counts, and total fungal air and surface counts, on both  a unit and room scale. the incidence of nosocomial mrsa infection or colonization fell by 89.3% from 7.22 to 0.77 cases/1000 patient days (p<0.0001) and a. baumannii fell by 88.8% from 6.92 to 0.77 cases/1000 patient days (p=0.002) in the intervention period with no further outbreaks of these organisms occurring in this period. the infection control bundle resulted in a significant reduction in  the incidence of nosocomial mrsa and a. baumannii in our burns unit and prevented further outbreaks of these organisms.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == urpd: a specific product primer design tool.
AB  == background: polymerase chain reaction (pcr) plays an important role in molecular  biology. primer design fundamentally determines its results. here, we present a currently available software that is not located in analyzing large sequence but  used for a rather straight-forward way of visualizing the primer design process for infrequent users. findings: urpd (your primer design), a web-based specific product primer design tool, combines the ncbi reference sequences (refseq), ucsc  in-silico pcr, memetic algorithm (ma) and genetic algorithm (ga) primer design methods to obtain specific primer sets. a friendly user interface is accomplished by built-in parameter settings. the incorporated smooth pipeline operations effectively guide both occasional and advanced users. urpd contains an automated  process, which produces feasible primer pairs that satisfy the specific needs of  the experimental design with practical pcr amplifications. visual virtual gel electrophoresis and in silico pcr provide a simulated pcr environment. the comparison of practical gel electrophoresis comparison to virtual gel electrophoresis facilitates and verifies the pcr experiment. wet-laboratory validation proved that the system provides feasible primers. conclusions: urpd is a user-friendly tool that provides specific primer design results. the pipeline design path makes it easy to operate for beginners. urpd also provides a high throughput primer design function. moreover, the advanced parameter settings assist sophisticated researchers in performing experiential pcr. several novel functions, such as a nucleotide accession number template sequence input, local and global specificity estimation, primer pair redesign, user-interactive sequence scale selection, and virtual and practical pcr gel electrophoresis discrepancies have been developed and integrated into urpd. the urpd program is implemented in java and freely available at http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/urpd/.

TI  == bacterial yield from quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with pneumonia on antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == background/aims: early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial choice are crucial when managing pneumonia patients, and quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid is considered a useful method for identifying pneumonia pathogens. we evaluated the quantitative yield of bal fluid bacterial cultures in patients being treated with antimicrobials and attempted to identify factors predictive of positive bal cultures. methods: patients over 18 years old and whose bal fluid was subjected to quantitative culture to identify the organism causative of pneumonia between january 1, 2005, and december 31, 2009, were included. we reviewed the results of bal fluid bacterial cultures and the clinical records, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings of the patients. results: bal was performed on 340 patients with pneumonia. a positive bal culture, defined as isolation of more than 10(4) colony forming units/ml bacteria, was documented in 18 (5.29%) patients. of these, 9 bacteria isolated from 10 patients were classified as probable pathogens. the most frequently isolated bacteria were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. no independent predictive factor for positive bal cultures was identified. conclusions: the yield of quantitative bal  fluid bacterial culture in patients already on antimicrobials was low. clinicians should be cautious when performing a bal culture in patients with pneumonia who are already on antimicrobials.

TI  == costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  == objective: we compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. methods: a retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in manhattan. the main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. results: controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [ci], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; ci, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; ci, 1.5-5.4). patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; ci, 0.01-0.08). conclusions: with careful  matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. the difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.

TI  == multidrug-resistant organisms, wounds and topical antimicrobial protection.
AB  == multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) are increasingly implicated in both acute and chronic wound infections. the limited therapeutic options are further compromised by the fact that wound bacteria often co-exist within a biofilm community which enhances bacterial tolerance to antibiotics. as a consequence, topical antiseptics may be an important consideration for minimising the opportunity for wound infections involving mdros. the objective of this research  was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of a silver-containing gelling fibre dressing against a variety of mdros in free-living and biofilm states, using stringent in vitro models designed to simulate a variety of wound conditions. mdros included acinetobacter baumannii, community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. clostridium difficile was also included in the study because it carries many of the characteristics seen in mdros and evidence of multidrug resistance is emerging. sustained in vitro antimicrobial activity of the silver-containing dressing was shown against 10 mdros in a simulated wound fluid over 7 days, and inhibitory and bactericidal effects against both free-living and biofilm phenotypes were also consistently shown in simulated colonised wound surface models. the in vitro data support consideration of the silver-containing gelling fibre dressing as part of a protocol of care in the management of wounds colonised or infected with mdros.

TI  == bacterial contamination of the hospital environment during wound dressing change.
AB  == introduction: the hospital environment plays a role in the cross-transmission of  multidrug-resistant bacteria. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacterial contamination of the hospital environment during chronic wound dressing change. patients and methods: this study was performed from july 2010 to may 2011. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacteriaceae were counted in environmental samples (air and surfaces) that  were obtained in the rooms of patients with wounds colonized (cases, n=9) or not  (controls, n=15) during or not during wound dressing change. bacterial contamination was compared to that found in the rooms of patients without colonized wounds. results: the environment was frequently contaminated during wound dressing change (38% of the sampled series were positive). in comparison, the contamination was less frequent in the environment of patients with colonized wounds when the wounds were not being dressed (14.3%) and in controls (3.8%). s.  aureus was the most frequent species identified in positive samples. discussion:  these results suggest that previously recommended measures such as hand hygiene after contact with the environment and wearing a mask are justified. moreover, other measures should be suggested, in particular cleaning the room before and after dressing change of colonized wounds. level of evidence: level iii: case control study.

TI  == macrophage killing of bacterial and fungal pathogens is not inhibited by intense  intracellular accumulation of the lipoglycopeptide antibiotic oritavancin.
AB  == intact phagocytic effector function is fundamental to host defense against microbial pathogens. concern has been raised regarding the potential that accumulation of certain agents, including cationic amphiphilic antibiotics, within macrophages could cause a mixed-lipid storage disorder, resulting in macrophage dysfunction in recipients. the ability of 2 macrophage cell lines (hl-60; raw 264.7) to kill archetypal gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative (acinetobacter baumannii), and fungal (candida albicans) pathogens  was tested following exposure of the macrophages to the lipoglycopeptide antibiotic oritavancin. oritavancin did not affect killing of c. albicans but markedly enhanced killing of s. aureus by both macrophages. oritavancin modestly  reduced killing of a. baumannii by hl-60 cells but not by raw 264.7 cells. thus,  macrophage killing of microbes remains intact despite substantial intracellular accumulation with a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic.

TI  == biofilms on environmental surfaces: evaluation of the disinfection efficacy of a  novel steam vapor system.
AB  == background: environmental surfaces in health care settings are often contaminated by microorganisms, and biofilms can develop on the surfaces in these settings. steam vapor technology is of potential use for disinfection of biofilms on the environmental surfaces. methods: we tested the disinfection efficacy of a thermal-accelerated nanocrystal sanitation (tancs)-equipped steam vapor technology against biofilms through disinfecting biofilms developed by 4 bacterial strains-escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus-on an identical test surface (ie, polycarbonate) and biofilms developed by e coli on 4 different test surfaces: polycarbonate, rubber, stainless steel, and ceramics. results: our data show that a 3-second steam treatment rapidly killed each biofilm tested (>99.95 % killing efficiency). for biofilms developed on different surfaces, 3-second steam treatment achieved 99.95% killing of e coli biofilms developed on different surfaces. compared with chemical disinfection, steam treatment for <1 second a similar level of biofilm disinfection as provided by incubation with 10-ppm sodium hypochlorite (bleach) for 10-20 minutes of contact time. conclusions: our  data suggest that the tancs-equipped steam vapor disinfection is an emerging and  potentially useful technology for disinfecting biofilms on environmental surfaces.

TI  == [development status of new antibacterials].
AB  == the increase of the infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria is a serious problem worldwide. as for gram-positive bacteria, the community-acquired  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin- or linezolid-resistant strains have been increasing. as for gram-negative bacteria,  multi-drug-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii have been increasing due to the carbapenemase production  recently. during these 10 years, various types of novel antibacterials targeted for gram-positive bacteria have been approved in us and eu, but not in japan. on  the other hand, the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for gram-negative bacteria is still immature. in this review, the status of the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for these multi-drug-resistant bacteria will be reviewed.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by eskape organisms: cause, clinical features, and management.
AB  == purpose of review: despite important geographical variations, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) episodes. their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on icu patients' outcome. this review updates information on vap due to eskape pathogens. recent findings: although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus vap may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. local  colonization determines treatment options. the contribution of tracheobronchitis  is an important issue. minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for  nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria vap to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by eskape pathogens. summary: vap due to eskape pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.

TI  == porphyrin-cellulose nanocrystals: a photobactericidal material that exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial activity.
AB  == towards our overall objectives of developing potent antimicrobial materials to combat the escalating threat to human health posed by the transmission of surface-adhering pathogenic bacteria, we have investigated the photobactericidal  activity of cellulose nanocrystals that have been modified with a porphyrin-derived photosensitizer (ps). the ability of these previously synthesized porphyrin-cellulose-nanocrystals (cnc-por (1)) to mediate bacterial photodynamic inactivation was investigated as a function of bacterial strain, incubation time and illumination time. despite forming an insoluble suspension, cnc-por (1) showed excellent efficacy toward the photodynamic inactivation of acinetobacter baumannii, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mdrab) and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), with the best results achieving 5-6 log units reduction in colony forming units (cfus) upon illumination with visible light (400-700 nm; 118 j cm(-2)). cnc-por (1) mediated  the inactivation of pseudomonas aeruginosa, although at reduced activity (2-3 log units reduction). confocal laser scanning microscopy of cnc-por (1) after incubation with a. baumannii or s. aureus suggested a lack of internalization of  the ps. research into alternative materials such as cnc-por (1) may lead to their application in hospitals and healthcare-related industries wherein novel materials with the capability of reducing the rates of transmission of a wide range of bacteria, particularly antibiotic resistant strains, are desired.

TI  == [investigation and analysis of nosocomial infection in neonates].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence of nosocomial infections of newborn infants in neonates and to explore the risk factors and strategies of infection control. methods: there were 433 confirmed cases of nosocomial infection in the neonatal ward of the authors' hospital from january 2007 to december 2009. their  data of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, results of etiological examinations and antibiotic resistance were retrospectively analyzed. results: during the study, the number of hospitalizations were 6437. nosocomial infection  occurred in 433 patients 513 times. the overall nosocomial infection rate was 6.82%. the overall hospitalization days were 73 663 and nosocomial infection patient-day rates were 6.96 per thousand. the vap infection rate was 28.7 per thousand. the crbsi rate was 3.5 per thousand. gestational age (or = 1.049), mechanical ventilation (or = 1.810), umbilical vein catheter (or = 1.106), hospitalization days (or = 1.081), premature rupture of membrane (or = 1.433) were the risk factors for the development of nosocomial infection. there were 197 (38.4%) cases of pneumonia, which was the most common nosocomial infection in neonatal ward. there were 129 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap), which accounts for 65.5% of pneumonia and 24.4% of cases treated with ventilator. the next was sepsis, 124 cases (24.2%) and 64 cases of diarrheal disease (12.7%). one hundred and eighty two (54.4%) strains of isolates were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. the predominant pathogens of gram-negative bacteria were klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (8.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.2%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.8%) and escherichia coli (4.8%). the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 91.4% and 75%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to cephalosporins. the rate of resistance to imipenem of klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1.5%, 11.1% and 41.7%. the isolation rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus were 28.6% and 95.5%. conclusion: it is important to identify the high risk factors for nosocomial infections in newborn infants. to shorten time for mechanical ventilation and hospitalization days, removal of the central venous catheter as early as possible would be conducive to reducing the morbidity of nosocomial infection. the main pathogens were gram-negative bacteria. the multidrug resistance of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters is serious.

TI  == cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin as novel biofilm inhibitors?
AB  == objectives: the colonization of indwelling medical devices and subsequent biofilm formation represents a global challenge since it promotes the persistence of infection and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. the aim of this study was  to determine the antimicrobial activity of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual microbial colonizers and to assess their efficacy regarding biofilm formation on polyurethane (pur)-like catheters. methods: the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effect of cerium nitrate, low molecular weight chitosan (lmwc) and hamamelitannin was tested against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans strains. biofilm formation was assessed with pur-like catheter segments and the metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. results: cerium nitrate and lmwc inhibited the microbial growth of all microbial strains tested;  hamamelitannin showed no inhibition. regarding biofilm formation on pur-like catheters, with subinhibitory concentrations: cerium nitrate significantly inhibited the metabolic activity of c. albicans; lmwc reduced the metabolic activity of s. epidermidis and c. albicans; and hamamelitannin decreased the metabolic activity of all tested bacteria, but not of yeasts. conclusions: the microbicidal activity of cerium nitrate and lmwc was clearly demonstrated in this study, as was their fungistatic effect at lower concentrations. hamamelitannin significantly reduced biofilm metabolic activity of all tested bacteria. these microbial inhibitors may play a promising role regarding different biomedical applications.

TI  == efficacy, efficiency and safety aspects of hydrogen peroxide vapour and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide room disinfection systems.
AB  == background: this was a head-to-head comparison of two hydrogen-peroxide-based room decontamination systems. aim: to compare the efficacy, efficiency and safety of hydrogen peroxide vapour (hpv; clarus r, bioquell, andover, u.k.) and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (ahp; sr2, sterinis, now supplied as glosair, advanced sterilization products (asp), johnson & johnson medical ltd, wokingham,  u.k.) room disinfection systems. method: efficacy was tested using 4- and 6-log geobacillus stearothermophilus biological indicators (bis) and in-house prepared  test discs containing approximately 10(6) meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), clostridium difficile and acinetobacter baumannii. safety was assessed by detecting leakage of hydrogen peroxide using a hand-held detector. efficiency was assessed by measuring the level of hydrogen peroxide using a hand-held sensor at three locations inside the room, 2 h after the start of the cycles. findings: hpv generally achieved a 6-log reduction, whereas ahp generally achieved less than a 4-log reduction on the bis and in-house prepared test discs. uneven distribution was evident for the ahp system but not the hpv system. hydrogen peroxide leakage during ahp cycles with the door unsealed, as per the manufacturer's operating manual, exceeded the short-term exposure limit (2 ppm) for more than 2 h. when the door was sealed with tape, as per the hpv system, hydrogen peroxide leakage was <1 ppm for both systems. the mean concentration of  hydrogen peroxide in the room 2 h after the cycle started was 1.3 [standard deviation (sd) 0.4] ppm and 2.8 (sd 0.8) ppm for the four hpv and ahp cycles, respectively. none of the readings were <2 ppm for the ahp cycles. conclusion: the hpv system was safer, faster and more effective for biological inactivation.

TI  == garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  == when thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. as the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. in the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (allium sativum). wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (garo) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. garo prevented biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within enterococcus faecalis biofilms. additionally, garo disrupted partially developed  biofilms produced by s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii. the antistaphylococcal activity of garo was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. thus, garo could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound  biofilms caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.

TI  == repeat 2-stage exchange for infected total hip arthroplasty: a viable option?
AB  == we investigated whether performing a repeat 2-stage exchange eradicates infection in patients who previously underwent 2-stage treatment for an infected total hip  arthroplasty. we identified 15 patients who had failed a 2-stage total hip arthroplasty and underwent a planned repeat 2-stage between 2000 and 2009. of the 15 patients, 8 were treated with a complete 2-stage procedure, whereas the remaining 7 patients were treated only with a first-stage resection of the infected implant. of the 8 patients who underwent complete 2-stage exchange, 1 died because of in-hospital complications, and 1 had a recurrent infection. repeat infection is highly associated with resistant organisms, obesity, and poor patient health. of the 7 patients who underwent resection without reimplantation, 3 had a recurrent infection. our data suggest that if infection can be adequately controlled after repeat resection of the joint prosthesis, reimplantation is a reasonable option.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production by constituents from hypericum spp.
AB  == biofilm embedded bacterial pathogens such as staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to eradicate and are major sources of bacterial infections. new drugs are needed to  combat these pathogens. hypericum is a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. however, the specific constituents responsible for the antimicrobial properties are not entirely known, nor have most compounds been tested as inhibitors of biofilm development. the investigation presented here tested seven secondary metabolites isolated from the species hypericum densiflorum, hypericum ellipticum, hypericum prolificum, and hypericum punctatum  as inhibitors of bacterial growth and biofilm production. assays were conducted against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii. five of the seven compounds demonstrated growth inhibition against the gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.95 microg/ml to 7.81 microg/ml. four of the secondary metabolites inhibited biofilm production by certain gram-positive strains at sub-mic concentrations.

TI  == antimicrobial acrylic materials with in situ generated silver nanoparticles.
AB  == polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) is widely used to treat traumatic head injuries (cranioplasty) and orthopedic injuries (bone cement), but there is a problem with implant-centered infections. with organisms such as acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus developing resistance to antibiotics, there is a need for novel antimicrobial delivery mechanisms without risk of developing resistant organisms. objectives: to develop a novel antimicrobial implant material by generating silver nanoparticles (agnp) in situ in pmma. results: all pmma samples with agnp's (agnp-pmma) released ag(+) ions in vitro for over 28 days. in vitro antimicrobial assays revealed that these samples (even samples with the slowest release rate) inhibited 99.9% of bacteria against four different strains of bacteria. long-term antimicrobial assay showed a continued antibacterial effect past 28 days. some agnp-loaded pmma groups had comparable durometer-d hardness (a measure of degree of cure) and modulus to control pmma, but all experimental groups had slightly lower ultimate transverse strengths. conclusions: agnp-pmma demonstrated a tremendously broad-spectrum and long-intermediate-term antimicrobial effect with comparable mechanical properties to control pmma. current efforts are focused on further improving mechanical properties by reducing agnp loading and assessing fatigue properties.

TI  == herpes simplex activation prolongs recovery from severe burn injury and increases bacterial infection risk.
AB  == recovery from severe burn injury is complicated by infections that are result of  immune suppression created by massive inflammatory states. one indication of immune suppression may be activation of viruses like herpes simplex virus (hsv),  which may negatively impact recovery. a 5-year retrospective review was performed of adult patients with >/=30% tbsa burn injury. tbsa burn injury, length of hospital stay, ventilator days, mortality, and cultures were reviewed. twenty-one patients had cutaneous hsv activation (hsv+) and 50 did not (hsv-). age (44.2 vs  39.8 years) and tbsa burn injury (45.9 vs 45.5%) did not differ between the groups. length of hospital stay (60.9 vs 39.8 days, p < .05) and ventilator days  (34.9 vs 22.2 days, p < .05) were greater in hsv+ patients. hsv activation increased hospital stay (odds ratio [or] 1.6, confidence interval [ci] 1.08-2.39, p < .05) and mechanical ventilation (or 1.02, ci 1.00-1.05, p < .05). hsv activation increased the risk of developing positive acinetobacter baumannii pulmonary cultures (or 6.4, ci 1.8-22.3, p < .05) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus wound cultures (or 3.3, ci 1.2-9.6, p < .05). hsv activation also increased the risk of developing any positive a. baumannii cultures (or 9.1, ci 1.9-44, p < .05). hsv activation during severe burn injury is associated with increased length of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay.  in addition, these patients have an increased risk of infections from opportunistic bacteria.

TI  == antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  == fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (staphylococcus aureus ep167, acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) and candida albicans my1055) and two probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lch17 and lactobacillus brevis lch23). a total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. a total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus ep167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rrna sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders pleosporales, hypocreales and xylariales dominated. differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed  among isolates from the same species. some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.

TI  == effectiveness of low-temperature domestic laundry on the decontamination of healthcare workers' uniforms.
AB  == objective: most professionals in the healthcare environment wear uniforms. for the purpose of this study, we concentrated on nurses' uniforms. in the united kingdom, many nurses are expected to launder their uniforms at home by using a domestic washing machine that frequently has low-temperature wash cycles. we have investigated whether the use of low-temperature wash cycles results in a microbiologically acceptable product to wear on the wards. methods: we have assessed the bioburden on uniforms before and after laundry and the effectiveness of low-temperature wash cycles and ironing on removal of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii. we did not assess the role of tumble drying. results: we demonstrate contamination of uniforms by gram-negative bacteria after wash, the removal of mrsa at low-temperature wash cycles in the presence of detergent, and the eradication of gram-negative bacteria after ironing. conclusions: our conclusions are that laundry in a domestic situation at 60 degrees c (140 degrees f) for 10 minutes is sufficient to decontaminate hospital uniforms and reduces the bacterial load by more than 7-log reduction, that items left in the pockets are decontaminated to the same extent, that the addition of either a biological detergent or a nonbiological detergent is beneficial in removing mrsa from experimentally contaminated swatches, and that uniforms become recontaminated with low numbers of principally gram-negative bacteria after laundry but that these are effectively removed by ironing.

TI  == antimicrobial fibers: therapeutic possibilities and recent advances.
AB  == the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (carbapenemase)-producing enterobacteriaceae is becoming a serious threat. new-generation antimicrobial agents need to be developed. this includes the design of novel antimicrobial compounds and drug-delivery systems. this review provides an introduction into different classes of antimicrobial materials. the main focus is on strategies for the introduction of antimicrobial  properties in polymer materials. these can be roughly divided into surface modification, inclusion of antimicrobial compounds that can leach from the polymer, and the introduction of polymer-bound moieties that provide the polymer  with antimicrobial properties. one of the main challenges in the development of antimicrobial polymers for the use in contact with human tissue is the concomitant demand of non-cytotoxicity. current research is strongly focused on the latter aspect.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial studies of silver carbene complexes: activity of free and  nanoparticle carbene formulations against clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: silver carbenes may represent novel, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have low toxicity while providing varying chemistry for targeted applications. here, the bactericidal activity of four silver carbene complexes (sccs) with different formulations, including nanoparticles (nps) and micelles, was tested against a panel of clinical strains of bacteria and fungi that are the causative agents of many skin and soft tissue, respiratory, wound, blood, and nosocomial infections. methods: mic, mbc and multidose experiments were conducted against a broad range of bacteria and fungi. time-release and cytotoxicity studies of the compounds were also carried out. free sccs and scc nps were tested against a panel of medically important pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mrab), pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia and klebsiella pneumoniae. results:  all four sccs demonstrated strong efficacy in concentration ranges of 0.5-90 mg/l. clinical bacterial isolates with high inherent resistance to purified compounds were more effectively treated either with an np formulation of these compounds or by repeated dosing. overall, the compounds were active against highly resistant bacterial strains, such as mrsa and mrab, and were active against the biodefence pathogens bacillus anthracis and yersinia pestis. all of the medically important bacterial strains tested play a role in many different infectious diseases. conclusions: the four sccs described here, including their development as np therapies, show great promise for treating a wide variety of bacterial and fungal pathogens that are not easily killed by routine antimicrobial agents.

TI  == synthesis, characterization, and light-controlled antibiotic application of a composite material derived from polyurethane and silica xerogel with embedded photoactive manganese nitrosyl.
AB  == the synthesis of a light-sensitive polyurethane-based composite material (pux-no) is described. in its polyurethane medium, pux-no contains entrapped silica xerogel particles in which a photoactive manganese nitrosyl has been incorporated. green flexible films of pux-no readily release nitric oxide (no) only when exposed to low power (mw) visible light. incorporation of the nitrosyl  in the xerogel not only retains the nitrosyl (no donor) within the composite material but also provides the right extent of hydration. pre-swelled films of pux-no have water content close to 30 wt % and such films can be stored for months under slightly moist condition without loss in no-delivering capacity. the no-releasing parameters of the film have been determined. the no-releasing capacity of pux-no films can be conveniently altered by changing the amount of the nitrosyl as well as the thickness of the films. patches of pux-no film have been successfully employed to reduce drastically bacterial loads of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii under the total control of light. effective control of infections by these bacterial pathogens via delivery  of proper doses of no only to the sites of infection appears feasible with pux-no films.

TI  == prevention of infections associated with combat-related extremity injuries.
AB  == during combat operations, extremities continue to be the most common sites of injury with associated high rates of infectious complications. overall, approximately 15% of patients with extremity injuries develop osteomyelitis, and  approximately 17% of those infections relapse or recur. the bacteria infecting these wounds have included multidrug-resistant bacteria such as acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella species and escherichia coli, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the goals of extremity injury care are to prevent infection, promote fracture healing, and restore function. in this review, we use a systematic assessment of military and civilian extremity trauma data to provide evidence-based recommendations for the varying management strategies to care for  combat-related extremity injuries to decrease infection rates. we emphasize postinjury antimicrobial therapy, debridement and irrigation, and surgical wound  management including addressing ongoing areas of controversy and needed research. in addition, we address adjuvants that are increasingly being examined, including local antimicrobial therapy, flap closure, oxygen therapy, negative pressure wound therapy, and wound effluent characterization. this evidence-based medicine  review was produced to support the guidelines for the prevention of infections associated with combat-related injuries: 2011 update contained in this supplement of journal of trauma.

TI  == current review of antimicrobial treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia (including ventilator-associated pneumonia; vap), a consistently difficult-to-treat entity, is frequently caused by multidrug-resistant (mdr) or pandrug-resistant (pdr) bacteria. given the high mortality rates caused by drug-resistant bacteria and the difficulty of developing new potent antibiotics to target the problematic pathogens, combination regimens are under ardent evaluation as new strategies to overcome increasing drug resistance. adjustment of the administration method of certain beta-lactams (meropenem, or imipenem/cilastatin), or combination of tigecycline with some agents, may show promise with regard to successful management of mdr or pdr acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia. additionally, vancomycin plus rifampicin is an effective regimen against nosocomial pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) responding poorly to vancomycin monotherapy. the clinical appropriateness of parenteral colistin against pneumonia caused by mdr a. baumannii has been established in a clinical trial. facing the decline of clinical vancomycin efficacy after initial use, linezolid might be the drug of choice with regard to the treatment of mrsa-vap. the role of tigecycline monotherapy for the management of nosocomial pneumonia caused by mrsa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae  needs to be cautiously evaluated.

TI  == [changes in the incidence of multiresistant pathogens and its consequences in the intensive care unit].
AB  == incidence of nosocomial infections and antibiotics resistance in intensive care units is increasing worldwide. blood-stream infections of gram-negative non-fermentive bacteria are associated with higher mortality. aim and methods: the aim of this study was to compare the antibiotic sensitivity of nosocomial blood-stream infections between years 2008-2010. results: there was no difference in the sensitivity of methycillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli infections between the two years examined. antibiotic resistance of acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas infections showed a marked increase in 2010 when compared to that found in 2008: there was no multiresistant acinetobacter infection in samples obtained in 2008, but all these infections were found to be  sensitive only to colistin in samples investigated in 2010. sensitivity of pseudomonas infections to carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam decreased significantly during this time. in addition, the authors found that the mortality of multiresistant gram-negative blood-stream infections was higher compared to that caused by non-multiresistant bacteria. conclusions: these results emphasize  the importance of infection control, adequate dosing and timing of antibiotics, and an appropriate number of nurses in intensive care unit.

TI  == efficacy of point-of-injury combat antimicrobials.
AB  == background: infection is a major complication associated with combat-related injuries. one strategy to decrease infections is immediate delivery of antimicrobials at or near the point-of-injury by the casualty or the first medical responder. the 75th ranger regiment systematically collects data on prehospital battlefield care, including antimicrobial administration. we review infectious complications and colonization rates associated with delivery of point-of-injury antimicrobial therapy. methods: we retrospectively reviewed casualty treatment data from the 75th ranger regiment prehospital trauma registry on patients injured between march 2003 and march 2010 and linked this to electronic medical record data to look for the presence of bacterial infection or colonization within 30 days of injury. patient demographics, antimicrobial therapy, and outcomes were evaluated. assessment of colonization included surveillance screening cultures performed for multidrug-resistant bacteria, including acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, at us military hospitals in the combat zone, germany, and stateside. results: of 405 total casualties, 28 (6.9%) were infected with gram-negative bacteria, primarily a. baumannii. of those who were not returned to duty or died  near the time of injury, 28 of 211 (13.3%) were infected. the only identified risk factor for infection was higher military injury severity score. prehospital  administration of antimicrobials to 113 of 405 casualties (27.9%), including 8 of the 28 infected casualties, did not affect infection or colonization rates. conclusions: although limited by population size, a significant difference in infection rates and multidrug-resistant pathogen colonization was not seen in those casualties who received single-dose broad-spectrum antimicrobials at the point-of-injury, confirming neither benefit nor harm. overall adherence with initiating point-of-injury antimicrobials was low.

TI  == [common antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in nosocomial infections in taiwan and their prevention].
AB  == infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant strains (mdr) that cause difficulties in clinical treatment,  have long been a problem of global concern. drug-resistant strains of common nosocomial infections in taiwan include gram-positive coccal methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and gram-negative bacilli such as carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, among others. about 10 to 20% of gram-negative bacteria that encode extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are resistant to cephalosporin, a third generation antibiotic, and the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate has continued to increase in recent years. despite the high mortality rate in patients with infections caused by mdr, the problem is still solvable by blocking or reducing mdr dissemination in addition to proper antibiotics use. hand hygiene is the simplest, most effective measure for preventing nosocomial infections. however, healthcare workers' adherence to recommended hand hygiene practices is unacceptably low worldwide, making the promotion of hand hygiene a major challenge for infection control experts. therefore, as a first step of preventing the spread of mdr bacteria, knowledge of hand hygiene and adherence to hand hygiene practices must be required of healthcare workers. such should help reduce nosocomial infections significantly and upgrade healthcare quality.

TI  == the challenges of antimicrobial drug resistance in greece.
AB  == antimicrobial drug resistance rates in greece are among the highest in europe. the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative species has increased considerably, including endemic strains in intensive care units. pandrug-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are sporadically reported. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus rates are also high in greek hospitals. multidrug resistance increases risk of mortality, hospitalization duration and costs, and undermines the medical system. administrative responses initiated include action plans, monitoring systems, and guidelines. common terminology among involved parties for defining and grading resistance is required. multidrug-resistant microorganisms challenge clinical laboratories; uniform recommendations towards detection of resistance mechanisms need to be established. prospective multicenter outcome studies comparing antibiotic regimens and containment methods are needed. because new antimicrobials against gram-negative pathogens are not foreseeable, judicious use of the existing and strict adherence to infection control best practice might restrain resistance spread. awareness of resistance patterns and organisms prevailing locally by reporting laboratories and treating physicians is important.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == the role played by contaminated surfaces in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == studies in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that environmental surface contamination played a negligible role in the endemic transmission of healthcare-associated infections. however, recent studies have demonstrated that several major nosocomial pathogens are shed by patients and contaminate hospital surfaces at concentrations sufficient for transmission, survive for extended periods, persist despite attempts to disinfect or remove them, and can be transferred to the hands of healthcare workers. evidence is accumulating that contaminated surfaces make an important contribution to the epidemic and endemic transmission of clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and norovirus and that improved environmental decontamination contributes to the control of outbreaks. efforts to improve environmental hygiene should include enhancing the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection and reducing the shedding of pathogens. further high-quality studies are needed to clarify the role played by surfaces in nosocomial transmission and to determine the effectiveness of different interventions in reducing associated infection rates.

TI  == effect of antibiotic diversity on ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by eskape organisms.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to test in the clinic whether antimicrobial diversity affects resistance of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella species, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). methods: three different strategies of empirical antimicrobial prescription for vap were consecutively implemented in an icu: patient specific (10 months); scheduling, including sequential quarterly prioritization (12 months) and restriction (12 months) of antimicrobials; and mixing (10 months). periods were compared, measuring the antimicrobial heterogeneity index (ahi). incidence and resistance patterns of vap caused by eskape were compared. results: overall, 127  microbiologic vap episodes were documented. eskape vap increased significantly during scheduling (ahi, 0.65) compared with patient-specific (ahi, 0.88) and mixing (ahi, 0.87) periods (relative risk, 2.67 and 3.84, respectively). this finding was associated with a significant (p < .05) increase of carbapenem-resistant a baumannii during the scheduling period (15.0%) compared with the patient-specific (2.4%) and mixing (0%) periods. icu mortality of resistant patients with eskape vap was doubled that of patients without eskape vap (relative risk, 2.25; 95% ci, 1.67-9.48). thirty-day mechanical ventilation-free days was significantly increased (5 days) in patients with resistant eskape vap. conclusions: antibiotic strategies promoting diversity may  prevent the emergence of resistance of eskape organisms, improving use of health-care resources.

AB  == objective: to study changes in the drug-resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) and the use of antibiotics in burn wards so as to optimize the use of antibiotic  in the future. methods: bacteria were isolated from specimens of blood, venous catheter, stool, sputum, urine, wound tissue from 5717 patients hospitalized in our burn wards within the duration of january 2005 to december 2009. the number of specimens examined and positive rates of bacteria were calculated. changes in  constituent ratio of cocci and bacilli, spectrum of bacteria, the drug-resistance rate of pa, and the usage of antibiotics were analyzed. the number of specimens examined, constituent ratio of cocci and bacilli, drug-resistance rate were processed with chi-square test. bivariate correlation analysis was performed between the usage of antibiotics and the drug-resistance rate. results: (1) the number of specimens examined showed no statistical difference during the five years (with rates from 73.2% to 76.1%, chi(2) = 5.583, p > 0.05), while constituent ratio of cocci and bacilli showed statistical difference (with ratios from 105:134 to 169:126, chi(2) = 14.806, p < 0.01). the positive rates of bacteria were increasing in the five years. (2) one thousand six hundred and seventy-five strains were identified during the five years from different kinds of specimens, with 29 from blood, 39 from venous catheter, 3 from stool, 157 from sputum, 13 from urine, and 1434 from wound tissue. among them, staphylococcus aureus accounted for 28% to 42%, pa accounted for 10% to 25%, acinetobacter baumannii accounted for 10% to 19%, and they were the predominant strains. (3) the difference among drug-resistance rates of pa to each kind of 12 antibiotics during the five years were statistically significant (with chi(2) values from 47.911 to 308.095, p values all below 0.01). the drug-resistance rates of pa to some antibiotics showed downward trend in the former four years, including amikacin, ceftazidime, and imipenem/cilastatin, but it rebounded in the fifth year. (4) there was descending trend in usage of cefoperazone/sulbactam and levofloxacin, but vancomycin was always used widely. (5) drug-resistance rates of pa to 7 antibiotics, including amikacin, imipenem/cilastatin, and ciprofloxacin,  etc., were positively correlated with usage of various antibiotics (with r values from 0.879 to 0.978, p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). conclusions: in our burn wards, drug-resistant pa was prevalent. disinfection and isolation measures, appropriate use of antibiotics, etc. can reduce pa infection.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

AB  == chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of gram-positive methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a cfu assay. the hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. a dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn  model infected with bioluminescent p. aeruginosa. the survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (p  = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and p = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. these data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.

TI  == risk factors and pathogen profile of ventilator-associated pneumonia in a neonatal intensive care unit in china.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to explore the incidence and risk factors of, and summarize the involved pathogens in, neonates with ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) in the authors' neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) to determine the effective strategies for prevention. methods: a retrospective case-control study including 117 vap patients and 232 controls was  conducted from january 2002 to july 2008. the antibiotics sensitivity spectrum was determined on quantitative microbiological evaluation. multiple logistic regression and cox model analysis were performed to determine independent and accumulative risk factors for vap. results: multivariate analysis showed that birthweight, mechanical ventilation (mv), parenteral alimentation, dexamethasone  and other respiratory disease were associated with the development of vap. the cumulative risk for developing vap increased over the duration of stay in the nicu. the most common isolated bacteria of the pathogen spectrum in vap were klebsiella spp. (33/146), acinetobacter baumannii (26/146), pseudomonas aeruginosa (18/146) and staphylococcus aureus(13/146). meanwhile, we found that previous use of antibiotics before vap diagnosis was not associated with the onset of vap. conclusions: the daily risk for vap increases with duration of stay in the nicu after ventilation. drug-resistant bacteria are common pathogens for neonatal vap in the authors' nicu.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  == wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. it is therefore imperative that  antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at west virginia university hospital. standardised corrected zones of inhibition (czois) were performed on all clinical isolates. it was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. in particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of candida albicans and yeasts with czoi of 3-11.5 mm. all meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains were  found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a czoi range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. czois of 4.25 mm were calculated for enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. the bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumannii. contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and candida albicans. no antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by kirby bauer clinical laboratory standards institute classification  system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. when a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. this finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.

TI  == the challenges of antimicrobial resistance in brazil.
AB  == brazil is a country with continental proportions with high geographic and economic diversity. despite its medical centers of excellence, antimicrobial resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge. rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus are up to 60% and are related to an endemic brazilian clone. local resistance to vancomycin in enterococci was first related to enterococcus faecalis, which differs from european and american epidemiology. also, local klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have a much higher prevalence (40%-50% and 10%-18%, respectively). carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae group  is becoming a major problem, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase isolates have been reported in different states. among nonfermenters, carbapenem resistance is strongly related to spm-1 (pseudomonasaeruginosa) and oxa-23 (acinetobacter baumannii complex) enzymes, and a colistin-only susceptible phenotype has also emerged in these isolates, which is worrisome. local actions without loosing the  global resistance perspective will demand multidisciplinary actions, new policies, and political engagement.

TI  == causative pathogen dictates optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia in trauma patients.
AB  == background: recent ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) guidelines recommend considering abbreviated therapy in patients with non-pseudomonas aeruginosa vap if clinical signs resolve. however, using an arbitrary day cutoff or clinical signs can be suboptimal for some, especially multiply injured patients, resulting in relapse and/or antibiotic resistance. previously, we showed that repeat bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) could guide antimicrobial duration for community-acquired vap in trauma patients. the purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy for vap in trauma patients secondary to hospital-acquired pathogens. study design: patients with vap secondary to mrsa, pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa), acinetobacter baumannii (ab), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (sm), or enterobacteriaceae (enb) during 6 years were evaluated. all received empiric antimicrobial therapy based on duration of icu stay. therapy was tailored based on culture data. repeat bal was performed on day 4 of appropriate therapy. microbiological resolution was defined as </=10(3)  colony-forming units/ml. recurrence was defined as >/=10(5) colony-forming units/ml on subsequent bal performed within 2 weeks after completion of appropriate therapy. results: six hundred and fifty-nine patients were identified. seventy-seven percent of patients underwent repeat bal: 96 with mrsa, 100 with ab, 139 with pa, 50 with sm, and 120 with enb. the majority of patients  with mrsa or pa achieved microbiological resolution after 14 days. nearly 60% of  patients with ab, sm, or enb achieved microbiological resolution after 10 days. overall recurrence was 2%. conclusions: repeat bal provides objective evidence for vap resolution in the face of potentially confounding clinical factors. hospital-acquired vap can be managed effectively by a defined course of therapy with a low recurrence. duration of antimicrobial therapy for vap in trauma patients should be dictated by the causative pathogen.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == immobilization of amphiphilic polycations by catechol functionality for antimicrobial coatings.
AB  == a new strategy for preparing antimicrobial surfaces by a simple dip-coating procedure is reported. amphiphilic polycations with different mole ratios of monomers containing dodecyl quaternary ammonium, methoxyethyl, and catechol groups were synthesized by free-radical polymerization. the polymer coatings were prepared by immersing glass slides into a polymer solution and subsequent drying  and heating. the quaternary ammonium side chains endow the coatings with potent antibacterial activity, the methoxyethyl side chains enable tuning the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, and the catachol groups promote immobilization of the polymers into films. the polymer-coated surfaces displayed bactericidal activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in a dynamic contact  assay and prevented the accumulation of viable e. coli, s. aureus, and acinetobacter baumannii for up to 96 h. atomic force microscopy (afm) images of coating surfaces indicated that the surfaces exhibit virtually the same smoothness for all polymers except the most hydrophobic. the hydrophobic polymer  without methoxyethyl side chains showed clear structuring into polymer domains, causing high surface roughness. sum-frequency generation (sfg) vibrational spectroscopy characterization of the surface structures demonstrated that the dodecyl chains are predominantly localized at the surface-air interface of the coatings. sfg also showed that the phenyl groups of the catechols are oriented on the substrate surface. these results support our hypothesis that the adhesive or  cross-linking functionality of catechol groups discourages polymer leaching, allowing the tuning of the amphiphilic balance by incorporating hydrophilic components into the polymer chains to gain potent biocidal activity.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy of peptide a3-apo in mouse models of multidrug-resistant wound and lung infections cannot be explained by in vitro activity against the pathogens involved.
AB  == although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide a3-apo has only modest activity against escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse  models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with  conventional antibiotics. in this study, the efficacy of a3-apo in several additional mouse models was investigated, including staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed klebsiella pneumoniae-a. baumannii-proteus mirabilis wound infection and k. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. in the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following a3-apo treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. the wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a3-apo upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. one of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.

TI  == bacteremia is an independent risk factor for mortality in nosocomial pneumonia: a prospective and observational multicenter study.
AB  == introduction: since positive blood cultures are uncommon in patients with nosocomial pneumonia (np), the responsible pathogens are usually isolated from respiratory samples. studies on bacteremia associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) have reported fatality rates of up to 50%. the purpose of the study is to compare risk factors, pathogens and outcomes between bacteremic nosocomial pneumonia (b-np) and nonbacteremic nosocomial pneumonia (nb-np) episodes. methods: this is a prospective, observational and multicenter study (27 intensive care units in nine european countries). consecutive patients requiring  invasive mechanical ventilation for an admission diagnosis of pneumonia or on mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours irrespective of admission diagnosis were recruited. results: a total of 2,436 patients were evaluated; 689 intubated patients presented with np, 224 of them developed hap and 465 developed ventilation-acquired pneumonia. blood samples were extracted in 479 (69.5%) patients, 70 (14.6%) being positive. b-np patients had higher simplified acute physiology score (saps) ii score (51.5 +/- 19.8 vs. 46.6 +/- 17.5, p = 0.03) and  were more frequently medical patients (77.1% vs. 60.4%, p = 0.01). mortality in the intensive care unit was higher in b-np patients compared with nb-np patients  (57.1% vs. 33%, p < 0.001). b-np patients had a more prolonged mean intensive care unit length of stay after pneumonia onset than nb-np patients (28.5 +/- 30.6 vs. 20.5 +/- 17.1 days, p = 0.03). logistic regression analysis confirmed that medical patients (odds ratio (or) = 5.72, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.93 to  16.99, p = 0.002), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) etiology (or = 3.42, 95% ci = 1.57 to 5.81, p = 0.01), acinetobacter baumannii etiology (or = 4.78, 95% ci = 2.46 to 9.29, p < 0.001) and days of mechanical ventilation  (or = 1.02, 95% ci = 1.01 to 1.03, p < 0.001) were independently associated with  b-np episodes. bacteremia (or = 2.01, 95% ci = 1.22 to 3.55, p = 0.008), diagnostic category (medical patients (or = 3.71, 95% ci = 2.01 to 6.95, p = 0.02) and surgical patients (or = 2.32, 95% ci = 1.10 to 4.97, p = 0.03)) and higher saps ii score (or = 1.02, 95% ci = 1.01 to 1.03, p = 0.008) were independent risk factors for mortality. conclusions: b-np episodes are more frequent in patients with medical admission, mrsa and a. baumannii etiology and prolonged mechanical ventilation, and are independently associated with higher mortality rates.

TI  == the prevention of biofilm colonization by multidrug-resistant pathogens that cause ventilator-associated pneumonia with antimicrobial-coated endotracheal tubes.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) continues to be the nosocomial infection associated with the highest mortality in critically ill patients. since silver-coated endotracheal tubes (ett) was shown in a multicenter prospective randomized trials to decrease the risk of vap, we compared the efficacy of two antiseptic agents such as gardine- and gendine-coated etts with that of silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. the etts were tested for their ability  to prevent the biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and candida albicans. scanning electron microscopy studies  revealed a heavy biofilm on uncoated and silver-coated ett but not on the gardine-coated ett. the gardine and gendine etts completely inhibited the formation of biofilms by all organisms tested and were more effective in preventing biofilm growth than the silver etts (p < 0.001). the gardine- and gendine-coated etts were more durable against mrsa than either the silver-coated  or uncoated etts for up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001). we have therefore shown that gardine- and gendine-coated etts are superior to silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. future animal and clinical studies are warranted to determine whether the gardine- and gendine-coated etts can significantly reduce the risk of vap.

TI  == chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. this study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the pdi efficacy against gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa),  as well as the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by  coincubation with hematoporphyrin (hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the pdi effect or by addition after pdi and further incubation for 30 min. under  conditions in which hp-pdi killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8)  cfu/ml). similar results were also found with toluidine blue o (tbo)-mediated pdi in planktonic and biofilm cells. however, without pdi treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by pdi. further studies indicated that the potentiated pdi effect  of chitosan was related to the level of pdi damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. these results indicate that the combination of pdi and chitosan is  quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of acinetobacter baumannii phage varphiab2 endolysin (lysab2) against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == to investigate the nature and origin of the antibacterial activity of the lytic phage varphiab2 toward acinetobacter baumannii, we successfully isolated and characterized a novel phage lysozyme (endolysin) from varphiab2 and named it lysab2. to analyze antibacterial activity of lysab2, the complete lysab2 and two  deletion derivatives were constructed, purified and characterized. zymographic assays showed that only the intact lysab2 could lyse the peptidoglycan of a. baumannii and the staphylococcus aureus cell wall. antibacterial analysis also showed that only the intact lysab2 retained the complete bactericidal activity. when applied exogenously, lysab2 exhibited a broad bacteriolytic activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. thermostability assays indicated that lysab2 was stable at 20 approximately 40 degrees c. its optimal ph was 6.0, and it was active from ph 4 to 8. scanning electron microscopy revealed  that exposure to 500 mugml(-1) lysab2 for up to 60 min caused a remarkable modification of the cell shape of the bacteria. treating bacteria with lysab2 clearly enhanced permeation of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. these results  indicate that lysab2 is an effective lysozyme against bacteria, and they suggest  that it is a good candidate for a therapeutic/disinfectant agent to control nosocomial infections caused by multiple drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  == acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of suprathel (polymedics innovations gmbh, denkendorf, germany) in combination with  various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. the study  was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [hibicet]). as a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive  bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups a and b. the tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, and a baumannii, except for the combination of  suprathel and mafenide acetate. it can be concluded that suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. the authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. the combination of  suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.

TI  == purification and properties of antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of the eritrea clawed frog xenopus clivii (pipidae).
AB  == five peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the tetraploid frog xenopus clivii peracca, 1898 (pipidae). characterization of the peptides demonstrated that they  are structurally similar to magainins (2 peptides), caerulein-precursor fragments, cpf (2 peptides), and xenopsin-precursor fragments, xpf (1 peptide) that have been previously isolated from other species of the genus xenopus. the magainins and the xpf peptide were active only against the gram-negative microorganism escherichia coli whereas the cpf peptides were also active against  the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus. the most abundant antimicrobial peptide  in the secretions, cpf-c1 (gfgsllgkalrlg anvl.nh(2)) inhibited the growth of the  gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic</=25mum) suggesting potential for development into an anti-infective agent for use against these emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

TI  == identification of streptomyces sp. kh29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the actinomycete strain kh29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. based on the diaminopimelic acid (dap) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (sem), kh29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus  streptomyces. by way of its noted 16s rdna nucleotide sequences, kh29 was found to have a relationship with streptomyces cinnamonensis. the production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (py) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees c. the antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including ms and nmr as a cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). cyclo(l-trp-l-trp), from the py cultures of kh29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant acinetobacter baumannii. furthermore, cyclo(ltrp- l-trp) had antimicrobial activity against bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, aspergillus  niger, and candida albicans, however, it was ineffective against streptomyces murinus.

TI  == clinical outcomes of health-care-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted to european intensive-care units: a cohort study.
AB  == background: patients admitted to intensive-care units are at high risk of health-care-associated infections, and many are caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. we aimed to assess excess mortality and length of stay in intensive-care units from bloodstream infections and pneumonia. methods: we analysed data collected prospectively from intensive-care units that reported according to the european standard protocol for surveillance of health-care-associated infections. we focused on the most frequent causative microorganisms. resistance was defined as resistance to ceftazidime (acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa), third-generation cephalosporins (escherichia coli), and oxacillin (staphylococcus aureus). we defined 20 different exposures according to infection site, microorganism, and resistance status. for every exposure, we compared outcomes between patients exposed and unexposed by use of time-dependent regression modelling. we adjusted  results for patients' characteristics and time-dependency of the exposure. findings: we obtained data for 119 699 patients who were admitted for more than 2 days to 537 intensive-care units in ten countries between jan 1, 2005, and dec 31, 2008. excess risk of death (hazard ratio) for pneumonia in the fully adjusted model ranged from 1.7 (95% ci 1.4-1.9) for drug-sensitive s aureus to 3.5 (2.9-4.2) for drug-resistant p aeruginosa. for bloodstream infections, the excess risk ranged from 2.1 (1.6-2.6) for drug-sensitive s aureus to 4.0 (2.7-5.8) for drug-resistant p aeruginosa. risk of death associated with antimicrobial resistance (ie, additional risk of death to that of the infection) was 1.2 (1.1-1.4) for pneumonia and 1.2 (0.9-1.5) for bloodstream infections for a combination of all four microorganisms, and was highest for s aureus (pneumonia 1.3 [1.0-1.6], bloodstream infections 1.6 [1.1-2.3]). antimicrobial resistance did not significantly increase length of stay; the hazard ratio for discharge, dead or alive, for sensitive microorganisms compared with resistant microorganisms (all four combined) was 1.05 (0.97-1.13) for pneumonia and 1.02 (0.98-1.17) for bloodstream infections. p aeruginosa had the highest burden of health-care-acquired infections because of its high prevalence and pathogenicity  of both its drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. interpretation: health-care-associated bloodstream infections and pneumonia greatly increase mortality and pneumonia increase length of stay in intensive-care units; the additional effect of the most common antimicrobial resistance patterns is comparatively low. funding: european commission (dg sanco).

TI  == changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections in 11 teaching hospitals in taiwan between 1993 and 2006.
AB  == background/purpose: healthcare-associated infections, formerly known as nosocomial infections, are one of the most important issues in current practice.  understanding trends in overall infection rates, as well as their incidence and proportion among different causative organisms, can help us to better define our  infection control methods and therapy goals. to understand the changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsi) in taiwan, we retrospectively collected nosocomial infection data from 11 hospitals and examined the trends and changing patterns of nosocomial bsi. methods: eleven major teaching hospitals in taiwan were invited to participate in the study. the  overall density of nosocomial infections and major bsi-causing organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and candida species, were collected. the distribution of the different candida species was also recorded. background parameters from the 11 hospitals, including the size of the hospital, hospital capacity, the number of blood stream infection events, and average length of stay, were also recorded. results: the incidence of nosocomial bsi ranged 0.23-2.56 per 1,000 patient-days, which accounted for 8-43% of all nosocomial infections. the most common causative organism of nosocomial bacteremia was s. aureus, ranging 0.88-0.01 per 1,000 patient-days. overall, the  incidence of s. aureus bacteremia has decreased over the last 13 years, but this  difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). the rate of candida fungemia (p < 0.01) and a. baumannii (p = 0.03) bacteremia increased significantly. c. albicans accounted for most cases of nosocomial fungemia, ranging from 40% to 80%, followed by candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis and candida glabrata. however, the incidence varied significantly from hospital to hospital, and the highest incidence was observed in a cancer center. conclusion:  the overall incidence rate of s. aureus bacteremia in the 11 major hospitals studied had decreased over the last decade, though the difference was not statistically significant. however, the rate of candida fungemia and a. baumannii bacteremia had increased significantly.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia in trauma patients is associated with lower mortality: results from eu-vap study.
AB  == background: differences in trauma patients developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) are described regarding etiology and risk factors associated. we  aim to describe the differences in outcomes in trauma and nontrauma patients with vap. methods: a prospective, observational study conducted in 27 intensive care units from nine european countries. we included patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for >48 hours who developed vap. logistic regression model was used to assess the factors independently associated with mortality in trauma  patients with vap. results: a total of 2,436 patients were evaluated; 465 developed vap and of these 128 (27.5%) were trauma patients. trauma patients were younger than nontrauma (45.3 +/- 19.4 vs. 61.1 +/- 16.7, p < 0.0001). nontrauma had higher simplified acute physiology score ii compared with trauma patients (45.5 +/- 16.3 vs. 41.1 +/- 15.2, p = 0.009). most prevalent pathogens in trauma  patients with early vap were enterobacteriaceae spp. (46.9% vs. 27.8%, p = 0.06)  followed by methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (30.6% vs. 13%, p = 0.03) and then haemophilus influenzae (14.3% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.02), and the most prevalent pathogen in late vap was acinetobacter baumannii (12.2% vs. 44.4%, p <  0.0001). mortality was higher in nontrauma patients than in trauma patients (42.6% vs. 17.2%, p < 0.001, odds ratio [or] = 3.55, 95%ci = 2.14-5.88). a logistic regression model adjusted for sex, age, severity of illness at intensive care unit admission, and sepsis-related organ failure assessment score at the day of vap diagnosis confirmed that trauma was associated with a lower mortality compared with nontrauma patients (odds ratio [or] = 0.37, 95%ci = 0.21-0.65). conclusions: trauma patients developing vap had different demographic characteristics and episodes of etiology. after adjustment for potential confounders, vap episodes in trauma patients are associated with lower mortality  when compared with nontrauma patients.

TI  == progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
AB  == the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance  to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research  in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to  identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.

TI  == the impact of fluoroquinolones use on antibiotic resistance in an intensive care  burn department.
AB  == background: fluoroquinolones (fq) use has been identified as a risk factor for colonization and infection to methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus(mrsa),  pseudomonas aeruginosae multiresistant(pmr), acinetobacter multiresistant (amr) and multidrug resistant bacteria(mdrb). aim: our study proposes to measure the annual antibiotic use of fq and antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and a. baumannii in an intensive care burn unit. methods: the study was conducted during a 4 year period (1 january 2000 to 31 december 2003). antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method as recommended by the french society of microbiology. the consumption of the following antibiotics: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin was expressed  as the antimicrobial use density (ad) taking into account the quantity of antibiotics in grams converted to defined daily doses (ddd) and the number of day hospitalization. statistical significance was defined as p value < 0. 0 5 for the corresponding correlation coefficient. results: there were statistically significant relationship between use of ciprofloxacin and resistance in p. aeruginosa to this drug (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05). moreover, the ciprofloxacin consumption was correlated with resistance to imipenem (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05) and ceftazidime (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05) in p. aeruginosa . a restriction use of ciprofloxacin has been taken during 2003, it is followed by a significant decrease of resistance to imipenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin in p. aeruginosa (p<0, 05 ). the use of fluoroquinolones was correlated significantly with mrsa (rs=0. 96, p<0. 05) . the restriction use of fq was significantly associated with a decrease of mrsa. the consumption of ciprofloxacin was also correlated (p<0. 05) with resistance of ceftazidime in k. pneumoniae. however, there is not a correlation (p> 0. 05) between fluoroquinolones use and resistance in a. baumannii as well in ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ceftazidime. conclusion: our study illustrates the pressure of selection of fluoroquinolones use in the development of mdrb. the use and or the duration of treatment with theses antibiotics should be rationalised as part of efforts to control the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria.

TI  == chemical composition and antibacterial activities of illicium verum against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  == in recent years, human pathogenic microorganisms have developed multiple drug resistance and caused serious nosocomial infections. in this study, we identified four new antimicrobial compounds from the chinese herbal medicine illicium verum  and assessed their antibacterial efficacies. the supercritical co(2) and ethanol  extracts of illicium verum showed substantial antibacterial activity against 67 clinical drug-resistant isolates, including 27 acinetobacter baumannii, 20 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 20 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the diethyl ether (ee) fraction obtained from partition extraction and supercritical  co(2) extracts revealed an antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration value of 0.15-0.70 mg/ml and 0.11 mg/ml, respectively. the ee fraction of i. verum showed synergetic effects with some commercial antibiotics.  the antimicrobial mechanism was investigated with killing curves and scanning electron microscopy observation. the chemical components of the extracts were analyzed by spectrophotometry; (e)-anethole, anisyl acetone, anisyl alcohol, and  anisyl aldehyde exhibited antibacterial activity against different clinical isolates. these extracts from i. verum can be further developed into antibiotic medicines due to their proven antibacterial activity.

TI  == design, synthesis, and crystal structures of 6-alkylidene-2'-substituted penicillanic acid sulfones as potent inhibitors of acinetobacter baumannii oxa-24 carbapenemase.
AB  == class d beta-lactamases represent a growing and diverse class of penicillin-inactivating enzymes that are usually resistant to commercial beta-lactamase inhibitors. as many such enzymes are found in multi-drug resistant (mdr) acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, novel beta-lactamase inhibitors are urgently needed. five unique 6-alkylidene-2'-substituted penicillanic acid sulfones (1-5) were synthesized and tested against oxa-24, a clinically important beta-lactamase that inactivates carbapenems and is found in  a. baumannii. based upon the roles tyr112 and met223 play in the oxa-24 beta-lactamase, we also engineered two variants (tyr112ala and tyr112ala,met223ala) to test the hypothesis that the hydrophobic tunnel formed by these residues influences inhibitor recognition. ic(50) values against oxa-24 and two oxa-24 beta-lactamase variants ranged from 10 +/- 1 (4 vs wt) to 338 +/- 20 nm (5 vs tyr112ala, met223ala). compound 4 possessed the lowest k(i) (500 +/- 80  nm vs wt), and 1 possessed the highest inactivation efficiency (k(inact)/k(i) = 0.21 +/- 0.02 mum(-1) s(-1)). electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed  a single covalent adduct, suggesting the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. x-ray structures of oxa-24 complexed to four inhibitors (2.0-2.6 a) reveal the formation of stable bicyclic aromatic intermediates with their carbonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole. these data provide the first structural evidence that 6-alkylidene-2'-substituted penicillin sulfones are effective mechanism-based inactivators of class d beta-lactamases. their unique chemistry makes them developmental candidates. mechanisms for class d hydrolysis and inhibition are discussed, and a pathway for the evolution of the blar1 sensor of  staphylococcus aureus to the class d beta-lactamases is proposed.

TI  == room decontamination with uv radiation.
AB  == objective: to determine the effectiveness of a uv-c-emitting device to eliminate  clinically important nosocomial pathogens in a contaminated hospital room. methods: this study was carried out in a standard but empty hospital room (phase  1) and in a room previously occupied by a patient with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) infection (phase 2) in an acute care tertiary hospital in north carolina from january 21 through september 21, 2009. during phase 1, 8 x 8 cm formica sheets contaminated  with approximately 10(4)-10(5) organisms of mrsa, vre, multidrug-resistant (mdr)  acinetobacter baumannii, or clostridium difficile spores were placed in a hospital room, both in direct line of sight of the uv-c device and behind objects. after timed exposure, the presence of the microbes was assessed. during  phase 2, specific sites in rooms that had housed patients with mrsa or vre infection were sampled before and after uv-c irradiation. after timed exposure, the presence of mrsa and vre and total colony counts were assessed. results: in our test room, the effectiveness of uv-c radiation in reducing the counts of vegetative bacteria on surfaces was more than 99.9% within 15 minutes, and the reduction in c. difficile spores was 99.8% within 50 minutes. in rooms occupied by patients with mrsa, uv-c irradiation of approximately 15 minutes duration resulted in a decrease in total cfus per plate (mean, 384 cfus vs 19 cfus; p < .001), in the number of samples positive for mrsa (81 [20.3%] of 400 plates vs 2  [0.5%] of 400 plates; p < .001), and in mrsa counts per mrsa-positive plate (mean, 37 cfus vs 2 cfus; p < .001). conclusions: this uv-c device was effective  in eliminating vegetative bacteria on contaminated surfaces both in the line of sight and behind objects within approximately 15 minutes and in eliminating c. difficile spores within 50 minutes.

TI  == suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel as an antiseptic dressing: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the treatment of burn wounds is still a challenge regarding the management of antiseptic wound conditioning. especially, in the united states, silver-containing dressings, such as acticoat and aquacel are frequently used. because silver-containing dressings have well-known drawbacks such as an antimicrobial lack against pseudomonas aeruginosa, we sought to develop an alternative dressing method. in previous studies, we could demonstrate the excellent antiseptic properties of acetic acid against common burn unit germs, and in another study, the feasibility and suitability of a suprathel-acetic acid  matrix as an antiseptic dressing. materials and methods: this study was designed  to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive klebsiella pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. results: the tests showed an excellent bactericidal effect of the suprathel-acetic acid matrix particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as proteus vulgaris, p. aeruginosa,  and acinetobacter baumannii. the efficiency was superior to that of acicoat and aquacel. conclusions: our results support the notion, that the suprathel-acetic acid matrix has an excellent bactericidal effect and therefore seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent in the treatment of burn wounds.

AB  == objective: to observe the biofilm (bf) formation of staphylococcus aureus (sa), acinetobacter baumannii (ab) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (pa) on the surface of deep vein catheters in burn patients after infection. methods: the bacteria from  deep vein catheters in 20 patients hospitalized from november 2008 to august 2009 were isolated, and were compared with their respective standard stains. catheters tips were examined with scanning electron microscope (sem). the semi-quantitative adhesion assay of bacterial bf was performed with modified microtiter-plate test, and the thickness of bf was scanned and measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) after double fluorescence staining, after being cultured in vitro for 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and 5 days, respectively. data were processed with grouped t test. results: six strains of sa, 8 strains of ab, and 6 strains of pa, all drug resistant, were isolated from the deep vein catheters. sem showed that the bf structures on the inner surfaces of catheters were in diverse in their shape and degree, characterized by adherence and flake formation, and embedded in polysaccharide matrix. bf gathered in clusters, forming three-dimensional structure, in which small amount of red blood cells were found. a small number of bacteria were incompletely embedded, with some bacteria adhered to them. the absorbance values for sa after 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture (pch) were above the cut-off value, the same for ab at pch 12, 24, 48 and 72, and pa after pch 48. except for pa standard strain, clsm showed scattered green fluorescence, mainly close to the bottom of plate, while the red fluorescence was observed in full scope at pch 24 for each strain. at pch 48 green fluorescence increased obviously and extended upward from the bottom, overlapping partly with red fluorescence, forming yellow fluorescence, and among the bacteria it was most obvious in ab culture, with sa the next. compared with those of the standard stains, the intensity and quantity of fluorescence from the clinical strains were stronger; at pch 72 the green fluorescence increased obviously especially for pa and its standard strain, while the yellow fluorescence was full of the scope for other strains. on in vitro culture day 5, the green fluorescence was dispersed and was  obvious on the bottom of the plate. bf mature time for ab and sa was pch 48, and  for pa was pch 72. the bf thickness of ab was (18.2 +/- 3.6) microm at pch 72, which was thicker than that [(9.4 +/- 2.6) microm] of its standard strain (t = 5.42, p < 0.05), and was also the thickest among the three clinically found strains. conclusions: sa, ab and pa, which are commonly found bacteria in burn patients, can form bf in deep vein catheters. their ability to form bf seems to be stronger than other usually pathogenic strains, especially ab, which is the important pathogen leading to catheter related infection.

TI  == prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in mexico: special focus on acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in mexico over a 3-year period. clinical isolates of a. baumannii (n = 550), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of a.  baumannii, 40% of escherichia coli, 34% of p. aeruginosa, 22% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of a. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. a. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. species from enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. for p. aeruginosa,  the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. with regard to s. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). the high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.

TI  == influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background/purpose: to investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.  methods: this retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between september 2006 and august 2008. results: of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. the mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range,  1-134 days). the median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). a total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). the three most common gram-negative bacilli were serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. notably, glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli other than acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. of the gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. the two most common gram-positive pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including s. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). the in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was  significantly related to gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). conclusion: these findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of  third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.

TI  == overview perspective of bacterial resistance.
AB  == the rapidly escalating prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. this reduced susceptibility to currently available antimicrobial agents  coupled with the progressive shortage of newly approved compounds is a worrisome  situation. major problems are encountered for a growing number of gram-positive (i.e., staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus spp.) and gram-negative pathogens (i.e., pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae). we provide an overview of bacterial resistance focusing on the most common pathogens responsible for infection in both the community and  healthcare settings. in addition, several strategies to curb antimicrobial resistance are also discussed. it is increasingly evident that without the introduction of novel antimicrobial agents, a return to the clinical outcomes associated with the pre-antibiotic era are inevitable.

TI  == diacyl glycerol arginine-based surfactants: biological and physicochemical properties of catanionic formulations.
AB  == in this paper, we report on a catanionic vesicles-based strategy to reduce the cytotoxicity of the diacyl glycerol arginine-based synthetic surfactants 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-o-(n(alpha)-acetyl-l-arginine) hydrochloride (1414rac) and 1,2-dilauroyl-rac-glycero-3-o-(n(alpha)-acetyl-l-arginine) hydrochloride (1212rac). the behavior of these surfactants was studied either as  pure components or after their formulation as pseudo-tetra-chain catanionic mixtures with phosphatidylglycerol (pg) and as cationic mixtures with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (dppc) used as control. the antimicrobial activity of the negatively charged formulations against acinetobacter baumannii was maintained with respect to the surfactant alone, while a significant improvement of the antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus was observed, together with a strong decrease of hemolytic  activity. the influence of the net charge of the catanionic vesicles on membrane  selectivity was studied using model membranes. the dynamics of surface tension changes induced by the addition of 1414rac/pg aqueous dispersions into phospholipid monolayers composed of zwitterionic dppc as model system for mammalian membranes and of negatively charged pg mimicking cytoplasmic membrane of gram-positive bacteria was followed by tensiometry. our results constitute a proof of principle that tuning formulation can reduce the cytotoxicity of many surfactants, opening their possible biological applications.

TI  == acinetobacter baumannii is not associated with osteomyelitis in a rat model: a pilot study.
AB  == background: multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mdr ab) with and without staphylococcus aureus (sa) is a commonly isolated organism in infected segmental  bone defects in combat-related trauma in iraq and afghanistan. although mdr ab in visceral infections is a therapeutic challenge, control of infection appears more common for combat-related osteomyelitis. questions/purposes: using a rat model, we explored the virulence of mdr ab in segmental bone defects alone and in combination with sa. methods: segmental defects in 60 rat femurs were created, stabilized, and inoculated with mdr ab alone and 60 with mdr ab and sa. we performed qualitative and quantitative bacteriology and radiographic assessments  at 2, 4, and 8 weeks for mdr ab and at 1, 2, and 3 weeks for mdr ab and sa. results: quantitative bacteriology revealed a 3- to 5-log decrease in mdr ab from the initial inoculum. after polymicrobial inoculation, only 10 of 60 animals had  positive cultures for mdr ab, whereas 59 of 60 animals had positive cultures for  sa. recovered sa were 2 to 5 log greater than the initial inoculum, while there again was a 3- to 5-log decrease in mdr ab. mdr ab alone did not cause bony lysis, but there was radiographic evidence of new bone formation in 67% of the segmental defects. osteolysis was noted with mdr ab and sa. conclusions: mdr ab did not appear to cause or contribute to clinically apparent osteomyelitis in this pilot study. clinical relevance: resolution of infections in combat-related  segmental bone defects inoculated with mdr ab may be attributable to low virulence. additional studies are needed to confirm low virulence and bone formation with mdr ab.

TI  == secular trends of healthcare-associated infections at a teaching hospital in taiwan, 1981-2007.
AB  == the national taiwan university hospital (ntuh) adopted international guidelines for surveillance and control of healthcare-associated infection (hcai) in 1981. this report describes the secular trends in hcai at the ntuh over the past 27 years according to site of infection, aetiological agents and control measures. clinical and microbiological data were collected by infection prevention and control nurses using a standardised case-record form. specific control programmes were implemented and/or intensified as needed. poisson or negative binomial regression analysis was used to quantify time trends of the incidence of hcai. the annual number of discharges increased from 25 074 to 91 234 with a parallel increase in the charlson comorbidity index. active hcai surveillance and periodic feedback were associated with a marked decrease in surgical site infections from  1981 to 2007 (2.5 vs 0.5 episodes per 100 procedures, p<0.0001). on the other hand, there was a 4.8-fold increase in bloodstream infections (bsis) (0.39 vs 1.88 episodes per 100 discharges, p<0.0001). the average annual increase of pathogen-specific hcai incidence during 1981-2007 was 11.4% for meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 75.4% for extensively drug-resistant a. baumannii (xdrab), and 7.5% for candida albicans (p<0.0001, respectively). the infection prevention and control programme was upgraded in 2004 by implementing annual, intensive, project-based control programmes, and decreases in rates of hcai, bsi, mrsa and xdrab were observed. this long term study demonstrates the need to couple surveillance of hcai with focused control programmes. hospitals must invest in adequate manpower to accomplish these goals.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides with therapeutic potential from skin secretions of the marsabit clawed frog xenopus borealis (pipidae).
AB  == nine peptides with differential growth inhibitory activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin  secretions of the tetraploid frog xenopus borealis parker, 1936 (pipidae). structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that they were orthologous to magainin-2 (1 peptide), peptide glycine-leucine-amide, pgla (2 peptides), caerulein-precursor fragments, cpf (4 peptides), and xenopsin-precursor fragments, xpf (2 peptides), previously isolated from xenopus  laevis and x. amieti. in addition, a second magainin-related peptide (g**kflhsagkfgkaflgevmig) containing a two amino acid residue deletion compared with magainin-2 was identified that had only weak antimicrobial activity. the peptide with the greatest potential for development into a therapeutically valuable anti-infective agent was cpf-b1 (glgsllgkafkiglktvgkmmggapreq) with mic=5 microm against e. coli, mic=5 microm against s. aureus, and mic=25 microm against candida albicans, and low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (lc(50)>200 microm). this peptide was also the most abundant antimicrobial peptide in the skin secretions. cpf-b1 was active against clinical isolates of the nosocomial pathogens, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mdrab) with mic values in the range  4-8 microm.

TI  == rifampin resistance in carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii in siriraj hospital, thailand.
AB  == there is a growing evidence on emergence of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (crab) in thailand and recent treatment guidelines recommend a combination therapy using carbapenem and/or polymyxin with rifampin. rifampin would be added in a combination therapy. the susceptibility of this pathogen to rifampin is not known, so we studied the rifampin susceptibility and possible mechanisms of resistance used by crab. the disk diffusion test was performed on 111 clinical isolates using 5 microg rifampin disk following clsi guidelines. the inhibition zone was interpreted based upon the recommendation for staphylococcus  aureus (inhibition zone < 20 mm = resistant). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the primers specific for arr-2 encoding rifampin adp-ribosyltransferase was performed in all isolates. the rpob dna sequences from two isolates, with or without arr-2, were compared. all isolates under study were rifampin resistant. inhibition zone was < 14 mm for all isolates. the arr-2 was positive for 35 isolates (31.5%) and these isolates correlated with high level of resistance (inhibition zone < 10mm). the dna sequences of rpob genes in arr-2 negative isolate showed mutations l904s, p906r, k909n and m1262k that might have roles in  rifampin resistance. mutations of rpob genes in some isolates and possession of arr-2 in class 1 integron element were mechanisms for rifampin resistance and these resistant determinants can disseminate through both vertical and horizontal gene transfer. under this circumstance, it is not recommended to use rifampin in  the treatment of carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii in thailand.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli in german intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008.
AB  == introduction: the objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (icus). methods: the study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 german icus from 2001 through 2008. data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (ad) expressed as daily defined doses (ddd) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. results: total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 ddd/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). carbapenem use almost doubled to an ad of 151 in 2008. significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (ad of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (ad of 117 in 2008). aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (ad of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 26% and 20% (p = 0.006; trend  test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (p = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)-resistant escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (p < 0.001), 3gc-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (p < 0.001), imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (p = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant k. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. the resistance densities did not change for mrsa but increased significantly for vre  faecium and 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. in 2008, the resistance density for mrsa was 3.73, 0.48 for vre, 1.39 for 3gc-resistant e. coli and 0.82  for k. pneumoniae. conclusions: although total antibiotic use did not change over time in german icus, carbapenem use doubled. this is probably due to the rise in  3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia: role of colonizers and value of routine endotracheal aspirate cultures.
AB  == objectives: to determine the role of colonizers in the causation of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and the value of routine pre-vap endotracheal aspirate (ea) cultures in appropriately treating vap. methods: a prospective observational cohort study was conducted over a period of 15 months.  two hundred patients on mechanical ventilation for>48h were studied. results: acinetobacter spp (33.7%) and pseudomonas spp (29.8%) were the most common colonizers. of the 200 patients, 36 developed vap. in 20 vap patients, the pre-vap ea culture-based strategy was not useful. however, in the remaining 16 vap patients, a pre-vap ea culture-based strategy would have appropriately treated 13 (81%; 95% confidence interval (ci) 62-100%), in comparison to only nine (56%; 95% ci 32-80%) by the american thoracic society (ats) strategy. the seven patients in whom the ats guidelines were inappropriate had acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas spp resistant to the higher antibiotics recommended by the ats for multidrug-resistant pathogens. the positive predictive values of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolated from pre-vap ea cultures were 88%, 83%, and 100%, respectively. conclusion: vap patients should be treated based on ats guidelines, but whenever p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii, and mrsa are isolated from  pre-vap ea cultures, the initial antibiotic therapy should be extended to treat these.

TI  == frequent multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii contamination of gloves, gowns, and hands of healthcare workers.
AB  == background: multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacilli are important nosocomial pathogens. objective: to determine the incidence of transmission of mdr acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients to healthcare workers (hcws) during routine patient care. design: prospective cohort study. setting: medical and surgical intensive care units. methods. we observed hcws who entered the rooms of patients colonized with mdr a. baumannii or colonized with both mdr a. baumannii and mdr p. aeruginosa. we examined their hands before room entry, their disposable gloves and/or gowns upon completion of  patient care, and their hands after removal of gloves and/or gowns and before hand hygiene. results: sixty-five interactions occurred with patients colonized with mdr a. baumannii and 134 with patients colonized with both mdr a. baumannii  and mdr p. aeruginosa. of 199 interactions between hcws and patients colonized with mdr a. baumannii, 77 (38.7% [95% confidence interval {ci}, 31.9%-45.5%]) resulted in hcw contamination of gloves and/or gowns, and 9 (4.5% [95% ci, 1.6%-7.4%]) resulted in contamination of hcw hands after glove removal before hand hygiene. of 134 interactions with patients colonized with mdr p. aeruginosa, 11 (8.2% [95% ci, 3.6%-12.9%]) resulted in hcw contamination of gloves and/or gowns, and 1 resulted in hcw contamination of hands. independent risk factors for contamination with mdr a. baumannii were manipulation of wound dressing (adjusted odds ratio [aor], 25.9 [95% ci, 3.1-208.8]), manipulation of artificial airway (aor, 2.1 [95% ci, 1.1-4.0]), time in room longer than 5 minutes (aor, 4.3 [95% ci, 2.0-9.1]), being a physician or nurse practitioner (aor, 7.4 [95% ci, 1.6-35.2]), and being a nurse (aor, 2.3 [95% ci, 1.1-4.8]). conclusions: gowns, gloves, and unwashed hands of hcws were frequently contaminated with mdr a. baumannii. mdr a. baumannii appears to be more easily transmitted than mdr p. aeruginosa and perhaps more easily transmitted than previously studied methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. this ease of transmission may help explain the emergence of mdr a. baumannii.

TI  == bactericidal performance of visible-light responsive titania photocatalyst with silver nanostructures.
AB  == background: titania dioxide (tio(2)) photocatalyst is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. visible-light responsive anion-doped tio(2) photocatalysts contain higher quantum efficiency under sunlight and can be used safely in indoor settings without exposing to biohazardous ultraviolet light. the antibacterial efficiency, however, remains to be further improved. methodology/principal findings: using thermal reduction method, here we synthesized silver-nanostructures coated tio(2) thin films that contain a high visible-light responsive antibacterial property. among our tested titania substrates including tio(2), carbon-doped tio(2) [tio(2) (c)] and nitrogen-doped  tio(2) [tio(2) (n)], tio(2) (n) showed the best performance after silver coating. the synergistic antibacterial effect results approximately 5 log reductions of surviving bacteria of escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii. scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that crystalline silver formed unique wire-like nanostructures on tio(2) (n) substrates, while formed relatively straight and thicker rod-shaped precipitates on the other two titania materials. conclusion/significance: our results suggested that proper forms of silver on various titania materials could  further influence the bactericidal property.

TI  == the global problem of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == amid the recent attention justly focused on the potential problem of microbial sources for weapons of bioterrorism, it is also apparent that human pathogens frequently isolated from infections in patients from community and hospital sources have been growing more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. much of the growth of multiple-drug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens can be contributed to the overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial products. however, an  equally troubling and often overlooked component of the problem involves the elegant ways in which pathogenic bacteria continually evolve complex genetic systems for acquiring and regulating an endless array of antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. efforts to develop new antimicrobials have over the past two decades  been woefully behind the rapid evolution of resistance genes developing among both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. several new agents that are best  suited for use in the hospital environment have been developed to combat staphylococci resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobials following acquisition of the meca gene. however, the dramatic spread in the us of the now common community strain of staphylococcus aureus usa300 has shifted the therapeutic need for new antibiotics useful against mrsa to the community. as the pharmaceutical industry  focused on discovering new agents for use against mrsa, hospitals in many parts of the world have seen the emergence of gram-negative pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae that are clinically resistant to almost all available antimicrobials. such mdr isolates usually contain multiple-resistance determinants, including loss of outer membrane porins via gene inactivation by chromosomally encoded insertion sequences, up-regulation of inate efflux pumps, as well as acquisition of drug-inactivating enzymes whose genes are encoded on self-transmissible plasmids, integrons, and complex transposable elements. these determinants confer a complex resistance phenotype that is often superimposed on mutations in the primary drug  target in the cell. the continued evolution of such a complex array of antibiotic-resistance genes presents a formidable challenge at a time when large  pharmaceutical companies have scaled down their presence in the anti-infectives arena.

AB  == background: in developing countries, knowledge of antimicrobial resistance patterns is essential to define empirical therapy. methodology: all the surgery and intensive care wards of two hospitals in antananarivo were included to study  the antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogenic bacteria causing nosocomial infections. a repeated cross-sectional survey was conducted between september 2006 and march 2008, one day per week. isolates were identified using classical methods, and resistance to antibiotics was assessed according to the recommendations of the antibiogram committee of the french microbiology society.  results: clinical specimens from 706 from 651 patients were collected. of the 533 bacterial pathogens, 46.7% were enterobacteriaceae, 19.3% were staphylococcus aureus, and 19.1% were pathogens from the hospital environment (pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii).frequencies of resistance were high, particularly in enterobacteriaceae; however, the rate of staphylococcus aureus isolates resistant to oxacillin (13.6 %) was moderate and all these isolates were susceptible to glycopeptids. the percentages of isolates susceptible to ceftazidim were 81.8% for e. coli, 60.9% for klebsiella, and 52.5% for enterobacter spp. resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was due to extended spectrum betalactamases (esbl). multivariate analysis showed that diabetes (adjusted or: 3.9) and use of an invasive procedures (adjusted or: 3.5)  were independent risk factors for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins.  conclusion: a nationwide surveillance programme is needed to monitor the microbial trends and antimicrobial resistance in madagascar.

TI  == synergy of fosfomycin with other antibiotics for gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == background: the alarming increase in drug resistance and decreased production of  new antibiotics necessitate the evaluation of combinations of existing antibiotics. fosfomycin shows no cross-resistance to other antibiotic classes. thus, its combination with other antibiotics may potentially show synergy against resistant bacteria. objective: to evaluate the available published evidence regarding the in vitro synergistic activity of fosfomycin with other antibiotic agents against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: pubmed and the  cochrane library were searched. results: forty-one studies, including 34 (82.9%)  conducted/published before 2000, were eligible for inclusion. the relatively limited number of isolates examined and the considerable heterogeneity of the retrieved studies regarding the definitions of synergy and the methodologies used hamper conclusive remarks for specific combinations of fosfomycin with other antibiotics. yet, in the 27 studies providing data for gram-positive strains (16  for staphylococcus aureus, 3 for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 5 for streptococcus pneumoniae, and 3 for enterococcus spp.), fosfomycin showed synergy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus when combined with cefamandole, cephazolin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and rifampicin. data regarding gram-negative strains reported from 15 studies (12 exclusively for p. aeruginosa, 2 exclusively for enterobacteriaceae, 1 for both, and 1 for acinetobacter baumannii) suggested that fosfomycin showed an estimable synergistic effect with gentamicin, amikacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam against p. aeruginosa. conclusions: the synergistic combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics may be a useful  alternative treatment option for gram-negative and gram-positive infections. additional studies using more stringent definitions of synergy, and studies reporting on the clinical efficacy of fosfomycin combinations in the current era  of high antimicrobial resistance are needed.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (hap). the trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in hap, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of mics </=2 microg/ml for the entire collection). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, and enterobacter cloacae. as reported previously, a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and the proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. the excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms recovered at a military burn center.
AB  == infections caused by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with burn injuries. we performed  a 6-year antibiotic susceptibility records review from january 2003 to december 2008 to assess the prevalence of mdr isolates by pathogen at the us army institute of surgical research burn center. during the study period acinetobacter baumannii (780 isolates [22%]) was the most prevalent organism recovered, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (703 isolates [20%]), klebsiella pneumoniae (695 isolates [20%]), and staphylococcus aureus (469 isolates [13%]). mdr prevalence rates among these isolates were a. baumannii 53%, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) 34%, k. pneumoniae 17% and p. aeruginosa 15%. two isolates, 1 a. baumannii and 1 p. aeruginosa, were identified as resistant to all 4 classes of antibiotics tested plus colistin. a. baumannii isolates recovered from patients with burns greater than 30% of total body surface area (tbsa) were more likely to be mdr (61%) with no significant difference for p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. a higher proportion of mdr p. aeruginosa isolates were recovered from respiratory specimens compared to blood specimens (24% vs. 9%) while the opposite was true for mrsa (35% vs. 54%). a comparison of a. baumannii recovered during hospitalization days 1-5 and 15-30 revealed higher mdr levels as length of stay increased (48% vs. 75%) while no significant trends were observed for p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. a similar pattern was observed for mdr a. baumannii levels for the facility between 2003 and 2005 and 2006-2008 (39% vs. 70%), with no significant increase in mdr p. aeruginosa and mdr k. pneumoniae. increasing antibiotic resistance patterns of the most prevalent isolates recovered during extended hospitalization, impact of  % tbsa and other clinical parameters may affect empirical antimicrobial therapy and patient management decisions during treatment.

AB  == the discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. these discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. however, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. in this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.

AB  == pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacilli is associated with a higher mortality rate. the appropriate empiric therapy is based on the understanding of local etiology and mdr pattern. this study was to evaluate the spectrum of gram-negative bacilli, mdr rate, risk factors and mortality in 475 liver transplantation (lt) recipients. in the first six months after lt, the incidence of bacterial pneumonia was 21.3% (101/475). the overall infectious incidence during the first post-transplant month was 80.2%. the most frequent pneumonia isolates were enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. gram-negative bacilli accounted for 69.6% of all pneumonia pathogens. of the main 124 gram-negative bacilli isolates, mdr rate was 58.9%. four risk factors for post-lt pneumonia caused by mdr gram-negative bacilli were lt candidates with grade ii-iv encephalopathy (or 2.275, 95%ci 1.249-4.124, p = 0.006), prolonged duration of endotracheal intubation (or 8.224, 95%ci 4.276-15.815, p = 0.013), tracheostomy (or 4.929, 95%ci 1.099-18.308, p = 0.027) and post-lt episode(s) of reoperations (or 10.597, 95%ci 3.726-30.134, p < 0.001). mdr gram-negative bacterial pneumonia-related mortality was significantly higher than that because of antibiotic-susceptible bacilli (45.6% vs. 11.4%, p = 0.010). our data suggest that pneumonia caused by mdr gram-negative bacilli after lt is common, and associated with the severity of underlying disease, prolonged mechanical ventilation and upper abdominal surgery.

TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection is correlated with the severity of h1n1 pandemic influenza.
AB  == background: initial reports in may 2009 of the novel influenza strain h1n1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (cfr) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. in july 2009, however, argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths,  representing a cfr of 4.5%. potential explanations for increased cfr included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. virus genomic sequencing of 26 argentinian samples representing both  severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for h1n1pdm disease. methods/principal findings: we examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (nps) from 199 cases of h1n1pdm infection from argentina with masstag pcr, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. the  study population consisted of 199 h1n1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 june and 4 july 2009. thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. at least one additional agent of  potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus a (n = 11) and b (n = 1); human rhinovirus a (n = 1)  and b (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229e (n = 1) and oc43 (n = 2); klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); serratia marcescens (n = 1); and staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n = 6). the presence of s. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. s. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of h1n1pdm nps with s. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 s. pneumoniae-positive nps, p = 0.0004). in subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (or) of severe disease in the presence of s. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [ci], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001).  conclusions/significance: the association of s. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. however, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of s. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.

TI  == new antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  == the optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. we herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections. the newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae infections. tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections  caused by enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), or multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.

TI  == [update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  == there is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics  in clinical practice. as observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. for instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. in fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium). therefore, multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for gram-positive infections. this review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in france (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).

TI  == synthetic {beta}-(1->6)-linked n-acetylated and nonacetylated oligoglucosamines used to produce conjugate vaccines for bacterial pathogens.
AB  == vaccines for pathogens usually target strain-specific surface antigens or toxins, and rarely is there broad antigenic specificity extending across multiple species. protective antibodies for bacteria are usually specific for surface or capsular antigens. beta-(1-->6)-poly-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (pnag) is a surface polysaccharide produced by many pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, yersinia pestis, bordetella pertussis, acinetobacter baumannii, and others. protective antibodies to pnag are elicited when a deacetylated glycoform (deacetylated pnag [dpnag]; <30% acetate) is used in conjugate vaccines, whereas highly acetylated pnag does not induce such antibodies. chemical derivation of dpnag from native pnag is imprecise, so we synthesized both beta-(1-->6)-d-glucosamine (glcnh(2)) and beta-(1-->6)-d-n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) oligosaccharides with linkers on the reducing termini that could be activated to produce sulfhydryl groups for conjugation to bromoacetyl groups introduced onto carrier proteins. synthetic 5-mer glcnh(2) (5glcnh(2)) or 9glcnh(2) conjugated to tetanus toxoid (tt) elicited mouse antibodies that mediated opsonic killing of multiple s. aureus strains, while the antibodies that were produced in response to 5glcnac- or 9glcnac-tt did not mediate opsonic killing. rabbit antibodies to 9glcnh(2)-tt bound to pnag and dpnag antigens, mediated killing of s. aureus and e. coli, and protected against s. aureus skin abscesses and lethal e. coli peritonitis. chemical synthesis of a series of oligoglucosamine ligands with defined differences in n acetylation allowed us to  identify a conjugate vaccine formulation that generated protective immune responses to two of the most challenging bacterial pathogens. this vaccine could  potentially be used to engender protective immunity to the broad range of pathogens that produce surface pnag.

TI  == use of automated repetitive-sequence-based pcr for rapid laboratory confirmation  of nosocomial outbreaks.
AB  == objective: rapid and reliable diagnosis of genetic relatedness of clinical isolates in microbiologic laboratory is essential in case of nosocomial outbreak  investigation. most molecular techniques used to type microorganisms are technically demanding and time consuming. currently repetitive-sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) technique has been adapted to an automated format on the diversilab system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). aim of this study was to compare the performance of the diversilab system to that of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  (pfge) in nosocomial outbreaks. methods: 122 clinical isolates (28 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 26 acinetobacter baumannii, 45 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca) were investigated. 70 isolates originated from six well-documented outbreaks, 52 were non-outbreak isolates. results: concordant results for identification of outbreak and non-outbreak mrsa, a. baumannii and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae strains were achieved with both methods. in the outbreak of esbl-producing k. oxytoca automated rep-pcr was slightly more discriminatory than pfge. rep-pcr identified investigated esbl-producing k. oxytoca outbreak-strains as indistinguishable or closely related, showing similarity of >90%, while pfge identified these strains as indistinguishable. conclusion: automated rep-pcr assays on the diversilab system were used for mrsa, a. baumannii and for the first time esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and proved as  a rapid and reliable method for molecular analysis of nosocomial outbreaks.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == in vitro effect of physiological concentrations of human albumin on the antibacterial activity of tigecycline.
AB  == objectives: to determine c(max) tigecycline activity in the presence/absence of physiological concentrations of human albumin with free fraction concentrations as controls. methods: killing curves (final inoculum: 1.0-5.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml) were performed with 0.88 mg/l final concentrations (serum c(max) after a 100 mg 1 h infusion) in mueller-hinton broth supplemented with ca(2+) and mg(2+) (mh) and  in mh with 4 g/dl human albumin. controls were curves in mh with concentrations similar to the free fraction (fc(max) = 0.17 mg/l) calculated using protein binding. activity was measured as log(10) initial inoculum reduction (log(10) initial inoculum-log(10) at 12 h/24 h). target strains (tigecycline mic/mbc; mg/l) were: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus heteroresistant to vancomycin (0.12/0.25); enterococcus faecium (0.12/0.25); escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (0.12/0.25); and acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/1). results: at 24 h the fc(max) produced mean decreases of < or  =0.1 cfu/ml for all strains, in contrast to the bactericidal activity (mean >3 log(10) reduction) provided by c(max) concentrations in the presence or absence of albumin for e. coli and e. faecium, and an activity nearly bactericidal for s. aureus (mean approximately 2.8 log(10) reduction). in the case of the a. baumannii isolate the c(max) in the presence or absence of albumin produced a mean reduction of 2.56 log(10) cfu/ml at 12 h (time of one dosing interval), with a bacteriostatic profile when considering 24 h colony counts (similar counts at 0 and 24 h). conclusions: correcting the total concentration for the reported literature binding values is unreliable since tigecycline antibacterial activity  was greater than that suggested by the free fraction of the drug.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in community-acquired pneumonia caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of management for community-acquired pneumonia (cap). accordingly, the choices of treatment are influenced by the likely etiologies, local resistance patterns of the pathogens, as well as patient factors. as the leading cause of acute cap, the susceptibility patterns of streptococcus pneumoniae have greatly influenced antimicrobial agents and dosage  recommended for empirical treatment of this condition. the worldwide emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus has also led to discussion of this pathogen in recent revisions of the international cap guidelines. this pathogen is important because of its resistance to antibiotics commonly recommended for the empirical treatment of cap and the association with  a rapidly fatal form of pneumonia characterized by tissue necrosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and rapid progression to respiratory failure. in tropical regions of  australia and asia, cap due to acinetobacter baumannii is also increasingly recognized. this review discusses their recent epidemiology, microbiology, clinical features, and treatment of cap caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii on computer interface surfaces of hospital wards and association with clinical isolates.
AB  == background: computer keyboards and mice are potential reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens, but routine disinfection for non-water-proof computer devices is a problem. with better hand hygiene compliance of health-care workers (hcws), the impact of these potential sources of contamination on clinical infection needs to be clarified. methods: this study was conducted in a 1600-bed medical center of southern taiwan with 47 wards and 282 computers. with education and monitoring program of hand hygiene for hcws, the average compliance rate was 74% before our  surveillance. we investigated the association of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, three leading hospital-acquired pathogens, from ward computer keyboards, mice and from clinical isolates in non-outbreak period by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and antibiogram. results: our results revealed a 17.4% (49/282) contamination rate of these computer devices by s. aureus, acinetobacter spp. or pseudomonas spp. the contamination rates of mrsa and a. baumannii in the ward computers were  1.1% and 4.3%, respectively. no p. aeruginosa was isolated. all isolates from computers and clinical specimens at the same ward showed different pulsotypes. however, a. baumannii isolates on two ward computers had the same pulsotype. conclusion: with good hand hygiene compliance, we found relatively low contamination rates of mrsa, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii on ward computer interface, and without further contribution to nosocomial infection. our results  suggested no necessity of routine culture surveillance in non-outbreak situation.

TI  == [is pneumatic sample transport system also a carrier for microorganisms?].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible infection and contamination risk of the pneumatic system used in our hospital and to establish  essential infection control measures. the study was conducted in a quaternary health care center with 1.000 bed capacity. a total of 614 specimens were taken 2 times weekly from the pneumatic transport system and its carriers at 22 wards, 5  intensive care units, 3 laboratories, 2 blood taking units, and pharmacy. samples were also obtained from the fingertips of 33 subjects using the system, before and after contact with the carriers. a questionnaire that consisted of 8 questions was applied to 224 subjects who worked in those units, evaluating the degree of compliance to the obligations for the cleaning of the pneumatic system  and carriers and their approach in case of visible pollution at the system. bacterial growth was observed in 15.2% (45/296) of samples in the 1st week and 7.6% (18/238) of the samples in the 2nd week, making a total of 11.8% (63/534) bacterial growth. no growth was detected from the areas where the carriers were placed. of these 69.8% were coagulase negative staphylococci, 11.1% diphteroids,  7.9% acinetobacter iwoffii, 4.8% staphylococcus aureus, 4.8% bacillus spp. and 1.6% enterococcus durans. acinetobacter baumannii and aspergillus were detected at two fingertip samples taken before the contact with carriers, while again a. baumannii and enterobacter cloacae were detected at the samples following contact. moreover, 31.3% of the subjects noted that they cleaned the carriers only if any visible contamination was present. in addition, 14.3% reported that they have encountered broken or spilled up material in the system for more than 5 times, 10.3% reported that they followed the instructions in case of presence of  infected material inside the carriers, 23.7% reported that they always washed their hands after any contact with the carriers, 9.8% noted that they always used gloves during contact with the system. of the subjects 73.7% declared that they had no information about cleaning and decontamination procedures related to the system. these data revealed that the pneumatic system used in our hospital carried contamination risk and the rules for hygiene and disinfection regarding the pneumatic transport system has to be determined, implemented and checked in order to establish appropriate infection control measures.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of brevinin-2-related peptide and its analogs: efficacy  against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == brevinin-2 related peptide (b2rp; giwdtiksmg(10)kvfagkilqn(20)l.nh(2)), first isolated from skin secretions of the mink frog lithobates septentrionalis, shows  broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity but its therapeutic potential is limited by moderate hemolytic activity. the peptide adopts an alpha-helical conformation in  a membrane-mimetic solvent but amphipathicity is low. increasing amphipathicity together with hydrophobicity by the substitutions lys(16)-->leu and lys(16)-->ala increased hemolytic activity approximately fivefold without increasing antimicrobial potency. the substitution leu(18)-->lys increased both cationicity  and amphipathicity but produced decreases in both antimicrobial potency and hemolytic activity. in contrast, increasing cationicity of b2rp without changing  amphipathicity by the substitution asp(4)-->lys resulted in a fourfold increase in potency against escherichia coli [minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) = 6 microm) and twofold increases in potency against staphylococcus aureus (mic = 12.5 microm) and candida albicans (mic = 6 microm) without changing significantly hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (lc(50) = 95 microm). the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of the gram-negative bacterium acinetobacter baumannii constitutes a serious risk to public health. b2rp (mic = 3-6 microm) and [lys(4)]b2rp (mic = 1.5-3 microm) potently inhibited the growth of nosocomial isolates of multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. although the analogs [lys(4), lys(18)]b2rp and [lys(4), ala(16), lys(18)]b2rp showed reduced potency against staphylococcus aureus, they retained activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic = 3-6 microm) and had very low hemolytic activity (lc(50) > 200 microm).

TI  == non-adherence to guidelines: an avoidable cause of failure of empirical antimicrobial therapy in the presence of difficult-to-treat bacteria.
AB  == purpose: to identify the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) due to difficult-to-treat (dtt) bacteria (i.e., pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), and to assess the rate and the causes of inappropriateness of empirical antimicrobial therapy. methods: in an intensive care unit of a university hospital, patients with vap were empirically treated with antibiotics without activity against dtt bacteria if the patients had no prior hospitalization or prior administration of  antibiotics, according to local guidelines. results: overall, the empirical antimicrobial therapy was appropriate in 190 (87%) out of 218 patients with vap.  fifty (23%) patients developed problems due to dtt bacteria. the risk factors for vap due to dtt bacteria were shock state, prior antimicrobial therapy, prior stay in long-term care facilities and late-onset vap. empirical antimicrobial therapy  was inappropriate in 20 (40%) patients with vap due to dtt bacteria and 8 (5%) patients with vap due to non-dtt (p = 0.001). guidelines violations (nine patients), bacteria not included in antibiotic spectrum (eight patients) and bacterial resistance (three patients) were the causes of inappropriateness in case of dtt bacteria. conclusion: despite the abundant information for the treatment of vap and the establishment of guidelines, too many patients with dtt  bacteria received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. since 45% of the cases are related to non-adherence to the local protocol, there is room for improvement by  implementing educational programs. also, since dtt bacteria are found in 23% of late-onset vap, empirical antibiotic treatment should be directed against these pathogens.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

TI  == description of streptococcus pneumoniae infections in burn patients.
AB  == background: longer survival in burn patients has resulted in more infectious complications, typically with klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and staphylococcus aureus. although streptococcus pneumoniae infections are common in the community and can cause nosocomial infections, the incidence and risk factors for pneumococcal infections in burn patients is unclear. methods: we performed an electronic retrospective chart review to collect rates of and risk factors for s. pneumoniae infections in patients with thermal burns from march 2003 through june 2008. results: of the 1838 patients admitted to the burn center, 10 were infected (0.54% incidence). patients presented with pneumonia (seven patients, 0.38% incidence) and bacteremia (three patients, 0.16% incidence) within a week of initial burn (median 1 day, range 0-8), often in the setting of bacterial co-infection (five patients). this group was mainly young males with median 28.8% total body surface area burns; 60% had concomitant inhalational injury. most did not have traditional risk factors for pneumococcal infection but had objective signs of infection at time of positive culture and were treated with appropriate antibiotics. two patients in this series died, although no mortality was attributed to s. pneumoniae. conclusions: pneumococcal disease is not common in burn patients and generally occurs early on in hospitalization after burn making  it more likely to be a community-acquired pathogen rather than nosocomial in the  burn population. it should be considered in the setting of sepsis or new pulmonary infiltrates within a week after burn, but typical empiric antibiotics against the usual burn pathogens should be adequate to also treat for pneumococcal infection.

AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. against gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline mic(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for pseudomonas aeruginosa). against gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline mic(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant a. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli  (7.0%) and k. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing h. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (45.9%)  and e. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (13.8%). tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult  to treat organisms.

TI  == the clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == the continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat  serious infections. the major success of the seven-valent streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. the almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of ctx-m beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the  united states, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanni, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.

TI  == [quantitative culture sampling of tracheal aspirates for diagnosis of nosocomial  pneumonia in the itu].
AB  == background: nosocomial pneumonia is defined as a pneumonia developing within 48 hours of admission, in a patient with previously normal lung tissue. ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) due to migration of microorganisms from the nose, throat and digestive tract is typical in itu patients. microbiological diagnosis is difficult, and there is no single method approved for vap diagnosis. we have assessed the usefulness of quantitative endotracheal aspirate (qeta) for  this purpose, basing on its reported high sensitivity (mean 76% +/- 9%) and specificity (mean 75 +/- 28%). methods: endotracheal aspirates were sampled from  itu patients fulfilling the following criteria: (1) new or progressive infiltrations in the lungs plus hyperthermia (>38.3 degrees c) or hypothermia (<36 degrees c); (2) leukocytosis (>12 g l(-1)) or leukopenia (<4 g l(-1)); or (3) purulent sputum. results: nosocomial pneumonia was diagnosed in 40 out of 312 patients treated in the itu during the study period. vap was diagnosed in 33 patients. multi-drug resistant bacteria: pseudomonas aeruginosa (16), acinetobacter baumannii (19), esbl pathogens (8) and mrsa (1) were cultured from  qeta in 32 patients. the sensitivity of qeta was 86%. conclusion: the results allowed for early and accurate diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia and institution  of the best possible treatment.

TI  == accuracy of american thoracic society/infectious diseases society of america criteria in predicting infection or colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria at intensive-care unit admission.
AB  == the aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the accuracy of  american thoracic society (ats)/infectious diseases society of america (idsa) criteria in predicting infection or colonization related to multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria at intensive-care unit (icu) admission. mdr bacteria were defined  as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime-resistant or imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli. screening for mdr bacteria (using nasal and rectal swabs and tracheal aspirates from intubated patients) was performed at icu admission. risk factors for infection or colonization with mdr bacteria at icu admission were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. the accuracy of ats/idsa criteria in predicting infection or colonization with these bacteria at  icu admission was calculated. eighty-three (13%) of 625 patients were infected or colonized with mdr bacteria at icu admission. multivariate analysis allowed identification of prior antimicrobial treatment (or 2.3, 95% ci 1.2-4.3; p 0.008), residence in a nursing home (or 2, 95% ci 1.1-3.7; p <0.001), and prior hospitalization (or 3.9, 95% ci 1.7-8.8; p <0.001) as independent predictors of infection or colonization with mdr bacteria at icu admission. although sensitivity (89%) and negative predictive values (96%) were high, low specificity (39%) and a positive predictive value (18%) were found when ats/idsa criteria were used in predicting infection or colonization with mdr bacteria at icu admission. in patients with pneumonia, adherence to guidelines was associated with increased rates of appropriate initial antibiotic treatment and de-escalation. ats/idsa criteria had an excellent negative predictive value and a low positive predictive value concerning infection or colonization with mdr bacteria at icu admission.

TI  == has the era of untreatable infections arrived?
AB  == antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern, with fears expressed that we shortly will run out of antibiotics. in reality, the picture is more mixed, improving against some pathogens but worsening against others. against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)--the highest profile pathogen--the range of treatment options is expanding, with daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline all launched, and telavancin, ceftobiprole, ceftaroline and dalbavancin anticipated. there is a greater problem with enterococci, especially  if, as in endocarditis, bactericidal activity is needed and the isolate has high-level aminoglycoside resistance; nevertheless, daptomycin, telavancin and razupenem all offer cidal potential. against enterobacteriaceae, the rapid and disturbing spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, ampc enzymes and quinolone resistance is forcing increased reliance on carbapenems, with resistance to these slowly accumulating via the spread of metallo-, kpc and oxa-48 beta-lactamases. future options overcoming some of these mechanisms include various novel beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations, but none of these overcomes all the carbapenemase types now circulating. multiresistance that includes carbapenems is much commoner in non-fermenters than in the enterobacteriaceae, depending mostly on oxa carbapenemases in acinetobacter baumannii and on combinations of chromosomal mutation in pseudomonas aeruginosa.  no agent in advanced development has much to offer here, though there is interest in modified, less-toxic, polymyxin derivatives and in the siderophore monobactam  bal30072, which has impressive activity against a. baumannii and members of the burkholderia cepacia complex. a final and surprising problem is neisseria gonorrhoeae, where each good oral agent has been eroded in turn and where there is now little in reserve behind the oral oxyimino cephalosporins, to which low-level resistance is emerging.

TI  == antibiotic considerations in the treatment of multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens: a case-based review.
AB  == the recent rise in antimicrobial resistance among health-care associated pathogens is a growing public health concern. according to the national nosocomial infections surveillance system, rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in intensive care units have nearly doubled over the last decade. of equal importance, gram-negative agents such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae demonstrate increasing resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and, in some cases, carbapenems. as a consequence, hospitalists may find themselves utilizing new antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections. this case-based review will highlight 8 antibiotics that have emerging clinical indications in treating these multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens.

TI  == minocycline--an old drug for a new century: emphasis on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the epidemiology of nosocomial and community-acquired infections has changed in recent years. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), especially community-associated mrsa (ca-mrsa), has emerged as a gram-positive organism with an increasing impact in clinical practice. infections with acinetobacter baumannii have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality. minocycline has significant in vitro activity against mrsa and a. baumannii that is comparable with agents currently used against these organisms. the absence of an intravenous (i.v.) minocycline formulation in recent years has limited its use in seriously ill patients infected with these organisms. however, minocycline i.v. has recently been reintroduced to the us market. the objective of this study was to review available information on the chemistry, mechanism of action, in vitro activity, resistance mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, tolerability and efficacy of minocycline against mrsa and a. baumannii. this article provides suggestions for  future studies and potential uses of minocycline and is designed to trigger interest in systematic clinical evaluation of minocycline for patients infected with these organisms. in conclusion, minocycline is an old drug that has the potential to become an important part of the armamentarium against emerging infections such as ca-mrsa and a. baumannii. owing to its promising profile against these clinically important pathogens as well as excellent pharmacokinetic properties, minocycline merits evaluation in serious infections.

TI  == intra-abdominal infections: etiology, epidemiology, microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iais) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  the etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable  and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired iais enterobacteria predominate (mostly escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly bacteroides fragilis). in nosocomial iais, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and candida spp. diagnostic microbiology of iais is complex and plays a relevant role, especially in some situations (e.g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing iais. resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.

TI  == detection of enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a dna microarray.
AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == carbapenems and subsequent multiresistant bloodstream infection: does treatment duration matter?
AB  == it has been proposed that initial empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy will result in better clinical outcomes and that shorter courses will reduce the  'collateral damage' of promoting antibiotic resistance. there are few data from intensive care units (icus) that support this latter conclusion. a prospective observational study was undertaken at the national university hospital, singapore, to examine the relationship between duration of carbapenem therapy and subsequent nosocomial multidrug-resistant (mdr) bloodstream infection (bsi). over a 2-year period, 415 icu patients receiving empirical carbapenem therapy were prospectively followed. mdr bsi occurred on 35 occasions in 31 patients, comprising 21 carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, 3 carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and 11 meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). there was no difference in the duration of carbapenems for those who developed mdr bsi compared with those who did not [median duration 8 days (range 3-23 days) vs. 9 days (range 3-59 days); p=0.78].  on multivariate analysis using the cox proportional hazard model the hazard ratio was 0.935 (p=0.070). in this cohort of critically ill patients, a shorter duration of carbapenem therapy was not shown to protect against subsequent development of mdr bsi. strategies that depend primarily on reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic duration may be inadequate in preventing the emergence  of mdr organisms.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance patterns of pathogens causing hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (lrtis) in shandong province, china were investigated using data collected from january 2002 to december 2006. a total of  10 337 isolates were characterized in sputum samples from 39 920 lrti patients: 68.72% were gram-negative bacteria, 20.65% were gram-positive bacteria, and 10.62% were fungi. organisms most frequently isolated were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.88%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.80%), escherichia coli (10.71%), fungi (10.62%), staphylococcus aureus (9.68%) and acinetobacter baumannii (9.03%). imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against gram-negative bacteria. most gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to vancomycin. susceptibility to cephalosporins was not optimal and resistance to fluoroquinolones was high. resistance of gram-negative bacteria showed a rapid increase over the study period, while resistance of gram-positive bacteria remained relatively stable. the emergence of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents used against lrti pathogens has compounded the problem of using empirical therapy and created selective pressure on physicians to use certain antibiotics.

TI  == mixture model to assess the extent of cross-transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens in hospitals.
AB  == objective: creation of a mixture model based on poisson processes for assessment  of the extent of cross-transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens in the hospital. methods: we propose a 2-component mixture of poisson processes to describe the time series of detected cases of colonization. the first component describes the admission process of patients with colonization, and the second describes the cross-transmission. the data set used to illustrate the method consists of the routinely collected records for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii over a period of 3 years in a german  tertiary care hospital. results: for mrsa and multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cross-transmission was estimated to be responsible for more than 80% of cases; for imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, cross-transmission was estimated to be responsible for 59% of cases. for new cases observed within a window of less than 28 days for mrsa and multidrug-resistant a. baumannii or 40 days for imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, there was a 50% or greater probability that the cause was cross-transmission. conclusions: the proposed method offers a solution  to assessing of the extent of cross-transmission, which can be of clinical use. the method can be applied using freely available software (the package flexmix in r) and it requires relatively little data.

TI  == advances in antibacterial therapy against emerging bacterial pathogens.
AB  == during the last decade, both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to most or all available antibacterial classes have become increasingly prevalent nosocomial pathogens, particularly among immunocompromised patients and those hospitalized in intensive care units. among gram-positive bacteria, increasing concerns are posed for health care- and community-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), s aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). a spectrum of newer antibacterial agents has been developed for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, and novel glycopeptides. gram-negative bacteria have also developed multidrug resistance (mdr), which in the enterobacteriacae is commonly due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases of vim, imp, or kpc types. currently, non-fermenting bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii are commonly resistant to all available antibiotics,  including the newer agents. colistin retains activity against most p aeruginosa and a baumannii, but its clinical use remains questionable, while newer carbapenems and tigecycline have limited additional advantages. rational use of newer antibacterial agents coupled with enhanced infection control measures may be able to sufficiently control mdr organisms as to allow hematological patients  to recover from serious infectious complications.

AB  == objectives: information on clinical practice regarding the diagnosis of pneumonia in european intensive care units is limited. the aim of this study was to describe the spectrum of actual diagnostic practices in a large sample of european intensive care units. design: prospective, observational, multicenter study. setting: twenty-seven intensive care units of nine european countries. patients: consecutive patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for an admission diagnosis of pneumonia or receiving mechanical ventilation for >48 hrs  irrespective of admission diagnosis. interventions: none. measurements and main results: a total of 2,436 patients were evaluated; 827 were admitted with or developed nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia [hap], 27.1%; ventilator-associated pneumonia [vap], 56.2%; very early onset vap, 16.7%). mean  age was 59.4 +/- 18.1 yrs, 65.0% were men, and mean admission simplified acute physiology score ii was 46.7 +/- 17.1. worsening oxygenation (76.8%), purulent/changing respiratory secretions (72.1%), and new temperature elevation (69.2%) were the most frequent clinical signs of nosocomial pneumonia. etiological diagnosis was based on noninvasive respiratory specimens in 74.8% of  episodes. bronchoscopy was performed in 23.3% of episodes. bronchoscopy performance, after adjustment by severity of illness, age, and type of hospital,  were predicted by worsening oxygenation (odds ratio 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-3.24) and male sex (odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.65). definite cause was documented in 69.5% of nosocomial pneumonia cases. the most common isolates were staphylococcus aureus (16.3% methicillin-sensitive  s. aureus and 16.0% methicillin-resistant s. aureus), pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), and acinetobacter baumannii (19.1%). presence of nosocomial pneumonia significantly prolonged mean length of mechanical ventilation (10.3 days, p < .05) and mean intensive care unit length of stay (12.2 days, p < .05) in intensive care unit survivors. mortality rate was 37.7% for nosocomial pneumonia  vs. 31.6% for patients without pneumonia (p < .05). conclusions: etiological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in a large sample of european intensive care units was based mainly on noninvasive techniques. however, there was high variability in bronchoscopy use between the participating intensive care units.

TI  == the relative roles of bacteria and host inflammatory cells in siga degradation.
AB  == objective: secretory immunoglobulin (ig) a, the most important ig for lung defense, is highly dependent on its molecular structure for its immune activity.  proteolytic cleavage of siga may occur in the airways and render the siga molecule inactive. previous studies have attributed iga cleavage to neutrophils (polymorphonucleur cells [pmns]) and other host immunoinflammatory cells in the airways or bacterial pathogens. the resultant iga degradation leads to airway inflammation and subsequent pneumonia. the aim of this study was to discern the relative roles of host inflammatory cells and bacteria in siga cleavage in vitro. methods: siga was cocultured with pmns, pmns activated with fmlp, monocytes, monocytes pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (lps), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas, or acinetobacter alone or with monocyte culture supernatants and pmns. siga cleavage resulted in two fractions,  a <75 kda fraction (secretory component fraction) and an intact siga fraction by  size exclusion ultrafiltration. this was quantified by elisa and confirmed by sds-page. results: neither naive nor activated pmns showed any cleavage of siga.  unstimulated monocytes or lps stimulated monocytes also failed to demonstrate fragmentation of siga. only modest siga cleavage was noted when both pmns and monocytes were stimulated before coculture with siga but marked siga proteolysis  was noted with the addition of pseudomonas or acinetobacter but not mrsa. conclusions: bacterial pathogens, but not activated immunoinflammatory cells, were responsible for siga degradation in this study. this was evident only with pseudomonas and acinetobacter. this may be a virulence factor for pneumonia with  these pathogens in vivo.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus does not impact sensitivity to  human beta defensin 4.
AB  == antibiotic usage is essential for infection control but hastens emergence of antibiotic resistant microbes. in particular, acinetobacter baumannii is an important pathogen because of its heightened ability to acquire drug resistance.  the need for novel antibacterial agents led us to evaluate the sensitivity of drug-resistant bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of human beta defensin 4 (hbd-4). clinical isolates of a. baumannii (n=14), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=15), and staphylococcus aureus (n=20), including 10 methicillin-resistant (mrsa) isolates, were examined. all bacterial strains were susceptible to hbd-4 antimicrobial activity, with no correlation between antibiotic resistance and hbd-4 sensitivity. the results demonstrate that antibiotic resistant microorganisms, including mrsa, can be inhibited by hbd-4, which may represent an effective therapeutic agent for infections involving drug-resistant microorganisms.

AB  == the essential oil of silver fir (abies alba) is known to help respiratory system  and have easing and soothing effect for muscle. in the present study, we investigated the chemical composition, cytotoxicity and its biological activities of silver fir (abies alba) essential oil. the composition of the oil was analyzed by gc-ms and bornyl acetate (30.31%), camphene (19.81%), 3-carene (13.85%), tricyclene (12.90%), dl-limonene (7.50%), alpha-pinene (2.87%), caryophyllene (2.18%), beta-phellandrene (2.13%), borneol (1.74%), bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene,2,3-dimethyl (1.64%) and alpha-terpinene (1.24%) were the major components in the oil. the results tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay indicated that the oil showed no cytotoxic effect, at concentrations of 1 and 5%, for as long as 24 and 3 h, respectively. the antiradical capacity was evaluated by measuring the scavenging activity of the essential oil on the 2,20-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (dpph) and 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (abts) radicals. the oil was able to reduce the both radicals dose-dependently, and the concentration required for 50% reduction  (rc(50)) against dpph radicals (2.7 +/- 0.63%) was lower than abts radicals (8.5  +/- 0.27%). the antibacterial activity of the oil was also evaluated using disc diffusion method against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, listeria monocytogenes, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and vibrio parahaemolyticcus. the oil exhibited no antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains tested except s. aureus of mild activity.

TI  == silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coatings: antibacterial activity and surface analysis.
AB  == the colonisation of clinical and industrial surfaces with pathogenic microorganisms has prompted increased research into the development of effective  antibacterial and antifouling coatings. there is evidence that implanted biomedical surfaces coated with metallic silver can be inactivated by physiological fluids, thus reducing the bioactivity of the coating. in this work, we report the biofilm inhibition of staphylococcus epidermidis using a room temperature processed silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coating. the release of silver ions from these fluoropolymers over a six-day period inhibited  bacterial encrustation - as observed by scanning electron microscopy (sem). x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) analysis indicated differences in carbon, fluorine and sodium surface composition between silver doped and undoped fluoropolymers after exposure to nutrient rich media. these silver doped perfluoropolyether coatings also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii; suggesting potential use in preventing transmission of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of these silver release coatings may be exploited on biomaterials surfaces to combat the development of resistant gram-negative enterobacteriaceae that can occur during prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections.

TI  == a simple and large-scale strategy for the preparation of ag nanoparticles supported on resin-derived carbon and their antibacterial properties.
AB  == a simple strategy was developed for preparing stable ag nanoparticles supported on carbon by carbonizing ag(+)/acrylic acid type ion-exchange resin complexes under n(2) atmosphere. the products were characterized by x-ray powder diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem) and uv-visible absorption spectroscopy. the results indicated that the ag nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surface of carbon, and their size could be regulated by tuning the carbonization temperature. the antibacterial assay showed that the ag/c composites possess good antibacterial properties that are determined largely by the ag particle size. furthermore, the  composites are very stable and they do not show obviously change even after storing at ambient conditions for more than one year.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the test study in europe (2004-2007).
AB  == tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. this report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 european countries between 2004 and 2007. tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the a. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (8.5% of e. coli) and esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of k. pneumoniae). only amikacin was  active against >90% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against gram-positive agents across europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected s. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the e. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the s. pneumoniae strains). longitudinal analysis showed no increase in  tigecycline mic values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance  was noted for several comparator agents.

TI  == [retrospective evaluation of 15 cases with psoas abscesses].
AB  == psoas abscesses are suppurative collections within the fascia surrounding the psoas and iliacus muscles. in this retrospective study it was aimed to evaluate the demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings and treatment outcomes of 15 psoas abscess cases admitted to baskent university hospital, ankara, turkey during june 2003-january 2008 period. the mean age of the patients was 55.8 years (range 18 to 70 years) with a female to male ratio of 5/10. thirteen of the cases (86.5%) were admitted with the complaints of fever and back pain. thirteen of the cases were diagnosed by abdominal computerized tomography while the other two by abdominal ultrasonography. one of the 15 patients was considered as primary psoas abscess, while the remaining 14 as secondary psoas abscess. the most common accompanying disease was diabetes mellitus (66.6%). fourteen patients with secondary psoas abscess had vertebral osteomyelitis which  was due to tuberculosis in five cases, to urinary tract infection in five cases,  to pneumoniae in two cases, to surgical infection in one case and to brucellosis  in one case. the cultivation of the abscess material from the 14 secondary psoas  abscess cases revealed growth of bacteria in 11 of them (5 mycobacterium tuberculosis, 1 escherichia coli, 1 methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus,  1 methicilin-resistant s. aureus, 1 acinetobacter baumannii, 1 brucella melitensis, 1 serratia marcescens). the biochemical parameters of the cases (mean leukocyte counts: 14.500 cell/mm3; mean erythrocyte sedimentation rates: 78 mm/hour; mean c-reactive protein levels: 108 mg/dl) were also high. thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage and received appropriate antibiotic treatment and the other two patients were treated with open surgical debridement. the duration of antimicrobial treatment was one year for m. tuberculosis cases and about 4-6 weeks in the others. one of the cases died due to complicating meningitis and sepsis. it is remarkable that in our series none of the psoas abscess cases were secondary to the diseases of the digestive tract unlike the series indicated in the literature. the isolation of m. tuberculosis as the causative agent in 5 (33.3%) cases emphasizes the fact that tuberculosis is still an important public health problem in turkey.

TI  == regulation of acinetobacter baumannii biofilm formation.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative opportunistic nosocomial pathogen. this microorganism survives in hospital environments despite unfavorable conditions such as desiccation, nutrient starvation and antimicrobial treatments. it is hypothesized that its ability to persist in these environments, as well as  its virulence, is a result of its capacity to form biofilms. a. baumannii forms biofilms on abiotic surfaces such as polystyrene and glass as well as biotic surfaces such as epithelial cells and fungal filaments. pili assembly and production of the bap surface-adhesion protein play a role in biofilm initiation  and maturation after initial attachment to abiotic surfaces. furthermore, the adhesion and biofilm phenotypes of some clinical isolates seem to be related to the presence of broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. the regulation of the formation and development of these biofilms is as diverse as the surfaces on which this bacterium persists and as the cellular components that participate in  this programmed multistep process. the regulatory processes associated with biofilm formation include sensing of bacterial cell density, the presence of different nutrients and the concentration of free cations available to bacterial  cells. some of these extracellular signals may be sensed by two-component regulatory systems such as bfmrs. this transcriptional regulatory system activates the expression of the usher-chaperone assembly system responsible for the production of pili, needed for cell attachment and biofilm formation on polystyrene surfaces. however, such a system is not required for biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces when cells are cultured in chemically defined media. interestingly, the bfmrs system also controls cell morphology under particular culture conditions.

TI  == [clinical experience with tigecycline in the treatment of nosocomial infections caused by isolates exhibiting prevalent resistance mechanisms].
AB  == this article reviews the clinical experience with tigecycline in the treatment of infections caused by microorganisms with prevalent resistance mechanisms among nosocomial microbiota, as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multidrug- resistant acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. most of articles  found in the literature describe the use of tigecycline in the treatment of severe infections (sepsis and septic shock, nosocomial pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia...) produced by multidrug-resistant microorganisms, in patients with multiple comorbidities (admitted in icu, with malignancies, transplants and/or immunodepressed...) and in many occasions after  failures of previous antibiotic treatments. favourable outcomes with tigecycline  are reported in most articles. however, an accurate global assessment is difficult since, in addition to the described confounding factors, there are concomitant or sequential antibiotic treatments in several communications, and lack of relevant clinical (as comorbidities), microbiological (as susceptibility) and outcome (different criteria by different authors) data in others. more even,  the described series are retrospective and lack of control groups. nevertheless the usefulness of this revision is based on the fact that in daily clinical practice the use of tigecycline will increase, since epidemiology of specific hospital medical units shows multidrug resistance among nosocomial isolates and tigecycline can be one of the scarce available compounds active against multidrug-resistant strains/clones.

AB  == objective: to assess the effect of enhanced infection control measures with screening for gastrointestinal colonization on limiting the spread of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae in a new york city hospital endemic for this pathogen. design: retrospective observational study with pre- and postinterventional phases. methods: beginning in 2006, a comprehensive infection  control program was instituted in a 10-bed medical and surgical intensive care unit at a university-based medical center. in addition to being placed in contact isolation, all patients colonized or infected with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were cohorted to one end of the unit. improved decontamination of hands and environmental surfaces was encouraged. in addition, routine rectal surveillance cultures were screened for the presence of  carbapenem-resistant pathogens. the number of patients per quarter with clinical  cultures positive for carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae was compared during the  approximately 2-year periods before and after the intervention. results: the mean number (+/-sd) of new patients per 1,000 patient-days per quarter with cultures yielding carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae decreased from 9.7 +/- 2.2 before the intervention to 3.7 +/- 1.6 after the intervention (p < .001). there was no change in the mean number of patient-days or the mean number of patients per quarter with cultures yielding methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, or carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa after the intervention. there was no association between antibiotic usage patterns and carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae. conclusions: the comprehensive intervention that combined intensified infection control measures with routine rectal surveillance cultures was helpful  in reducing the incidence of carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae in an intensive care unit where strains producing the carbapenemase kpc were endemic.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == the effects of the bacterial interaction with visible-light responsive titania photocatalyst on the bactericidal performance.
AB  == bactericidal activity of traditional titanium dioxide (tio2) photocatalyst is effective only upon irradiation by ultraviolet light, which restricts the potential applications of tio2 for use in our living environments. recently carbon-containing tio2 was found to be photoactive at visible-light illumination  that affords the potential to overcome this problem; although, the bactericidal activity of these photocatalysts is relatively lower than conventional disinfectants. evidenced from scanning electron microscopy and confocal raman spectral mapping analysis, we found the interaction with bacteria was significantly enhanced in these anatase/rutile mixed-phase carbon-containing tio2. bacteria-killing experiments indicate that a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri and acinetobacter baumannii, were eliminated by the new nanoparticle with higher bacterial interaction property. these findings suggest the created materials with high bacterial interaction ability might be a useful strategy to improve the antimicrobial activity of visible-light-activated tio2.

TI  == decontamination of laundry at low temperature with cuwb50, a novel copper-based biocidal compound.
AB  == background: traditional laundry decontamination relies on thermal disinfection that degrades textiles. we investigated the ability of a novel copper-based biocidal compound, cuwb50, to assist in the decontamination of swatches purposely contaminated with staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter during "real-life" low-temperature machine washing with and without 2 commercial detergents. methods: contaminated and noncontaminated swatches were attached to ballast sheets and washed in cold water for 15 minutes in an industrial electrolux machine. we assessed colony-forming units (cfu) on the swatches and in the postwash water. results: low-temperature machine washing produced only partial reductions in viable methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii counts on swatches and resulted in cross contamination of other swatches in the same wash. washing with cuwb50 alone at high concentration (100 mg/l), however, resulted in superior decontamination compared with water alone, whereas washing with a combination of detergent and cuwb50 at low concentration (5 mg/l) yielded synergistic and complete decontamination of swatches and postwash water. conclusion: our results show highly effective laundry decontamination using cuwb50 with detergent at low temperature and are timely both in terms of rising energy costs and textile degradation issues.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of cationic polyethylenimines on dry surfaces.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cationic n-dodecyl-n-methylpolyethylenimine (pei+)  against s. aureus, a. baumannii, and e. coli was evaluated when the polymer was applied as a coating to various surfaces using a paint-like procedure. antimicrobial activity of pei+ as a function of time was determined using an assay for long-term survival involving placement of single drops of various bacterial concentrations on dry surfaces. these data were compared with an assay  method where bacteria were applied by spraying and surfaces were incubated overnight under agar. pei+-coated surfaces were found to be highly bactericidal after 30 min when bacteria were sprayed onto surfaces. however, when bacteria were applied as single drops, pei+-coated surfaces were less biocidal at short contact times particularly for a. baumannii and e. coli. the observations are explained in the context of the difference in drying time between drops deposited on uncoated surfaces and pei+-coated surfaces and the sensitivity of bacterial survival to dehydration. these results demonstrate that pei+-coated surfaces are  not effectively biocidal for some types of bacteria under certain conditions and  that the method of assaying bactericidal efficiency can greatly affect the results obtained.

TI  == gallium maltolate treatment eradicates pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in thermally injured mice.
AB  == gallium (ga) is a semimetallic element that has demonstrated therapeutic and diagnostic-imaging potential in a number of disease settings, including cancer and infectious diseases. gallium's biological actions stem from its ionic radius  being almost the same as that of ferric iron (fe(3+)), whereby it can replace iron (fe) in fe(3+)-dependent biological systems, such as bacterial and mammalian fe transporters and fe(3+)-containing enzymes. unlike fe(3+), ionic gallium (ga(3+)) cannot be reduced, and when incorporated, it inactivates fe(3+)-dependent reduction and oxidation processes that are necessary for bacterial and mammalian cell proliferation. most pathogenic bacteria require fe for growth and function, and the availability of fe in the host or environment can greatly enhance virulence. we examined whether gallium maltolate (gam), a novel formulation of ga, had antibacterial activity in a thermally injured acute  infection mouse model. dose-response studies indicated that a gam dose as low as  25 mg/kg of body weight delivered subcutaneously was sufficient to provide 100% survival in a lethal p. aeruginosa-infected thermally injured mouse model. mice treated with 100 mg/kg gam had undetectable levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa in their wounds, livers, and spleens, while the wounds of untreated mice were colonized with over 10(8) p. aeruginosa cfu/g of tissue and their livers and spleens were colonized with over 10(5) p. aeruginosa cfu/g of tissue. gam also significantly reduced the colonization of staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii in the wounds of thermally injured mice. furthermore, gam was also therapeutically effective in preventing preestablished p. aeruginosa infections at the site of the injury from spreading systemically. taken together, our data suggest that gam is potentially a novel antibacterial agent for the prevention and treatment of wound infections following thermal injury.

TI  == [investigation of the effect of efflux pump inhibitors to mic values of ciprofloxacin in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus].
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of efflux pump inhibitors on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of ciprofloxacin (cip) in fluoroquinolone-resistant 42 pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 42), escherichia coil (n= 97), acinetobacter baumannii (n= 58) and staphylococcus aureus (n= 80) strains isolated from clinical specimens. for this purpose phenylalanyl-arginyl-beta-naphthylamide (pa beta n) was used for p. aeruginosa, e. coli, a. baumannii and reserpine for s. aureus isolates as pump inhibitors. fluoroquinolone resistance of the clinical isolates were determined by vitek2 compact (biomerieux, france) automated system and confirmed with standard broth microdilution method. for the investigation of the effects of inhibitor agents, the mic values were also determined in the presence of 25 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml pa beta n and 20 microg/ml reserpine. in the presence of 25 mg/l pa beta n, 61.9% of cip resistant p. aeruginosa strains converted to susceptible ones, while this rate was 73.8% in the presence of 100 mg/l pa beta n. in a. baumannii clinical isolates, 8.6% and 15.5% of cip-resistant strains have become  susceptible in the presence of 25 mg/l and 100 mg/l pa beta n, respectively. similarly the mic values for cip have decreased > or = 4 folds in 42.2%, and > or = 2 folds in 30.9% of e. coli isolates, in the presence of 25 mg/l pa beta n, however, there was no change in mics of 26.9% of e. coli strains. the mic values  have also been lowered for > or = 4 folds in 83.6%, and two folds in 13.4% of e.  coli strains by the use of 100 mg/l pa beta n concentration, however, no decrease in mic values was detected in 3% of the isolates. 20 mg/l of reserpine have caused a decrease of > or = 4 folds in 8.75%, and two folds in 33.75% of s. aureus isolates, while there was no change in mic values of 57.5% of s. aureus strains. our results showed that pa beta n causes significant reduction in mic values for cip in the clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, e. coli and a. baumannii and this effect may be attributed to efflux pump inhibition. in contrast, it was concluded that reserpine does not have a considerable effect on  the mic values of s. aureus against ciprofloxacin.

TI  == microbiologic study of the pathogens isolated from wound culture among wenchuan earthquake survivors.
AB  == on may 12, an unprecedented earthquake struck wenchuan county, sichuan, china, and 1823 victims were admitted to west china hospital, sichuan, china. a total of 464 nonduplicate clinical isolates from wounds of earthquake victims were analyzed. the results show that the most common pathogen was staphylococcus aureus, but only 24.4% of the total isolates were gram-positive bacteria, and 73.2% were gram-negative bacteria. the isolates were significantly different from isolation pattern of 2004 tsunami in thailand. the isolation rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer and pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii in this study might increase the risk of nosocomial infection. in this  situation, clinical microbiologists, infection control staff, and administration  decision makers should pay high attention to prevent disaster-associated nosocomial infections.

TI  == therapeutic index of gramicidin s is strongly modulated by d-phenylalanine analogues at the beta-turn.
AB  == analogues of the cationic antimicrobial peptide gramicidin s (gs), cyclo(val-orn-leu-d-phe-pro)2, with d-phe residues replaced by different (restricted mobility, mostly) surrogates have been synthesized and used in sar studies against several pathogenic bacteria. while all d-phe substitutions are shown by nmr to preserve the overall beta-sheet conformation, they entail subtle  structural alterations that lead to significant modifications in biological activity. in particular, the analogue incorporating d-tic (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid) shows a modest but significant increase in therapeutic index, mostly due to a sharp decrease in hemolytic effect. the fact that nmr data show a shortened distance between the d-tic aromatic ring and the orn delta-amino group may help explain the improved antibiotic profile of this analogue.

TI  == [bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. the objective of this study was to explore application of the combined  detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. methods: totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. the age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by  streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. the aspirate samples were also amplified for dna of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (tem-pcr) and detected with luminex xmap technology platform. results: the total positive rate  by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were hemophilus  influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella  pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187)  were acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. the total positive rate by combined detection of culture and tem-pcr assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. conclusion: the tem-pcr assay may increase the detection rate of hemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. the tem-pcr needs further improvement for diagnosis of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in europe and its potential impact on empirical therapy.
AB  == the problem of microbial drug resistance is a major public health concern, due to its global dimension and alarming magnitude, although the epidemiology of resistance can exhibit remarkable geographical variability and rapid temporal evolution. the major resistance issues overall are those related to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. europe is not free from any of these issues, although their impact may be significantly different in different countries. mrsa rates are high in several european countries, but seem to have levelled off in some settings. diffusion of  vre is still irregular. the most alarming resistance trends are those observed for enterobacteriaceae and the gram-negative non-fermenters, with a generalized increase in rates of resistance to the most important anti-gram-negative agents (beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones) and the circulation of strains showing multidrug resistance phenotypes.

TI  == summer peaks in the incidences of gram-negative bacterial infection among hospitalized patients.
AB  == objective: recognition of seasonal trends in hospital infections may improve diagnosis, use of empirical therapy, and infection prevention interventions. there are very few data available regarding the seasonal variability of these infections. we quantified the seasonal variation in the incidences of hospital infection caused by common bacterial pathogens and estimated the association between temperature changes and infection rates. methods: a cohort of all adult patients admitted to the university of maryland medical center during the period  from 1998 through 2005 was analyzed. time-series analyses were used to estimate the association of the number of infections per month caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci with season and temperature, while controlling for long-term trends. results: there were 218,594 admissions to the index hospital, and analysis of 26,624 unique clinical cultures that grew the organisms of interest identified increases in the mean monthly rates of infection caused by p. aeruginosa (28% of isolates recovered; p ! .01), e. cloacae (46%; p  ! .01), e. coli (12%; p ! .01), and a. baumannii (21%; pp.06). for each 10 degrees f increase, we observed a 17% increase in the monthly rates of infection  caused by p. aeruginosa (pp.01) and a. baumanii (pp.05). conclusion: significantly higher rates of gram-negative infection were observed during the summer months, compared with other seasons. for some pathogens, higher temperatures were associated with higher infection rates, independent of seasonality. these findings have important implications for infection prevention, such as enhanced surveillance during the warmer months, and for choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized adults. future, quasi-experimental investigations of gram-negative infection prevention initiatives should control for seasonal variation.

TI  == [nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  == we conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout japan according to the special survey plan  to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral cpfx. results of the first special survey  (2001) were already reported in this journal. the current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout japan to determine susceptibility to cpfx and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between january and june 2005. the results of cpfx in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. the minimum inhibitory concentration of cpfx at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (mic90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/ml for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. however, the cpfx-susceptibility rate of escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. for morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic90 of cpfx tended to increase with time. the cpfx-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for p. aeruginosa and 67.9% for stenotrophomonas maltophilia. with the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of  respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for cpfx, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. these susceptibility rates for cpfx were similar to the rates for cefozopran and  imipenem. these values generally indicated favorable cpfx susceptibility testing  results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of cpfx particularly against gram-negative bacteria. further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of e. coli, m. morganii, and p. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.

TI  == tackling antibiotic resistance: a dose of common antisense?
AB  == resistance to antimicrobial agents undermines our ability to treat bacterial infections. it attracts intense media and political interest and impacts on personal health and costs to health infrastructures. bacteria have developed resistance to all licensed antibacterial agents, and their ability to become resistant to unlicensed agents is often demonstrated during the development process. conventional approaches to antimicrobial development, involving modification of existing agents or production of synthetic derivatives, are unlikely to deliver the range or type of drugs that will be needed to meet all future requirements. although many companies are seeking novel targets, further radical approaches to both antimicrobial design and the reversal of resistance are now urgently required. in this article, we discuss 'antisense' (or 'antigene') strategies to inhibit resistance mechanisms at the genetic level. these offer an innovative approach to a global problem and could be used to restore the efficacy of clinically proven agents. moreover, this strategy has the potential to overcome critical resistances, not only in the so-called 'superbugs' (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci  and multidrug-resistant strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), but in resistant strains of any bacterial species.

TI  == a study on nosocomial pathogens in icu with special reference to multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic resistance has reached crisis point in many hospitals around the world. the majority are swamped with meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and many with multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negatives. whilst there are  good treatment alternatives available for serious infections due to mrsa, mortality rates remain high. for mdr gram-negatives the situation is more complex and worrying. there are few, if any, new agents in development that can be expected to benefit the situation in the next decade. moreover, extreme (or extensive) drug-resistant and even pandrug-resistant gram-negative infections are increasingly being described. although definitions are confused in this area, reports suggest that patients in some intensive care units are dying from lack of availability of any antibiotic active against certain strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. a better understanding of the molecular basis of resistance is urgently needed if it is to be successfully overcome. moreover, we urgently need better global early warning systems to detect new resistances and put mechanisms in place for their control.

TI  == anti-adherence activity and antimicrobial durability of anti-infective-coated catheters against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the anti-adherence and antimicrobial durability of anti-infective catheters against multidrug-resistant (mdr) staphylococcus aureus  (resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin and methicillin) and mdr gram-negative bacteria (stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus and enterobacter agglomerans) that are often associated with catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsis). methods: catheters impregnated with minocycline  and rifampicin (m/r) or with silver-platinum and carbon (spc) or with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (chx/ss) were compared with non-coated catheters. adherence of organisms was tested by using an established biofilm colonization model. all isolates were rifampicin-resistant. antimicrobial durability was tested by soaking 1 cm segments of the catheter in serum and determining zones of inhibition against the tested organisms at weekly intervals. results: the m/r catheters showed significantly superior anti-adherence activity  and more prolonged antimicrobial durability when compared with chx/ss-central venous catheter (cvc), spc-cvc and uncoated control catheters against mdr and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (mdr vrsa) (all p values < or = 0.02), mdr s. maltophilia (all p values < 0.005) and mdr a. baumannii/calcoaceticus (all p values < 0.002), respectively. m/r-cvc and chx/ss-cvc had comparable anti-adherence and antimicrobial durability against mdr e. agglomerans, and these two were superior to spc-cvc and the uncoated control catheters (all p values < 0.001). conclusions: m/r-cvc demonstrated superior anti-adherence activity and more prolonged antimicrobial durability when compared with other approved anti-infective catheters against mdr vrsa and/or mdr gram-negative bacteria that  are often associated with crbsis. this finding could explain their efficacy and better performance in clinical studies.

TI  == prediction models to identify hospitalized patients at risk of being colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii calcoaceticus complex.
AB  == background: the multidrug-resistant (mdr) acinetobacter baumannii calcoaceticus complex (abc) has emerged as an important cause of nosocomial infections. the aims of the study were to evaluate risk factors for mdr-abc in intensive care units (icus) as well as in medical and surgical wards, to define the likelihood ratios (lrs) of risk factors and to determine if risk factors differ depending on whether colonization or infections are considered. methods: two prospective matched case-control studies were performed. mdr-abc was defined as a strain resistant to four or more classes of antibiotics. the two case groups included patients with mdr-abc infections or colonization. controls were selected among patients not harbouring abc. matching criteria were the number of days from admission to mdr-abc isolation among cases and the duration of hospitalization among controls. results: overall, 514 patients were included in the study. one hundred and thirty-seven patients were infected and 120 colonized. a charlson score >3 and previous methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolation and beta-lactam use were independent risk factors for colonization and infection. bedridden status and previous icu admission were associated with colonization, while the presence of a central venous catheter and surgery were related to infection. the analysis of lrs showed an association between the presence of more than two risk factors and colonization or infection. the highest predicting value was observed for the presence of more than two risk factors and colonization in patients with no history of icu admission. conclusions: this study provides novel information that can be used to identify interventions for different stages of the spread of mdr-abc.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and etest.
AB  == the current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical u.s. isolates of target pathogens. findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (bmd) surveillance (d. c. draghi et al., poster d-0701, 46th intersci. conf. antimicrob. agents chemother., san francisco, ca). differences were noted among acinetobacter spp. and serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus pyogenes. to address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by bmd and etest. in all, 1,800 staphylococcus aureus, 259 s. pyogenes, 226 streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 enterobacteriaceae, and 227 acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. tigecycline had potent activity by bmd, with >99.6% susceptibility (%s) observed for all pathogens with  interpretive criteria, excluding enterobacter cloacae (98.3% s) and e. faecalis (86.0% s), and mic(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (s. pyogenes/s. pneumoniae) to 1  mug/ml (enterobacteriaceae/a. baumannii). similar profiles were observed by etest, with the exception of a. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens  etest mics trended one doubling-dilution higher than bmd mics. major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding a. baumannii, s. marcescens, and s. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in mics were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline etest for testing s. marcescens, acinetobacter spp., and s. pneumoniae is warranted.

TI  == [etiology, epidemiology and microbiological diagnosis of intra-abdominal infections].
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iais) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  the etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable  and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired iais enterobacteria predominate (mostly escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly bacteroides fragilis). in nosocomial iais, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. e candida spp. diagnostic microbiology of iais is complex and plays a relevant role especially in some situations (e. g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing iais. resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.

TI  == acinetobacter baumannii: an emerging multidrug-resistant threat.
AB  == amid the recent attention focused on the growing impact of methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa infections,  the pathogen acinetobacter baumannii has been stealthily gaining ground as an agent of serious nosocomial and community-acquired infection. historically, acinetobacter spp. have been associated with opportunistic infections that were rare and of modest severity; the last two decades have seen an increase in both the incidence and seriousness of a. baumannii infection, with the main targets being patients in intensive-care units. although this organism appears to have a  predilection for the most vulnerable patients, community-acquired a. baumannii infection is an increasing cause for concern. the increase in a. baumannii infections has paralleled the alarming development of resistance it has demonstrated. the persistence of this organism in healthcare facilities, its inherent hardiness and its resistance to antibiotics results in it being a formidable emerging pathogen. this review aims to put into perspective the threat posed by this organism in hospital and community settings, describes new information that is changing our view of acinetobacter virulence and resistance,  and calls for greater understanding of how this multifaceted organism came to be  a major pathogen.

TI  == beta-lactams against emerging 'superbugs': progress and pitfalls.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is an ever-growing problem. so-called 'superbugs', such as multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring multiple resistance determinants, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, carbapenemases, efflux pumps and downregulated outer-membrane proteins or porins, are becoming more prevalent in hospital, intensive and long-term care settings. enterobacteriaceae are also acquiring a myriad of beta-lactamases, such as class a and d carbapenemases, and plasmid-borne class c cephalosporinases. gram-positive superbugs, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-intermediate or heteroglycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), are problematic pathogens,  both in the hospital and in the community (e.g., community-acquired mrsa and prsp). beta-lactam antibiotics remain among the most effective and safest anti-infectives in use, although their utility is being severely challenged by these superbugs. this review will discuss aspects of resistance seen in these pathogens and will review some of the newer beta-lactam agents, both investigational and in clinical use, that target these superbugs.

TI  == bacterial resistance surveillance in china: a report from mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in china. a total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15  cities throughout china. antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by clinical and  laboratory standards institute. the results of the mics revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of  staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of staphylococcus epidermidis strains. penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. five strains of enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. all staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. a high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the gram-positive cocci. enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation  cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. about 65% of the escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less  than 10%. imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant  isolates. combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. amikacin was active against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. in conclusion,  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive s. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in china. no glycopeptides-resistant staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci was seldom.

TI  == control of bacterial biofilms with marine alkaloid derivatives.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are defined as a community of surface-attached bacteria that are protected by an extracellular matrix of biomolecules. we have recently reported the synthesis of a small molecule, denoted tage, based on the natural product bromoageliferin and demonstrated that tage has anti-biofilm activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. herein we demonstrate that tage: (1) does not have selective toxicity against cells within the biofilm state, (2) will inhibit  biofilm development under flow conditions, indicating that the cv staining protocol correlates with the ability to be active under biomimetic conditions, and (3) will disperse preformed p. aeruginosa biofilms. we also present preliminary toxicity work that indicates that tage is devoid of cytotoxicity in rat and mice cell lines. advanced derivatives of tage have generated compounds shown to be exceedingly effective as biofilm inhibitors against the gamma-proteobacteria in this study (p. aeruginosa strains pao1, pa14, pdo300, and acinetobacter baumannii). tage derivatives also possessed anti-biofilm activity against the beta-proteobacterium bordetella bronchiseptica (rb50) and the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus;tage derivatives inhibited the formation of biofilms, however, some of this activity is attributed to microbicidal activity. the tage derivatives presented in this study, however, do  not disperse pre-formed biofilms with the same efficiency as tage.

TI  == healthcare-associated infections in neonates.
AB  == purpose of review: to identify important findings in the recent literature related to healthcare-associated infections in neonatal care. recent findings: bloodstream infection remains the leading healthcare-associated infection in the  neonatal unit, but multimodal interventions have been shown to successfully reduce this life-threatening complication. emerging pathogens such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative organisms and pan-resistant acinetobacter baumannii or serratia marcescens complicate the use of standard antibiotic treatment and are a particular concern in this setting because of the limitation in antibiotic classes among neonates. community-acquired methicillin-resistant s. aureus infections are increasing in frequency and are particularly worrisome. fluconazole prophylaxis offers a simple solution for the prevention of invasive candida infection and has been already widely adopted. although there is evidence for its efficacy, there is still some  debate about the pros and cons of azole prophylaxis in the prevention of invasive candida infections. furthermore, its use in low-prevalence settings remains highly questionable. the introduction of restrictive guidelines limiting the use  of antibiotics in early-onset neonatal infections has proved to be safe and efficient and may also reduce the incidence of late-onset infection. outbreaks remain an ongoing concern in neonatal care and are increasingly complicated by emerging multiresistant pathogens. summary: healthcare-associated infections remain a permanent challenge among neonates.

TI  == emerging gram-negative antibiotic resistance: daunting challenges, declining sensitivities, and dire consequences.
AB  == emerging antibiotic resistance has created a major public health dilemma, compounded by a dearth of new antibiotic options. multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms have received less attention than gram-positive threats,  such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, but are just as menacing. pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii employ a variety of resistance mechanisms and are associated with dangerous nosocomial outbreaks. in some cases these pathogens have expressed resistance to all clinically available compounds. the emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in the community has raised alarm. furthermore, the carbapenems, currently the most successful class of antibiotics, are showing signs of vulnerability. while the search for new antibiotic options continues, there is urgent need to employ strategies that will slow the development of resistance to the current armamentarium, such as avoiding prolonged antibiotic use or under-dosing, using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles to choose dosing regimens, and encouraging early and aggressive empirical therapy, followed by de-escalation and narrowing the antimicrobial spectrum when culture results become available.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  == a horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (rcws) in taiwan. some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas  aeruginosa (mdr-pa) and acinetobacter baumannii (mdr-ab), were identified. pulsotypes of esbl-producing p. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the prevalences of mrsa, esbl-producing e. coli (k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) p. aeruginosa, mdr-pa, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii and mdr-ab were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0%  and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. among the 44 respiratory isolates of  p. mirabilis with an esbl phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were mycobacterium tuberculosis. among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). high prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in rcws.

TI  == multidrug-resistant organisms in military wounds from iraq and afghanistan.
AB  == mortality from battlefield wounds has historically declined, thanks to better surgical management, faster transport of casualties, and improved antibiotics. today, one of the major challenges facing u.s. military caregivers is the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms in orthopaedic extremity wounds. the most frequently identified resistant strains of bacteria are staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics may be an  important factor in building resistant strains. acinetobacter infections appear to hospital-acquired and not from an initial colonization of the injury. more research is required to give military physicians the tools they require to reduce the infection rate and defeat multidrug-resistant organisms.

TI  == outcomes of bacteremia in burn patients involved in combat operations overseas.
AB  == background: burn patients constitute approximately 5% of casualties injured in support of us military operations in iraq (operation iraqi freedom [oif]) and afghanistan (operation enduring freedom [oef]). since the onset of these conflicts, there have been numerous casualties infected with multidrug-resistant  bacteria. it is currently unclear if bacteremia with these multidrug-resistant organisms in oif/oef burn casualties is associated with increased mortality. study design: we performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted  to the us army institute of surgical research burn center from january 2003 to may 2006 to evaluate bacteremia in our burn-patient population. results: one hundred twenty-nine of 1,258 patients admitted to the burn center became bacteremic during their hospitalization. of these, 92 had bacteremia with the top four pathogens in our burn center, ie, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, and staphylococcus aureus. presence of any bacteremia was associated with mortality and increased ventilator days. bacteremia with k pneumoniae was associated with a statistically increased mortality and a prolonged ventilator course relative to all other pathogens. conclusions: casualties of oif/oef with burn injuries did not have different outcomes than patients whose burns were not associated with military operations. bacteremia, especially with a multidrug-resistant organism, causes increased mortality in burn patients. of all the pathogens causing bacteremia, k  pneumonia appears to have the greatest impact on mortality.

TI  == melatonin as an antibiotic: new insights into the actions of this ubiquitous molecule.
AB  == the incidence of serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria has been increasing rapidly worldwide despite advances in antibacterial therapy in the last two decades. among multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii are of great importance, because they have emerged as primary nosocomial pathogens in hospital outbreaks. in this study, we investigated whether melatonin has antibacterial effects against these microorganisms in vitro. the minimum inhibitory concentration of melatonin was determined using a standard microdilution method at 24 and 48 hr. melatonin inhibited microbial growth at both 24 and 48 hr; but results showed that melatonin had antibacterial effects against these microorganisms after 48 hr of incubation in lower doses [concentrations between 31.25 to 125 microg/ml (0.13-0.53 mm)]. also, it was determined that melatonin has a more potent antimicrobial effect on gram-negative microorganism. among possible mechanisms, it is concluded that melatonin showed antibacterial effects by reducing intracellular substrates.

TI  == comparative analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from france, germany, italy, spain and the uk as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
AB  == as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test), bacterial isolates were collected from 39 centres in france, germany, italy, spain and the  uk between january 2004 and august 2006. antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined according to clsi guidelines. italy had the highest rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (36.4%), and was the only country to  report vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (8.6%). tigecycline was the only agent to which all gram-positive isolates were susceptible. for many of the  gram-negative organisms collected, antimicrobial susceptibilities were lowest among isolates from italy and highest among isolates from spain. the notable exception was acinetobacter baumannii, where the poorest susceptibility profile was among isolates from spain. for a. baumannii, mic(90)s of imipenem varied from 1 mg/l for isolates in france and germany to > or =32 mg/l for isolates from italy and spain. tigecycline was the only agent to maintain an mic(90) of < or =1 mg/l against isolates from all five countries. the in-vitro activity of tigecycline against both gram-positive and gram-negative isolates may make it valuable in the treatment of hospital infections, including those caused by otherwise antimicrobial-resistant organisms.

TI  == microbiological surveillance of the surgical intensive care unit in zagreb--a pivot for guideline-based therapy of severe sepsis.
AB  == the aim of this retrospective study was to create guidelines for therapy of severe sepsis in surgical intensive care unit (icu) for unknown causative agent based on antimicrobial susceptibility of causative bacteria. seventy-four patients with severe sepsis from surgical icu in 2003.-2005. were included in study. their clinical and microbiological data were analyzed from the medical records. antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains isolated from the blood-culture was tested by disk diffusion method according to clsi (clinical laboratory standard institution). apache ii score was used to predict the severity of illness. statistical significance difference between results was tested by mann-whitney test and chi2 test. important problem remained type of sepsis: mono-agent sepsis presented less therapeutic problem than sepsis caused with two or more agents (mixed sepsis). methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were predominant causative agents in both type of sepsis. there was remarkable increase of a. baumannii prevalence in 2005 compared to 2004 and to 2003. there was also decrease of mrsa prevalence in 2004 and 2005 compared to 2003. p. aeruginosa were the predominant causative agents in 2004. mrsa displayed good susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolide, whereas p. aeruginosa showed excellent susceptibility to ceftazidime and carbapenems. a. baumannii, third predominant causative agent, exhibited excellent susceptibility to ampicillin+ sulbactam and carbapenems. the recommended therapy is empirical and should cover  all important pathogens.

TI  == evaluation of the inhibitory effects of human serum components on bactericidal activity of human beta defensin 3.
AB  == naturally occurring cationic antimicrobial peptides (caps) are an essential component of the innate immune system of multicellular organisms. at concentrations generally higher than those found in vivo, most caps exhibit strong antibacterial properties in vitro, but their activity may be inhibited by  body fluids, a fact that could limit their future use as antimicrobial and/or immunomodulatory agents. in the present study, we evaluated the effects of human  serum components on bactericidal activity of the human beta-defensin 3 (hbd-3), a cap considered particularly promising for future therapeutic employment. human serum diluted to 20% strongly inhibited the bactericidal activity of the peptide  against both the gram-positive species staphylococcus aureus and the gram-negative species acinetobacter baumannii. such activity was not restored in  serum devoid of salts (dialyzed), pre-treated with protease inhibitors, or subjected to both of these treatments. the addition of physiological concentrations of nacl, cacl2, and human albumin in the bactericidal assay abolished bactericidal activity of hbd-3 against s. aureus, while it only partially inhibited the activity of the peptide against a. baumannii. although a  proteolytic activity of serum on hbd-3 was demonstrated at the protein level by western blot, addition of physiological concentrations of trypsin to the bactericidal assay only partially affected the antibacterial properties of the peptide. altogether, these results demonstrate a major role of mono-divalent cations and serum proteins on inhibition of hbd-3 antibacterial properties and indicate a relative lack in sensitivity of the bactericidal activity of this peptide to trypsin and trypsin-like proteases.

TI  == identification and characterization of an acinetobacter baumannii biofilm-associated protein.
AB  == we have identified a homologue to the staphylococcal biofilm-associated protein (bap) in a bloodstream isolate of acinetobacter baumannii. the fully sequenced open reading frame is 25,863 bp and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular  mass of 854 kda. analysis of the nucleotide sequence reveals a repetitive structure consistent with bacterial cell surface adhesins. bap-specific monoclonal antibody (mab) 6e3 was generated to an epitope conserved among 41% of  a. baumannii strains isolated during a recent outbreak in the u.s. military health care system. flow cytometry confirms that the mab 6e3 epitope is surface exposed. random transposon mutagenesis was used to generate a. baumannii bap1302::ez-tn5, a mutant negative for surface reactivity to mab 6e3 in which the transposon disrupts the coding sequence of bap. time course confocal laser scanning microscopy and three-dimensional image analysis of actively growing biofilms demonstrates that this mutant is unable to sustain biofilm thickness and volume, suggesting a role for bap in supporting the development of the mature biofilm structure. this is the first identification of a specific cell surface protein directly involved in biofilm formation by a. baumannii and suggests that  bap is involved in intercellular adhesion within the mature biofilm.

AB  == a 5-year review of nosocomial infections, bacteraemia and wound colonization in patients admitted to a burn intensive care unit from june 2001 to may 2006 was carried out. all patients required intubation at some point, and icu support. data on bacterial and fungal isolates were entered prospectively into a hospital-wide computerized database. nosocomial infections (nis) were defined using standard cdc criteria. seventy-six patients were admitted during the study  period, with 57 qualifying for analysis. forty-two patients (74%) developed 137 nis, with 240 nis/100 admissions. the most common ni was pneumonia (43%), followed by burn wound infection (34%), primary bloodstream infection (20%) and urinary tract infection (3%). the device specific rate of pneumonia was 143 infections per 1000 ventilator days. there were 113 episodes of bacteraemia and 173 episodes of wound colonization without infection. the most common organisms causing nosocomial infections were acinetobacter sp. (n=33), followed by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n=24) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=22). a. baumannii isolates were highly multiresistant, with 82 distinct strains isolated from 47 patients (82% of patients). data from this and  other studies supports the hypothesis that a. baumannii is more common in tropical, warm climes necessitating vigorous infection control measures to optimise patient outcome.

TI  == comparative analysis of the bactericidal activities of amphibian peptide analogues against multidrug-resistant nosocomial bacterial strains.
AB  == due to the widespread resistance of bacteria to the available drugs, the discovery of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, and naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (amps) are considered promising candidates for future therapeutic use. amphibian skin is one of the richest sources of such amps. in the present study we compared the in vitro bactericidal activities of five amps from three different species of anurans against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates belonging to species often involved in nosocomial infections (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter baumannii). the peptides tested were temporins a, b, and g from rana temporaria; the fragment from positions 1 to 18 of esculentin 1b [esc(1-18)] from rana esculenta; and bombinin h2 from bombina variegata. when they were tested in buffer, all the peptides were bactericidal against all bacterial species tested (three strains of each species) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48 microm, with only a few exceptions. the temporins were found to be more active against gram-positive bacteria, especially when they were assayed in human serum; esc(1-18) showed fast and strong bactericidal activity, within 2 to 20 min, especially against the gram-negative species, which were killed by esc(1-18) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 microm; bombinin h2 displayed similar bactericidal activity toward all isolates.  interestingly, while the activities of the temporins and bombinin h2 were almost  completely inhibited in the presence of 20% human serum, the activity of esc(1-18) against the gram-negative species was partially preserved in the presence of 40% serum. this property renders this peptide an attractive molecule  for use in the development of new compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from the asia/pacific rim, europe and latin and north america collected as part of test and the in vitro activity of tigecycline.
AB  == objectives: to describe antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates associated with hospital infections collected from 266 centres in asia/pacific rim (n = 1,947), north america (n = 24,283), latin america (n = 1,957) and europe (n = 8,796). methods: isolates were collected from blood, respiratory tract, urine, skin, wound, body fluids and other defined sources between january 2004 and august 2006. only one isolate per patient was accepted. in vitro mics for the isolates were determined according to the clsi (formerly nccls) guidelines. results: key organisms collected were acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2,902), enterobacter spp. (n = 5,731), escherichia coli (n = 6,504), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4,916), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5,128), serratia marcescens (n = 2,313), enterococcus faecalis (n = 2,701), enterococcus faecium (n = 1,035)  and staphylococcus aureus (n = 5,753). rates of methicillin resistance among s. aureus and of vancomycin resistance among enterococci were highest in north america (2,016/3,809, 52.9% and 571/2,544, 22.4%, respectively) and lowest in europe (337/1,340, 25.1% and 36/916, 3.9%, respectively). tigecycline was the only antimicrobial to maintain activity against all gram-positive isolates (mic(90) values of <or=0.25 mg/l). overall, tigecycline and imipenem were the most active (>93% susceptibility in all regions) antimicrobials against the gram-negative species, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin were the most active against p. aeruginosa.  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among k. pneumoniae occurred most frequently in latin america (124/282, 44.0%). conclusions: tigecycline is a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is active against the common organisms associated with infections.

TI  == investigation of sources of potential bias in laboratory surveillance for anti-microbial resistance.
AB  == purpose: there are a number of biases that may influence the validity of laboratory-based surveillance for antimicrobial resistance. our objective was to  evaluate the potential magnitude of bias in reporting of etiologic agents and their resistance rates associated with inclusion of multiple patient samples and  non-random timing and location of sampling. methods: all urine cultures submitted to a regional laboratory in the calgary health region during 2004 and 2005 were studied. comparisons were then made using either the overall cohort or different  subgroups compared with the "reference" or gold standard population where only the first isolate per patient per year per species was included. results: overall 56,897 organisms were cultured at > or =104 cfu/ml from 53,548 samples from 35,890 patients; 39,835 organisms were included in the reference cohort. escherichia coli was reported in 37,246 (65.5%) of overall cohort and 28,257 (70.9%) of the reference cohort. therefore, the overall cohort resulted in a relative underestimation of the importance of e. coli as the principal cause of urinary tract infections by 8%. similarly, reported rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents most notably ciprofloxacin [6,480/52,544 (12.3%) vs. 2,647/37,086 (7.1%)], gentamicin [2,991/48,070 (6.2%) vs. 1,567/34,608 (4.5%)], and ceftriaxone [1,737/44,922 (3.9%) vs. 889/32,745 (2.7%)] were higher in the overall than in the reference cohorts. there were large differences in both the distribution of organisms and rates of resistance associated with sampling during different times of the day, week, and year as well as from acute care hospitals and outpatient clinics (p< or =0.001). conclusions: reports from laboratory-based surveillance studies may be biased depending on the population studied and method of sampling employed. care must be taken in interpreting results of surveillance  studies that do not protect from these major sources of bias.

TI  == three novel highly charged copper-based biocides: safety and efficacy against healthcare-associated organisms.
AB  == objectives: we investigated three novel highly charged copper-based inorganic biocidal formulations for their activity against organisms highly relevant to healthcare-associated infection. methods: the three copper-based formulations were tested: (i) against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), legionella pneumophila, acinetobacter calcoaceticus/baumannii (accb), glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus and spores of clostridium difficile in time-kill assays; (ii) for their ability to decontaminate ultramicrofibre (umf) cloths; and (iii) for their cytotoxicity to human skin and intestinal epithelial cells. results: all three copper-based formulations were potently biocidal down to concentrations of 1 ppm for both stationary- and log-phase organisms, and they were all active against c. difficile spores. at 150 ppm, they achieved a complete (>6 log10) kill of mrsa and accb mostly within 1 h. this biocidal activity was not achieved by copper sulphate or the inorganic binders used in the formulations. all three copper-based formulations completely decontaminated umf cloths containing mrsa, accb or c. difficile spores, suggesting that any of these copper-based formulations would be highly beneficial in the healthcare environment. all three  copper-based formulations and copper sulphate were not cytotoxic to human epithelial cells up to concentrations of 100-200 ppm. conclusions: all three of the novel copper-based biocidal formulations, but not their components (copper sulphate and inorganic binders), have potent activity against organisms highly relevant to healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of heparin on common respiratory pathogens.
AB  == aim: the mucolytic, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic properties of inhaled heparin may benefit patients with burns and cystic fibrosis. we assessed the antibacterial effects of unfractionated heparin. methods: stored clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii (n =4), candida albicans (n = 5), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), klebsiella pneumoniae (n =4), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n=3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7) were subcultured on horse blood agar, incubated at 35 degrees c overnight, then inoculated into trypticase soy broth to a density of 1 mcfarland standard. dilutions of unfractionated heparin (containing 250- 7500 u) and 100 microl of the 1.0 mcfarland standard broth were  incubated at 35 degrees c overnight in microtitre plates and then subcultured on  horse blood agar using 1 microl standard loops. colonies (representing viable organisms) were counted. results: heparin produced dose-dependent growth inhibition of three of seven s. pneumoniae isolates (complete inhibition at 2500u dose per 200 microl) and one of five h. influenzae isolates (complete inhibition  at 7500 u dose per 200 microl), but no inhibition of other isolates. conclusions: unfractionated heparin is unlikely to have antibacterial effects because of its unpredictable inhibition of growth of common respiratory pathogens.

TI  == resistance to disinfectants in epidemiologically defined clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == decreased susceptibility to biocides may contribute to epidemic spread of acinetobacter baumannii in the hospital. this study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of different clinical a. baumannii strains to disinfectants. twenty a. baumannii strains were examined, ten of which were outbreak-related and ten that were sporadic. clinical isolates were selected on the basis of demonstrating a unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern. the in-vitro activities of propanol, combination of 1-propanol, 2-propanol and mecetronium ethylsulphate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp)-iodine, triclosan and chlorhexidine were determined using a broth macrodilution method. exposure times to the disinfectant ranged from 15 s to 2 min and concentrations ranged from undiluted to a 1:4000 dilution in order to investigate the impact of inadvertent dilution that might occur in clinical practice. five american type culture collection (atcc) type strains (a. baumannii, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus) were used as controls. all disinfectants inhibited growth of all isolates at concentrations and contact times recommended by the respective manufacturer. with most of the disinfectants  tested, a relevant number of viable bacteria remained if contact times < 30s or diluted agents were used. no significant differences in susceptibility between outbreak-related and sporadic strains were detected, but larger studies would be  required to confirm this. resistance to currently used disinfectants is probably  not a major factor in the epidemic spread of a. baumannii. however, even minor deviations from the recommended procedures leading to decreased concentrations or exposure times may play a role in nosocomial cross-transmission.

TI  == new strategies for combating multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is a problem that continues to challenge the healthcare sector. in particular, multidrug resistance is now common in familiar pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as emerging pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii. new antibiotics and new therapeutic strategies are needed to address this challenge. advances in identifying new sources of antibiotic natural products and expanding antibiotic chemical diversity are providing chemical leads for new drugs. inhibitors of resistance mechanisms and microbial virulence are orthogonal strategies that are also generating new chemicals that can extend the life of existing antibiotics. this new chemistry, coupled with a growing understanding of the mechanisms, origins and distribution of antibiotic resistance, position us to tackle the challenges of antibiotic resistance in the 21st century.

TI  == prediction of specific pathogens in patients with sepsis: evaluation of treat, a  computerized decision support system.
AB  == background: prediction of bacterial infections and their pathogens allows for early, directed investigation and treatment. we assessed the ability of treat, a  computerized decision support system, to predict specific pathogens. methods: treat uses data available within the first few hours of infection presentation in a causal probabilistic network to predict sites of infection and specific pathogens. we included 3529 patients (920 with microbiologically documented infections) participating in the observational and interventional trials of the treat system in israel, germany and italy. discriminatory performance of treat to predict individual pathogens was expressed by the auc with 95% confidence intervals. calibration was assessed using the hosmer-lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. results: the aucs for gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli, ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 (all significant). adequate calibration was demonstrated for any gram-negative infection and individual bacteria, except for e. coli. discrimination and calibration were acceptable for enterococcus spp. (auc 0.71, 0.65-0.78), but not for staphylococcus aureus (auc 0.63, 0.55-0.71). the few infections caused by candida spp. and clostridium difficile were well predicted (aucs 0.74, 0.54-0.95; and 0.94, 0.88-1.00, respectively). the coverage with treat's recommendation exceeded that observed with physicians' treatment for all  pathogens, except candida spp. conclusions: treat predicted individual pathogens  causing infection well. prediction of s. aureus was inferior to that observed with other pathogens. treat can be used to triage patients by the risk for specific pathogens. the system's predictions enable it to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen identification.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activities of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against aerobic bacterial pathogens from patients with nosocomial infections.
AB  == background and purpose: there is a rapid worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially in nosocomial isolates. this study compared the in vitro activities of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 208 aerobic bacterial pathogens that caused 197 nosocomial infections in 184 patients. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by e test in accordance with the guidelines of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. results:  most (140/208, 67%) of the isolates were facultative gram-negative bacilli. levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the most effective (22/22, 100%) against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus. none of the antibiotics tested were found to be effective (0/25) against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 11 isolates of acinetobacter baumannii that were not pandrug-resistant (pdr), only 9 isolates (9/11, 81%) were sensitive to imipenem and 5 isolates (5/11, 45%) were sensitive to levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime. another 22 isolates of a. baumannii that were pdr were completely resistant to all 6 antibiotics. the majority of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to these 6 antimicrobial agents with 10/11 (91%) sensitive to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, 9/11 (83%) sensitive to ceftazidime, cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, and 8/11 (75%) sensitive to imipenem. conclusions: the majority of the bacterial isolates causing nosocomial infections were found to be sensitive to the 6 antibiotics tested. bacterial isolates of nosocomial infections that were completely resistant to these 6 antibiotics were pdr a. baumannii, pdr p. aeruginosa, and oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. more potent antimicrobial agents are needed to treat infections caused by pdr a. baumannii and pdr p. aeruginosa.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == relationship between immunosuppression and intensive care unit-acquired multidrug-resistant bacteria: a case-control study.
AB  == objective: to determine the relationship between immunosuppression and intensive  care unit (icu)-acquired multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria. design: retrospective case-control study based on prospectively collected data. setting:  a 30-bed medical and surgical icu. patients: all patients hospitalized >48 hrs in the icu were eligible during a 2-yr period. interventions: immunosuppression was  defined as active solid or hematologic malignancy, leucopenia, or chronic immunosuppressive treatment. mdr bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime- or imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extending spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. mdr bacteria screening (nasal, anal, and axilla swabs and tracheal aspirate in intubated patients) was performed at icu admission and weekly. only mdr bacteria isolated >48 hrs after icu admission were taken into account; duplicates were excluded. isolation measures were applied in all patients at icu admission, in patients with mdr bacteria, and in patients with immunosuppression. immunosuppressed patients (cases) were matched (1:1) with immunocompetent patients (controls) according to all the following criteria: age +/-5 yrs, simplified acute physiology score ii +/-5, duration of icu stay +/-3 days, and category of admission (medical/surgical). risk factors for icu-acquired mdr bacteria were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. measurements and main results: of 1,065 eligible patients, nine patients were excluded for absence of mdr bacteria screening at icu admission. one hundred thirty-three (12%) patients were immunosuppressed, and 128 (96%) of them were successfully matched. mean time between icu admission and first icu-acquired mdr bacteria was 12 +/- 9 days. incidence of mdr bacteria was  significantly higher in cases than in controls (22 vs. 12 mdr bacteria/1000 icu days, p = .004). however, immunosuppression was not independently associated with icu-acquired mdr bacteria.multivariate analysis identified prior antibiotic treatment and antibiotic treatment in the icu as risk factors for icu-acquired mdr bacteria (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.9 [1-3.6], p = .003; 11 [1.4-83], p = .02; respectively). conclusions: immunosuppression is not independently associated with icu-acquired mdr bacteria. however, infection control measures used in our icu may have influenced this result.

TI  == a comparison of available and investigational antibiotics for complicated skin infections and treatment-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus.
AB  == this article compares vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecyline, dalbavancin, telavancin, ceftobiprole, oritavancin, and ramoplanin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is administered intravenously, and is the mainstay of treatment for mrsa and csssi. while not available in the u.s., teicoplanin, another glycopeptide antibiotic, can be administered intramuscularly and has simpler dosing and monitoring requirements than vancomycin. quinupristin/dalfopristin treats vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) infections but inhibits cytochrome p450 a3p4, and has only modest activity against mrsa pneumonia. daptomycin effectively treats csssi but not pneumonia caused by mrsa, and is effective against all strains of staphylococcus. linezolid, available orally and  intravenously, is approved to treat community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia,  csssi, and infections caused by mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci including infections with concurrent bacteraemia and vree tigecycline, a glycylcycline derived from minocycline, has been approved by the fda to treat csssi and complicated intraabdominal infections, and might be effective against acinetobacter baumannii; its primary side effect is digestive upset. dalbavancin, effective against mrsa and administered intravenously once weekly, possesses coverage similar to vancomycin. telavancin deploys multiple mechanisms of action  and is effective against mrsa and gram-positive bacteria resistant to vancomycin. ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin effective against mrsa, has few side effects. oritavancin demonstrates similar activity to vancomycin but possesses extended activity against vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus and enterococci. ramoplanin, a macrocyclic depsipeptide, is unstable in the bloodstream but can be taken orally to treat clostridium difficile colitis.

AB  == background and objective: bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of copd (aecopd). this study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of aecopd. methods: medical records from 494 episodes of aecopd in patients admitted to the national taiwan university hospital from january 2000 to june 2004 were reviewed. severity of copd was classified according to the 2003 global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease guideline. results: potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of aecopd. the predominant bacteria were klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%),  pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), enterobacter species (6.1%) and staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). the incidence of streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. k. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage i copd (39.1%) than stage ii  (16.6%), iii (13.8%) and iv (9.4%). no glucose non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage i patients. multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that p. aeruginosa (odds ratio (or) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.21-8.38), intubation (or 14.81; 95% ci: 5.08-43.12) and age (or  1.1; 95% ci: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. conclusions: klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with aecopd in taiwan, with the former being more commonly  isolated from mild copd and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. these results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with aecopd.

TI  == management of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multiresistant bacteria.
AB  == purpose of review: the inappropriate choice of antibiotics (in nearly one third of episodes) is the most important risk factor for death. traditionally, a narrow-spectrum drug was used first, and the most potent drugs were reserved for  subsequent use. recent findings: as multidrug resistance increases in the intensive care unit in patients treated for nosocomial pneumonia, costs, mortality, and morbidity are rising. although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii are frequently considered together, they have different virulence, risk factors and susceptibilities, requiring different antimicrobial choices. assessment of clinical resolution should be differentiated in the presence of acute lung injury. in the absence of biochemical markers, oxygenation and core temperature should guide therapeutic decisions. summary: as ventilator-associated pneumonia increases, empiric therapy should be based on local pathogen etiology and antibiotic resistant patterns. a new approach to consider is to start with a high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotic and then tailor the individual therapy based on microbiological results and clinical resolution. with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics available in empiric therapy tailored after reassessment of the patient, there is hope for reducing costs, length of stay and mortality whereas the emergence of resistance will be minimized.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance surveillance: vira study 2006].
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two vira studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. methods: in february 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus  influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (365), pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and acinetobacter baumannii (92). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. susceptibility was determined with  a broth microdilution method. results: among the non-penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). among mrsa, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin mic of 4  microg/ml. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli was 12.1%. resistance of a. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). conclusion: these results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.

TI  == [the clinical features of postoperative ventilator-associated pneumonia after lung surgery].
AB  == objective: to investigate the clinical features of postoperative ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) after lung surgery. methods: of 104 patients who had undergone lung surgery and been treated with ventilator in our surgical intensive care unit between january 2003 and march 2005, 35 patients met with the criteria of both vap and postoperative pneumonia (pop), and 41 cases had no evidences of pneumonia. the clinical and laboratory data of all 76 cases were  recorded and analyzed by a statistical software package (spss). results: the diagnosis of postoperative vap was established clinically in 35 patients (46.1%), and etiologically in 33 cases. compared to the patients without postoperative vap, the patients with postoperative vap had a significantly longer mean interval between intubation and operation [(2.7 +/- 2.9) days vs. (1.6 +/- 1.7) days, p =  0.039], a longer duration of mechanical ventilation [(32.2 +/- 37.7) days vs. (4.2 +/- 2.9) days, p < 0.001], and higher morbidity (20.0% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.013). there was a significant difference in mean duration of mechanical ventilation between the 15 cases of early-onset vap and 20 cases of late-onset vap (17 +/- 15 days vs. 43 +/- 46 days, p = 0.042). among the initially detected pathogen, staphylococcus aureus remains the most common gram-positive coccus whereas acinetobacter baumannii took the place of pseudomonas aeruginosa as the top gram-negative rod. conclusion: postoperative vap after lung surgery has different clinical features from vap in medical icu.

TI  == antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
AB  == in the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-o-alpha-l-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. on the other hand, both dna virus herpes simplex (hsv) and rna virus parainfluenza-3 (pi-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using madin-darby bovine  kidney and vero cell lines. according to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against s. aureus and e. faecalis with mic values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by e. coli (2 microg/ml), k. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), a. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and b. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited  c. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. however, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards pi-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (cpe).

TI  == tigecycline: a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  == tigecycline is a new glycyclcycline antimicrobial recently approved for use in the usa, europe and elsewhere. while related to the tetracyclines, tigecycline overcomes many of the mechanisms responsible for resistance to this class. it demonstrates favourable in vitro potency against a variety of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including those frequently demonstrating resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobials. this includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae,  vancomycin-resistant enterococci, acinetobacter baumannii, beta-lactamase producing strains of haemophilis influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. in contrast, minimum inhibitory concentrations for pseudomonas and proteus spp. are markedly elevated. tigecycline is administered parenterally twice daily. randomised, controlled trials have demonstrated that tigecycline is non-inferior to the comparators for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, as well as complicated intra-abdominal infections. the most frequent and problematic side effect associated with its administration to date has been nausea and/or vomiting.

TI  == patterns of antimicrobial resistance in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in turkey.
AB  == background: several studies have reported higher rates of antimicrobial resistance among isolates from intensive care units than among isolates from general patient-care areas. the aims of this study were to review the pathogens associated with nosocomial infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in turkey and to summarize rates of antimicrobial resistance  in the most common pathogens. the survey was conducted over a period of twelve months in a tertiary-care teaching hospital located in the south-eastern part of  turkey, gaziantep. a total of 871 clinical specimens from 615 adult patients were collected. from 871 clinical specimens 771 bacterial and fungal isolates were identified. results: most commonly isolated microorganisms were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%), candida species (15%) and staphylococcus aureus (12.9%). among the gram-negative microorganisms p. aeruginosa were mostly resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (71.3-98.1%), while acinetobacter baumannii were  resistant in all cases to piperacillin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. isolates of  s. aureus were mostly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, and methicillin (82-95%), whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci were 98.6% resistant to methicillin and in all cases resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline. conclusion: in order to reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in icus, monitoring and optimization of antimicrobial use in hospitals are strictly recommended. therefore local resistance surveillance programs are of most value in developing appropriate therapeutic guidelines for specific infections and patient types.

TI  == efficacy of super-oxidized water fogging in environmental decontamination.
AB  == the efficacy of decontamination using sterilox fog was assessed against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii. ceramic tiles were inoculated with the test organisms and, once dried, were subjected to sterilox fogging using a stationary vaporizing machine sited at a distance of 3m for 10 min and then left for a further hour. in a second experiment using the same organisms, the first 10-min fogging period was followed by a directed fogging period of 30s at a distance of 1m. organisms were cultured  from the tiles, plated on to tryptone soya agar and incubated for 48 h. initial counts of approximately 10(9) colony-forming units/ml for both organisms were reduced approximately 10(4) fold for mrsa and 10(5.8) fold for a. baumannii when  using a single fogging. the second fogging resulted in 10(6.8)-fold reductions for both organisms. sterilox fog is safe and simple to use, and can reduce levels of nosocomial pathogens by a factor of almost 10(7). it is worthy of clinical evaluation in clinical settings to determine whether it maintains its microbicidal effects against a variety of organisms on different surfaces.

TI  == bacteria recovered from patients admitted to a deployed u.s. military hospital in baghdad, iraq.
AB  == the predominant bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibilities were surveyed from a  deployed, military, tertiary care facility in baghdad, iraq, serving u.s. troops, coalition forces, and iraqis, from august 2003 through july 2004. we included cultures of blood, wounds, sputum, and urine, for a total of 908 cultures; 176 of these were obtained from u.s. troops. the bacteria most commonly isolated from u.s. troops were coagulase-negative staphylococci, accounting for 34% of isolates, staphylococcus aureus (26%), and streptococcal species (11%). the 732 cultures obtained from the predominantly iraqi population were klebsiella pneumoniae (13%), acinetobacter baumannii (11%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%); coagulase-negative staphylococci represented 21% of these isolates. these  differences in prevalence were all statistically significant, when compared in chi2 analyses (p < 0.05). antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated broad resistance among the gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == multiple-drug-resistant bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: prevalence, risk factors, and outcome.
AB  == objective: to determine prevalence, risk factors, and effect on outcome of multiple-drug-resistant (mdr) bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. design: prospective, observational, cohort study. setting: thirty-bed medical intensive care unit (icu) in a university hospital. methods: all chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients  with acute exacerbation who required intubation and mechanical ventilation for >48 hrs were eligible during a 4-yr period. patients with pneumonia or other causes of acute respiratory failure were not eligible. in all patients, quantitative tracheal aspirate was performed at icu admission (positive at 10 colony-forming units [cfu]/ml). mdr bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime- or imipenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli. all patients received empirical antibiotic treatment at icu admission. univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine variables associated with mdr bacteria and variables associated with icu mortality. results: a total of 857 patients were included, and 304 bacteria were isolated (>/=10 cfu/ml) in 260 patients (30%), including 75 mdr bacteria (24%) in 69 patients (8%). when patients with mdr bacteria were compared with patients without mdr bacteria, previous antimicrobial treatment (odds ratio [or], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [95% ci], 1.2-4.7; p = .013) and previous intubation (or, 31; 95% ci, 12-82; p <  .001) were independently associated with mdr bacteria. when patients with bacteria other than mdr or patients with no bacteria were used as a reference group, these risk factors were still independently associated with mdr bacteria.  although icu mortality rate was higher in patients with mdr bacteria than in patients without mdr bacteria (44% vs. 25%; p = .001; or, 2.3; 95% ci, 1.4-3.8),  mdr bacteria were not independently associated with icu mortality. inappropriate  initial antibiotic treatment (88% vs. 5%; p = <.001; or, 6.7; 95% ci, 3.8-12) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (23% vs. 5%; p = <.001; or, 1.3; 95% ci, 1-1.8) rates were significantly higher in patients with mdr bacteria than in patients with bacteria other than mdr. inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment was independently associated with increased icu mortality (or, 7.1; 95% ci, 1.9-30; p = .003). conclusion: mdr bacteria are common in patients with acute exacerbation  of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. previous antimicrobial treatment and previous intubation are independent risk factors for mdr bacteria. although mdr bacteria are not independently associated with icu mortality, inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment is an independent risk factor for icu mortality in these patients. further studies are needed to determine whether broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment is cost-effective in these patients.

TI  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == as a consequence of antibiotic overuse and misuse, nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria represent a physician's nightmare throughout the  world. no newer antimicrobials active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the main multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen, are available or under investigation. the only exceptions are linezolid, some newer glycopeptides (dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin) and daptomycin (a lipopeptide), which are active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains, as well as tigecycline, a potent in vitro glycylcycline against mrsa, vre, acinetobacter baumannii and entended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)+ enterobacteriaceae. colistin, an antibiotic of the 1950s has been rediscovered by intensive care unit physicians for use against esbl+ enterobacteriaceae, as well as against multidrug-resistant  p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates. although success rates with colistin range between 50 and 73%, almost all studies are retrospective. immunostimulation efforts against s. aureus are still under development. as antibiotic research and development stagnate, rational policies for prescribing existing antibiotics plus strict infection control are the current mainstay efforts for preventing and combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

TI  == using local microbiologic data to develop institution-specific guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == background: while current guidelines recommend consideration of local microbiologic data when selecting empiric treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap), few specifics of how to do this have been offered. methods: we conducted a retrospective analysis of hap pathogens in 111 consecutive patients who acquired hap during july to december 2004 and had a corresponding positive culture finding for a bacterial pathogen. these data were used to develop institution-specific guidelines. results: the most common bacteria identified were staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa,  which were associated with 38%, 25%, and 19% of pneumonias, respectively. susceptibility of gram-negative bacteria to piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime  was 80% and 81%, respectively. the isolation of organisms resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime was significantly more frequent in patients who had been hospitalized > or = 10 days. of gram-negative isolates resistant to  piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime, ciprofloxacin was active against < 10%, while amikacin was active against > 80%. new treatment guidelines were developed  that divided the american thoracic society/infectious diseases society of america "late onset/risk of multidrug-resistant pathogens" group of patients into two subcategories: "early-late" pneumonias (< 10 days of hospitalization) and "late-late" pneumonias (> or = 10 days of hospitalization). guideline-directed treatment regimens would be predicted to provide adequate initial therapy for > 90% of late-onset pneumonias at our institution. conclusions: current guidelines  suggest adding either an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone to beta-lactam therapy for empiric gram-negative coverage. however, in our institution, adding ciprofloxacin would not appreciably enhance the likelihood of providing initial appropriate antibiotic coverage. this underscores the importance of employing a systematic analysis of local data when developing treatment guidelines.

TI  == visible-light-induced bactericidal activity of a nitrogen-doped titanium photocatalyst against human pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (tio(2)) substrates is induced primarily by uv light irradiation. recently, nitrogen- and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination. their antibacterial activity, however, remains  to be quantified. in this study, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates have superior visible-light-induced bactericidal activity against escherichia coli compared to pure tio(2) and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates. we also found that protein- and light-absorbing contaminants partially reduce the bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates due to their light-shielding effects. in the pathogen-killing experiment, a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens, including shigella flexneri, listeria  monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and acinetobacter baumannii, were killed by visible-light-illuminated nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates than by pure tio(2) substrates. these findings suggest that nitrogen-doped tio(2) has potential application in the development of alternative disinfectants for environmental and medical usages.

TI  == microbiology of postoperative infections.
AB  == background: surgical infections, accounting for approximately one quarter of all  nosocomial infections, contribute to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs. clinical failure of antibiotic treatment often is associated with increasing drug resistance. methods: non-duplicated microbial isolates obtained at our institution from surgical patients were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the sceptor system in 2001-2002 and the phoenix system in 2003-2005. epidemiologic data were extracted using epicenter and powerlab. during selected periods, genetic and biochemical characterization was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, colony blot hybridization, gene amplification and sequencing, isoelectric focusing, and enzyme kinetics. results: the specimens were most commonly isolated from infections at surgical sites (24.0%), the urinary tract (19.0%), and blood stream (10.6%). isolates of escherichia coli showed an increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, whereas the prevalence of resistant staphylococcus aureus generally declined. highly aggressive multi-drug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were widespread, although colistin remained effective in 100% of cases. a significant  increase was seen in infections attributable to s. epidermidis and candida albicans. the overall number of enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased continuously, and new resistance traits emerged. it appeared that the tem-92 determinant moved from enterobacteriaceae to nonfermenting gram-negative rods such as acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: the number and type of antimicrobial-resistance determinants are increasing.

TI  == bacillus spp. among hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies: clinical features, epidemics and outcomes.
AB  == between april 2000 and may 2005, 350 bacteraemic episodes occurred among patients treated in our haematology unit. two hundred and twenty-eight of these episodes were caused by gram-positive pathogens, most commonly coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. one hundred and twenty-two episodes were due to gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance of escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bacillus bacteraemias constituted 12 of these episodes occurring in 12 patients, and accounted for 3.4% of all bacteraemic episodes. of the 12 strains evaluated, seven were bacillus licheniformis, three were bacillus cereus and two were bacillus pumilus. seven episodes presented with bloodstream infection, three with pneumonia, one with severe abdominal pain and deterioration of liver function, and one with a catheter-related bloodstream infection. b. licheniformis was isolated from five patients who had been hospitalized at the same time. this outbreak was related to non-sterile cotton wool used during skin disinfection. b. cereus and b. licheniformis isolates were susceptible to cefepime, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, but b. pumilus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except  for quinolones and vancomycin. two deaths were observed. in conclusion, bacillus  spp. may cause serious infections, diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and high  morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. both b. cereus and b. licheniformis may be among the 'new' gram-positive pathogens to cause serious infection in patients with neutropenia.

TI  == [preventing nosocomial infections. dressings soaked in polyhexamethylene biguanide (phmb)].
AB  == polyhexamethlene biguanide (phmb) is an antibacterial agent included in the chlorhexidine group which is active against a wide number of microorganisms including staphylococcus aureus methycilin resistant (mrsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) and acinetobacter baumannii which all cause antibiotic-resistant infections. traditionally gauze dressings have been used to  cover and protect wounds although their porous structure does not constitute an efficient barrier against bacterial penetration, especially when a dressing becomes wet due to the effects of a wound oozing and draining. recently the use of a dressing soaked in a 0.2% phmb solution which works as a biological barrier  against pathogenic agents has been introduced in clinical practice. on the one hand, this phmb soaked dressing inhibits bacterial growth in the areas where it is applied and, on the other hand, it prevents the penetration of microorganisms  through the dressing itself. simultaneously while a phmb soaked dressing carries  out these actions, it creates an environment favorable to the proliferation of the normal flora found in the epidermis. as opposed to porous gauze dressings, a  phmb dressing remains active during 72 hours even in wet environs. its wide anti-micro-bacterial range prevents infections in surgical, acute or chronic wounds and in any type of intra-corporal access susceptible to infection, such as by means of intravascular catheters, tracheotomies, or thoracic tubes. a phmb dressing can also be used as a primary covering to treat a chronic wound since it does not interfere in the process of tissue reepithelization.

TI  == culture-proven bacterial meningitis in elderly patients in southern taiwan: clinical characteristics and prognostic factors.
AB  == the epidemiologic landscape of causative pathogens and clinical characteristics of bacterial meningitis varies with several clinical factors including preceding/pre-existent medical and/or surgical conditions, modes of contraction,  geographic distributions, status of vaccinations, the study time periods and differences among age groups. in order to delineate the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in senior adults (ages > or =60 y/o) in southern taiwan, we analyzed the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of 64 senior adults (42 men and 22 women, aged 60-80 years) with bacterial meningitis collected over a period of 13 years at our hospital. the prognostic factors between fatal and non-fatal groups of patients were compared. twenty-seven of the 64 patients belonged to a nosocomial infection group, and the other 37 comprised a community-acquired infection group. sixty percent (39/64) of the patients had a post-neurosurgical state as the most preceding event prior to infection. liver disease (13) and diabetes mellitus (6) were the most common underlying conditions of the other 25  patients with spontaneous meningitis. of these 64 patients, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae (18), acinetobacter baumannii (5), escherichia coli (5), and enterobacter species (5) were the most commonly implicated gram-negative pathogens. staphylococcus (s.) aureus infection was increasing during the study period. the therapeutic results of this group of patients showed a mortality rate of 38% (24/64). the presence of septic shock was the most significant prognostic  factor. in conclusion, for this study group, a post-neurosurgical state was the single most important preceding event for senior adults developing bacterial meningitis. of the implicated pathogens, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus were the most common gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, respectively. the therapeutic result of this specific group of patients showed a high mortality rate; however, the small case number and possible bias of case selection have limited the analytical conclusions of this study.

TI  == tigecycline: first of a new class of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == tigecycline is the first commercially available member of the glycylcyclines, a new class of antimicrobial agents. the glycylcyclines are derivatives of the tetracycline antibiotics, with structural modifications that allow for potent gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic activity, including certain multidrug-resistant strains. the enhanced activity can be attributed to stronger  binding affinity and enhanced protection against several mechanisms of resistance that affect other antibiotic classes such as tetracyclines. tigecycline exhibits  generally bacteriostatic action by reversibly binding to the 30s ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein translation. in vitro activity has been demonstrated against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant and glycopeptide-intermediate and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococci. multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens, such as acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli, are typically highly susceptible to tigecycline. the drug also has displayed significant activity against many clinically important anaerobic organisms. this  agent demonstrates a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and minimal drug interactions, and is generally well tolerated, with nausea being the most common  adverse event. it was approved in june 2005 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (sssis) and complicated intraabdominal infections.  currently, a limited number of broad-spectrum antimicrobials are available to combat multidrug-resistant organisms. the addition of new agents is essential to  limiting the spread of these pathogens and improving outcomes in patients with these types of infections. tigecycline has demonstrated promising results in initial in vitro and clinical studies for sssis and complicated intraabdominal infections; however, further clinical experience will clarify its role as a broad-spectrum agent.

TI  == [nosocomial pneumonia due to acinetobacter baumannii].
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is a significant cause of nosocomial pneumonia, especially late ventilator-associated pneumonia. in spain, a. baumannii is the third leading pathogen after pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. risk factors for pneumonia due to a. baumannii are head injury, neurosurgery, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration, and previous antibiotic therapy. definitive diagnosis requires respiratory samples and invasive techniques with quantitative cultures to differentiate true infections from simple colonizations. the crude mortality of patients with ventilator-associated a. baumannii pneumonia is high, although the attributable mortality is controversial. adequate empirical antimicrobial therapy of a. baumannii pneumonia is a protective factor, even though the therapeutic options are often limited. the treatment of choice is imipenem and sulbactam may be considered an acceptable alternative. nowadays, colistin is the treatment of choice in a. baumannii pneumonia caused by panresistant strains. the associations of imipenem and rifampin or imipenem and sulbactam may be acceptable alternatives to colistin in infections caused by these strains. surveillance measures are essential to eradicate this multidrug-resistant pathogen in outbreaks and reduce the number of episodes in endemic situations. although these measures are important throughout the hospital, intensive care units are especially high-risk areas.

AB  == respiratory infections in intubated patients can derive from endogenous or exogenous sources. the major route for acquiring endemic ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is oropharyngeal colonization by endogenous flora and leakage of  contaminated secretions into the lower respiratory tract. however, a not inconsiderable percentage of vap results from exogenous nosocomial colonization,  especially pneumonias caused by resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as by legionella spp or filamentous fungi, such as aspergillus. this article reviews the pathogenesis of vap and the role of the intensive care environment as a source of pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == are therapeutic ultrasound units a potential vector for nosocomial infection?
AB  == background and purpose: nosocomial infections present a widespread problem in today's healthcare environment, with a significant number of patients acquiring an infection annually. with the contemporary transition of immunocompromised and  high-risk patients to community-based care, therapeutic ultrasound has the potential to be a vector of infection in the physiotherapy setting. the purpose of the present study was to determine the degree of contamination on therapeutic  ultrasound transducer heads and ultrasound gel after routine clinical use, and to evaluate the efficacy of recommended infection control procedures. method: the study consisted of two phases. using a prospective cross-sectional design, microbiological cultures were obtained from 44 transducer heads and 43 gels. subjects were drawn from a variety of physiotherapy practice settings. all samples containing more than five colony forming units per cm2 were considered contaminated. following these measurements, a repeated-measures design was used to re-evaluate the 44 transducer heads for the amount and type of bacteria present after cleaning with a 70% alcohol wipe. results: twenty-seven per cent of transducer heads and 28% of gels were contaminated. transducer heads showed fairly low levels of contamination across the sample, with the majority of organisms isolated found in normal skin and environmental flora. gels were heavily contaminated with opportunistic and potentially pathogenic organisms, including stenotrophomonas maltophilia, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii and rhodotorula mucilaginosa. no multi-resistant organisms were identified. cleaning with 70% alcohol significantly reduced the level of contamination on transducer heads (p < 0.01). conclusions: therapeutic ultrasound equipment is a potential vector for nosocomial infection in physiotherapy patients. the risk of infection from transducer heads can be effectively removed  by cleaning with 70% alcohol between patients. further research into possible strategies to reduce the risk of infection from ultrasound gels is needed.

TI  == diagnosis and treatment of catheter-related infections in paediatric oncology: an update.
AB  == otherwise unexplained clinical signs of infection in patients with long-term tunnelled or totally implanted central venous access devices (cvads) are suspected to be cvad-associated. diagnostic methods include catheter swabs, blood cultures and cultures of the catheter tip or port reservoir. in the case of a suspected cvad-related bloodstream infection in paediatric oncology patients, in-situ treatment without prompt removal of the device can be attempted. removal  of the cvad should be considered if bacteraemia persists or relapses > or = 72 h  after the initiation of (in-vitro effective) antibacterial therapy administered through the line. timely removal of the device is also recommended if the patient suffers from a complicated infection, or if staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii or candida spp. are isolated from blood cultures. duration of therapy depends on the immunological recovery of the patient, the pathogen isolated and the presence of related complications, such as thrombosis, pneumonia, endocarditis and osteomyelitis. antibiotic lock techniques in addition to systemic treatment are beneficial for gram-positive infections. although prospectively controlled studies are lacking, the concomitant use of urokinase locks and taurolidine secondary prophylaxis seem to  favour catheter salvage.

TI  == predominance of gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  == background and purpose: while nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of  empirical therapy. this study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis)  surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. methods: during the period from 1996 to 2003 at national cheng kung university hospital, patients with nbsis were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. results: from 1996 to 2003, there were  4,038 episodes of nbsis. the overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of nbsis, respectively. the 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of nbsis), staphylococcus aureus (13%), candida spp. (10%), acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and escherichia coli (8%). oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of s. aureus isolates. in contrast to enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. the emerging antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli. despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. conclusions: in summary, gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing nbsis and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. surveillance of the characteristics of nbsis and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia : rationalizing the approach to empirical therapy.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. it is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. in 1996 the american thoracic society (ats) published guidelines for empirical therapy of hap. this review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ats statement. early diagnosis of hap and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) or protected specimen brush (psb) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic bal/psb in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. since culture results take 2-3 days, initial therapy of hap is by definition empirical. epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus ('core pathogens'). empirical therapy covering only the 'core pathogens' will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. studies that have appeared since the ats statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for hap with multiresistant pathogens. in patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. the most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of hap (>/=5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical  ventilation. multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. to further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance.since the ats statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for hap should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.

AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == the emergence of multidrug resistant acinetobacter species: a major concern in the hospital setting.
AB  == acinetobacter spp. have emerged in recent years as a major cause of nosocomial infections that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. developing resistance patterns have prompted the suggestion that we are closer to the end of the antibiotic era with acinetobacter than with methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (j hosp infect58, 2004, 167).

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a series of 1-alkyl-2-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium bromides against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: to test a series of 1-alkyl-2-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium bromides with alkyl chains containing between 9 and 16 carbons against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. materials and methods: chemical synthesis was based on the reaction of 2,4'-bipyridyl with alkyl bromide. antimicrobial activity of the bipyridyls was measured by growing bacterial cultures on mueller-hinton agar in the presence and absence of inhibitors. results: the compounds were most active against s. aureus. the most active compounds had alkyl chain lengths of between 11 and 16 carbons. methicillin-sensitive s. aureus was more susceptible to the inhibitors than methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). two subclasses of mrsa existed which differed in their susceptibility to the inhibitors. the susceptibility of mrsa strains to the compounds was increased in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine. the activity of the compounds against gram-negative organisms was increased when the membrane-permeabilizing agent sodium citrate was introduced. critical micelle concentrations of the compounds were much higher than minimum inhibitory concentrations of the inhibitors. conclusion: the mechanism of action of the compounds may involve perturbing bacterial membranes.  the resistance of some mrsa strains to the compounds may be related to efflux pumps.

TI  == contamination of patients' files in intensive care units: an indication of strict handwashing after entering case notes.
AB  == background: the extent to which bedside patients' files become contaminated and the range of bacterial flora attributable to contamination in high-risk areas of  the hospital are not known with certainty. the aim of the present study was to determine the degree of contamination of the patient's files and also to analyze  and compare the spectrum of contaminant bacterial flora between the intensive care unit (icu) and surgical wards, the 2 most high-risk areas for nosocomial transmission of infection. methods: microbiologic samples were collected from the exposed outer surface of the patients' files kept bedside in the icu and surgical wards with sterile swabs moistened with sterile normal saline. swabs were cultured within an hour of collection on blood agar and macconkey's agar plates,  which were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. gram-negative bacilli were identified by gram's stain, catalase, oxidase tests, and api 20e and api 20ne. staphylococcus species were identified by gram's stain, catalase test, and tube coagulase test. antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacteria was determined by the disk diffusion technique according to the criteria of national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). results: in icu, 85.2% (87/102) and, in surgical wards, 24.7% (22/89) of patient's files were found to be contaminated with pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria (or, 17.664; 95% ci: 8.050-39.423; p < .0001). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated bacteria (32.3%, 33/102) in icus, whereas staphylococcus aureus was the peak contaminant (11.2%, 10/89) of the files in surgical wards. methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was isolated from 6.8% (7/102) of icu patient's files, whereas only 1.1% (1/89) of patient's files in surgical wards were contaminated with mrsa (or, 6.484; 95% ci: 3.215-13.463; p < .0001). the multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serretia marcesens isolated from the patient's files had the same antibiotic  resistance pattern as of these bacteria isolated from the patients. conclusion: the majority of the patient's files in icus were contaminated often with multidrug-resistant bacteria and even mrsa. contaminated files could be a source  of transmission of infection. to prevent this, handwashing practice should be strictly followed after attending the patient and before entering the case notes  in the patient's file. the maintenance of good hand hygiene by the health care workers (hcws) after handling contaminated files should perhaps be the most prudent approach to prevent patient-patient transmission of infection in high-risk areas including icu and surgical wards.

TI  == advances in the management of pneumonia in the intensive care unit: review of current thinking.
AB  == interventions to prevent pneumonia in the intensive care unit should combine multiple measures targeting the invasive devices, microorganisms and protection of the patient. microbiological investigation is useful for evaluating the quality of the respiratory sample, and permits early modification of the regimen  in light of the microbiological findings. once pneumonia develops, the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen is a vital determinant of outcome. three questions should be formulated: (1) is the patient at risk of acquiring methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, (2) is acinetobacter baumannii a problem in the institution, and (3) is the patient at risk of acquiring pseudomonas aeruginosa? antibiotic therapy should be started immediately and must circumvent any pathogen resistance mechanisms developed after previous antibiotic exposure. therefore, antibiotic choice should be institution-specific and patient-oriented.

TI  == evaluation of a clinical pathway for ventilator-associated pneumonia: changes in  bacterial flora and the adequacy of empiric antibiotics over a three-year period.
AB  == background: evaluation of causative pathogens is vital for optimizing empiric antibiotic therapy of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). based on previous data (ann surg 1998;227:743-755), empiric antibiotics for our vap clinical pathway were modified to target early and late occurring pathogens (ampicillin/sulbactam during the first week of hospitalization; cefepime plus vancomycin afterwards). the objectives of this study were to compare organisms causing vap over a three-year period to previous data, and to determine the adequacy of the empiric antibiotic regimens. methods: a total of 299 critically ill trauma patients with vap over a three-year period were studied retrospectively. the incidence of pathogens causing vap in the study period were  compared to a previously published study of a two-year period in our intensive care unit (icu). sensitivities of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii were evaluated over the study period. the adequacy of empiric antibiotic therapy for each episode of vap was determined. therapy was considered to be adequate if one or more antibiotics had in vitro activity against the organism causing vap. results: statistically significant changes in pathogens included increased staphylococcus aureus (incidence 17% vs. 11%, p = 0.024) and decreased acinetobacter baumannii (11% vs. 22%, p < 0.001). susceptibility patterns were statistically unchanged except for increased resistance of p. aeruginosa to extended-spectrum penicillins (p = 0.016). empiric therapy was adequate in 76% of vap episodes. conclusions: the clinical pathway's empiric antibiotic regimen was associated with only modest changes in organisms causing vap and provided a high rate of adequate empiric coverage.

TI  == post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adults: microbiology, clinical features, and outcomes.
AB  == the clinical data of 62 adult patients who suffered post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis, retrospectively collected over a 16-year period, were studied. cases were divided into two groups based on the date of presentation, the first period being 1986-1993 and the second 1994-2001. fever and progressive  consciousness disturbance were the most consistent clinical features - signs that may also be attributed to other postoperative neurosurgical problems. the common  pathogens included staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii. an increase in polymicrobial infections and multi-antibiotic resistance during the second period was identified. in the first half of the study, mortality was 22%,  and in the second half 36%. adult post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis has become an important clinical problem. the choice of appropriate empirical antibiotics is challenging and must be guided by an awareness of the relative frequency of various pathogens and the increasing incidence of resistant strains. although high mortality rates may, in part, be related to the primary brain pathology, early diagnosis and the timely use of antibiotics based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing are essential for survival.

TI  == outcome analysis of patients requiring mechanical ventilation with severe community-acquired pneumonia and identified bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: severe community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is associated with high mortality. the choice of antibiotics should be guided by the distribution of bacterial pathogens. the purpose of this study was to analyze the causative bacteria and outcomes of patients with severe cap in a medical intensive care unit (micu) in taiwan. the results may provide a basis of guidance for future empirical antibiotic treatments. methods: we enrolled patients with severe cap who were intubated and who required mechanical ventilation in an micu in 2001. only patients with identified bacterial pathogens were included. the bacterial distribution was determined, while differences in age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii scores, and initial pao2/fio2 ratio between surviving and expired patients were compared. results: fifty-nine patients were enrolled and 75 isolates were obtained. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common bacteria (21.3%), followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. staphylococcus aureus (8%) was the most-commonly isolated gram-positive organism, and half of its isolates were oxacillin-resistant (orsa). the overall mortality was 55.9%. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that survivors had a significantly younger age and lower apache ii scores. conclusions: gram-negative  bacilli were the most-common causative pathogens among patients with severe cap requiring mechanical ventilation. antipseudomonal antibiotics or a carbapenem should be considered to cover pseudomonas species, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, and acinetobacter species. if the isolated bacteria are gram-positive, care should be taken to cover the possibility of orsa. old age and higher apache ii scores were associated with higher mortality.

TI  == clinical approach to the patient with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == management of ventilator-associated pneumonia needs to balance the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic overuse with the provision of adequate initial empiric therapy. a clinical diagnosis based on new pulmonary opacity and purulent respiratory secretions plus other signs of inflammation is valuable in screening  for patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. a rational strategy  starts with immediate initiation of adequate antibiotics and collection of respiratory secretions to evaluate the causative organism. as a minimum, an endotracheal aspirate with direct staining and quantitative cultures should be obtained. overall, the need to choose adequate antibiotics correctly and expeditiously calls for the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the choice should be narrowed quickly in the light of microbiologic information. however, some patients (those who develop an infection within 5 days of hospitalization, those without recent antibiotic exposure, and those without hospitalization in the past 3 months) are at low risk of infection by resistant organisms. in that subset, adequate initial selection could be a non-pseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin, since antibiotics should target usual community-acquired organisms in addition to some enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus. coverage of methicillin-resistant s. aureus should be limited only to intensive care units with concomitant index cases and to patients under antibiotic exposure. patients  at risk of pseudomonas aeruginosa (e.g., 1 week of prior hospitalization or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) require initial use of a combination of piperacilin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin, or amikacin plus imipenem, meropenem, or an antipseudomonal cephalosporin. if risk of acinetobacter baumannii exists, one of these agents should be a carbapenem. after 48 hours of therapy, each patient should be re-evaluated based mainly on resolution of hypoxemia and fever  plus the initial microbiologic information. whereas broad-spectrum therapy is initially warranted in many patients, this treatment may be narrowed considerably as culture results identify the causative organism and its sensitivity. recent data suggest that reducing overall treatment duration to a maximum of 1 week is safe, effective and is less likely to promote the growth of resistant organisms in patients who are clinically improving. optimal management should be based on a strategy combining early high doses of an effective agent for a short period of time, which is then simplified in the light of microbiologic information.

TI  == hospital-acquired pneumonia in critically ill patients: factors associated with episodes due to imipenem-resistant organisms.
AB  == background: inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy represents one of the factors associated with mortality of patients suffering from hospital-acquired pneumonia. according to its wide antimicrobial spectrum, imipenem belongs to the  usual antibiotics proposed by current guidelines for such a therapy. however, major changes in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacteria in the intensive care unit (icu) have occurred. our goal was to determine the incidence  of hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) due to imipenem-resistant organism(s) in our icu and to identify factors associated with such a resistance. patients and methods: from january 1994 to december 2001, all consecutive patients admitted to our icu for hap or exhibiting hap during their icu stay were included in an observational cohort. patients with a bacteriologically documented hap were studied. for each causative pathogen, imipenem susceptibility was routinely determined. patients with an hap episode due to at least one imipenem-resistant causative organism were compared with patients who developed hap in which all incriminated pathogens were imipenem susceptible. results: 235 patients were included in our observational cohort. among them, 168 had an hap episode with a bacteriologically proven infection. in 42 patients (25%), at least one causative  organism was resistant to imipenem. the 44 imipenem-resistant organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 15), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13), and acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2). multivariate analysis  identified four significant independent factors associated with resistance of causative organism(s) to imipenem: prior use of a fluoroquinolone (aor = 3.9; 95% ci: 1.8 to 8.8; p < 0.0001), prior use of an aminoglycoside (aor = 2.6; ci: 1.2 to 5.9; p = 0.02), use of invasive blood pressure monitoring (aor = 2.7; ci: 1.0  to 7.0; p = 0.04) and bilateral chest x-ray involvement (aor = 2.6; ci: 1.1 to 5.8; p = 0.02). conclusion: factors associated with potential inadequacy of imipenem used as the single antibiotic for initial empiric treatment for hap were identified. when they are present, imipenem should be either combined with antibiotics such as vancomycin and ciprofloxacin or replaced with another broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimen.

TI  == the role of the intensive care unit environment in the pathogenesis and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia is preceded by lower-respiratory-tract colonization by pathogenic microorganisms that derive from endogenous or exogenous sources. most ventilator-associated pneumonias are the result of exogenous nosocomial colonization, especially, pneumonias caused by resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multi-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, or by legionella species or filamentous fungi, such as aspergillus. exogenous colonization originates from a  very wide variety of animate and inanimate sources in the intensive care unit environment. as a result, a strategic approach that combines measures to prevent  cross-colonization with those that focus on oral hygiene and prevention of microaspiration of colonized oropharyngeal secretions should bring the greatest reduction in the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. this review examines strategies to prevent transmission of environmental pathogens to the vulnerable mechanically-ventilated patient.

TI  == respiratory pathogens in dental plaque of hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases.
AB  == bacterial cultivation studies have shown that dental plaque is a reservoir for respiratory pathogens in intensive care unit patients and in elderly who are debilitated, hospitalized or in a nursing home, placing them at risk of bacterial pneumonia. no information is available, however, concerning dental plaque as a reservoir of putative respiratory pathogens in hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases. supragingival plaque colonization of 34 hospitalized chronic lung-diseased romanian citizens, excluding those with tuberculosis and less than  20 teeth, was therefore assessed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using a selected panel of whole genomic dna probes produced from eight respiratory pathogens and eight oral pathogens. thirty-one lung-healthy dental outpatients served as reference population. respiratory pathogens were detected in plaque from 29 of the 34 (85.3%) hospitalized patients and 12 of the 31 (38.7%) reference population subjects. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacter cloacae occurred significantly (p<0.05) more frequent among the hospitalized patients. hospitalized chronic lung-diseased patients harbored in their supragingival plaque samples bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia significantly (p<0.001) more frequent than lung-healthy dental outpatients. our results indicate that dental plaque in patients with chronic lung diseases often serves as a reservoir of bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia in susceptible individuals.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == purpose of review: this review summarises some of the notable papers on ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) from january 2003 to october 2004. recent findings: ventilator-associated pneumonia remains an important drain on hospital  resources. all population groups are affected, but patients with vap are more likely to be older, sicker, and male, with invasive medical devices in situ. early vap diagnosis is desirable to reduce vap mortality and to retard emergence  of multidrug-resistant microbes. this may be possible using preliminary culture results or intracellular organism in polymorphonuclear cells. in most intensive care units, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii are the commonest organisms isolated in vap. however, causative organisms vary between and within hospitals. consequently, individual intensive care units should develop empirical antibiotic policies to target the pathogenic  bacteria prevalent in their patient populations. preventative strategies aimed at reducing aerodigestive tract colonisation by pathogenic organisms, and also their subsequent aspiration, are becoming increasingly important. educating medical staff about these simple measures is therefore pertinent. to reduce the occurrence of multidrug-resistant organisms, limiting the duration of antibiotic  treatment to 8 days and antimicrobial rotation should be contemplated. empirical  therapy with antipseudomonal penicillins plus beta-lactamase inhibitors should be considered. if methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus vap is a possibility,  linezolid may be better than vancomycin. summary: prevention remains the key to reducing vap prevalence.

TI  == risk factors of mortality for nosocomial pneumonia: importance of initial anti-microbial therapy.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia is a common nosocomial infection and has high mortality rate. risk factors of mortality of nosocomial pneumonia were studied in 132 hospitalised patients who developed nosocomial pneumonia. the overall mortality rate was 64/132, 48.5%. of the 11 risk factors univariately associated with mortality due to nosocomial pneumonia, only the inappropriate initial anti-microbial therapy, high simplified acute physiology score and multiple organ failures remained significant after stepwise logistic regression. gram-negative bacilli were still the most pre-dominant causative microbiologic agents of nosocomial pneumonia with pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%), acinetobacter baumannii (18.6%) and escherichia coli (5.9%) being the three most predominant pathogens. a. baumannii were significantly more predominant among non-survivors than survivors (13.56 vs. 5.08%, p=0.0418). the incidence rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was 19.5% higher than previous reports. we conclude that inappropriate initial anti-microbial therapy for nosocomial pneumonia is associated with the mortality rate of nosocomial pneumonia, and appropriate anti-microbial therapy improves outcome of nosocomial  pneumonia.

AB  == introduction: the objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the vira study carried out in 2001.  methods: the 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in february 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89) and enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (346), pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and acinetobacter baumannii (130). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. results: the number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). global methicillin-resistance in s. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the e. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. one p. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the e-test mbl assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. the strains of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. conclusion: these results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. this emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use  of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == hospital gowns as a vehicle for bacterial dissemination in an intensive care unit.
AB  == the microbiota from the uniforms of 31 professionals from the general intensive care unit was analyzed. the samples were collected in duplicate at the beginning  and at the end of the work period. total viable counts of microorganisms were determined; there was a significant increase in the counts at the end of the period, when compared with those obtained at the beginning. no significant difference was observed between the first and second counts obtained from the cuffs. however, differences were observed for the samples from the abdominal region. among the isolated pathogens 11/18 were staphylococcus aureus, 2/18 were  acinetobacter baumannii, 2/18 were klebsiela pneumoniae and 1/18 were serratia rubidae. some of these isolates were multi-resistant to antibiotics. emphasis should be placed on reducing the spread of these pathogens in the hospital, making sure that biosafety protocols are followed by the staff.

TI  == comparison of trends of resistance rates over 3 years calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of a given species from a patient.
AB  == we compared trends of annual resistance rates calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumannii per patient over a 3-year period from 2001 through 2003. antimicrobial susceptibility results of inpatients were extracted from a computerized database. annual resistance rates of a species were calculated by two methods: (i) from results for all isolates, even those from patients with multiple isolates in a given year and (ii) from results for the first isolate from a patient in a given year, regardless of susceptibility profile or specimen type. rates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) did not differ among all isolates (79.9, 78.8 and 79.6%; p = 0.86), but decreased for the first isolate per patient (70.2, 65.7, and 64.1%; p = 0.006) over time. annual duplication rates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) decreased (39.6, 37.6, and 31.7%; p = 0.01), but those of mrsa increased significantly (64.3, 67.8, and 68.9%; p = 0.004). rates of cefotaxime-resistant k. pneumoniae did not  differ over time by either method, and rates of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii decreased over time by both methods. duplication rates did not differ for either  susceptible or resistant isolates of k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii. the trends in mrsa rate differed by the two methods because of the different proportion of duplicate isolates per year. mrsa rates might be increasingly overestimated for all isolates. these results suggest that the method of calculating results for the first isolate per patient may remove the effect of duplication, allowing the  simple and unambiguous analysis of cumulative susceptibility rates.

TI  == microbiology and drug resistance mechanisms of fully resistant pathogens.
AB  == the acquisition of vancomycin resistance by gram-positive bacteria and carbapenem resistance by gram-negative bacteria has rendered some hospital-acquired pathogens impossible to treat. the resistance mechanisms employed are sophisticated and very difficult to overcome. unless alternative treatment regimes are initiated soon, our inability to treat totally resistant bacteria will halt other developments in medicine. in the community, gram-positive bacteria responsible for pneumonia could become totally resistant leading to increased mortality from this common infection, which would have a more immediate impact on our current lifestyles.

TI  == monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. five university clinics and/or regional hospitals in the slovak republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (19%), staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli (13.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter sp. all cons and s. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the cons and only for 4% of s. aureus isolates. a higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in cons in comparison to s. aureus. enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against e. coli. although 17% of k. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against k. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  == background and purpose: the microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. the aim of  this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. methods: the characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at national taiwan university hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. a total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during  this period. among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. results: the majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%),  and anaerobes (3%). in decreasing frequency, escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major gram-positive pathogens. two-thirds (20/30) of s. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of e. cloacae, 13% of k. pneumoniae and 10% of e. coli. overall, 33% of e. coli and 13% of k. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. conclusions: this study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing  bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at national taiwan university hospital is different from western countries in that gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.

TI  == procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity in ventilator-associated pneumonia: impact of inadequate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == objective: to determine the homeostatic balance of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) with respect to the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy. design and setting: descriptive observational study in a 12-bed medical intensive care unit in a university-affiliated hospital. patients: twenty-nine patients with vap documented by quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar secretions and a control group of eight mechanically ventilated patients. methods: serial bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) samples were assayed for prothrombin activation fragment (f1+2), thrombin-antithrombin (tat) complex, fibrinolytic activity, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-pa), and  plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (pai-1) on days 1, 4, and 7 after vap onset. results: pathogens isolated from patients with inadequate empirical antimicrobial coverage included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n=2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=4), and acinetobacter baumannii (n=1). compared  to those who received adequate antibiotic therapy, tat, f1+2, and pai-1 levels increased while u-pa levels remained unchanged. despite antibiotic adjustment on  day 4, tat levels remained elevated in those who lacked adequate antimicrobial coverage and were significantly correlated with pao(2)/fio(2). the procoagulant activity was accompanied by a local depression of fibrinolytic capacity that was  attributed mainly to increased balf pai-1 levels. nonsurvivors showed significantly higher levels of tat and pai-1 than survivors. no significant correlation between the bacterial burden and the homeostatic derangements was documented. conclusions: the lung inflammatory response seems to promulgate a local procoagulant activity associated with hypoxemia in those with inadequate antibiotic therapy. the homeostatic derangement seems to be independent of the lung bacterial burden.

AB  == the effect of endotracheal tubes (etts) impregnated with chlorhexidine (chx) and  silver carbonate (antiseptic etts) against staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacter aerogenes [organisms associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap)], was evaluated in a laboratory airway model. antiseptic etts and control etts (unimpregnated) were inserted in culture  tubes half-filled with agar media (airway model) previously contaminated at the surface with 10(8) cfu/ml of the selected test organism. after five days of incubation, bacterial colony counts on all ett segments were determined. swabs of proximal and distal ends of the agar tract in antiseptic and control models were  subcultured. the initial and residual chx levels, (five days post-implantation in the model) were determined. cultures of antiseptic etts revealed colonization by  the tested pathogens ranging from 1-100 cfu/tube, compared with approximately 10(6) cfu/tube for the control etts (p < 0.001). subcultures from proximal and distal ends of the agar tract showed minimal or no growth in the antiseptic etts  compared with the control etts (p < 0.001). the amount of chx retained in the antiseptic etts after five days of implantation was an average of 45% of the initial level. antiseptic etts prevented bacterial colonization in the airway model and also retained significant amounts of the antiseptic. these results indicate that the effectiveness of antiseptic-impregnated etts in preventing the  growth of bacterial pathogens associated with vap may vary with different organisms.

TI  == comparative in vitro and in vivo study of nine alcohol-based handrubs.
AB  == background: hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (ahrs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 ahrs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. methods: the bactericidal activity of ahrs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter aerogenes. in a second time, ahrs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. results: the 9 ahrs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group  showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. only  1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity  against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the  care personnel. conclusion: the in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the ahrs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and  acceptance. thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of ahrs.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens isolated from a new regional hospital in southern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in taiwan. while some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be  unique for specific regions. methods: to determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from chang gung memorial hospital at chia-yi from january 2002 through december 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. results: the most common gram-positive isolate was staphylococcus aureus. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by acinetobacter baumannii. oxacillin resistance rate of s. aureus was  58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. the penicillin non-susceptibility rate of streptococcus pneumoniae was  52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. resistance to various antimicrobial agents for p. aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. infections caused by multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant a. baumannii was rarely encountered. antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid salmonella, s. choleraesuis and serogroup b isolates in particular. conclusion: the high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of bacterial ventilator-associated pneumonia in surgical intensive care units.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is the most common infection in intensive care units. it is caused by prolonged hospitalization and results in high mortality rates. this retrospective clinical study, of 140 patients in a surgical intensive care unit, aimed to identify the bacterial agents responsible for vap infection, and determine antibiotic resistance rates in vap. antibiotic sensitivity was evaluated by culturing and testing tracheal aspirates from patients with clinical and radiological findings of vap. the bacteria isolated most frequently were pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.9%), staphylococcus aureus (30.0%), acinetobacter baumannii (26.1%), and enterobacter species (4.3%). a. baumannii was more prevalent than in previous years. the results of antibiotic sensitivity testing suggested sulbactam/cefoperazone as the most appropriate drug for treating these patients. we suggest, however, that when staphylococcal pneumonia is suspected, a glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) or combined trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is used as first-line therapy until sensitivity results are obtained. in conclusion, development of antibiotic policies for individual hospitals can reduce high antibiotic resistance rates due to vap.

TI  == epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  == background: the pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (np) in infants in a pediatric surgical icu after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult icus. study objectives: the primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of np  in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. methods: data were collected between june 1999 and june 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. we retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. results: of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired np after cardiac surgery. the incidence of np was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (chd) compared to simple chd (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). the proportion of late-onset np was higher in patients with complex chd (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). a total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. gram-negative bacilli (gnb) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). the main gnb were acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen gnb were flavobacterium meningosepticum (7  isolates, 8.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). the most commonly seen gram-positive cocci were staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). the frequent fungi were candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). most gnb were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. the bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from k pneumoniae and e coli; the susceptibility of esbl-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. there were one case of methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant s epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. from 1999 to 2002 in infants with np after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant gnb such as a baumanii, p aeruginosa, and k pneumoniae. however, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. early onset episodes of np were frequently caused by haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive s aureus, and other susceptible enterobacteriaceae. conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset np, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, other multiresistant gnb, mrsa, and fungi were the predominant organisms. conclusions: the pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in np in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of gram-positive pathogens as reported by several  adult icus. gnb still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years  in our hospital. there was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia in a multi-hospital system: differences in microbiology by location.
AB  == objective: to determine whether there were differences in the microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia in different clinical settings. design: observational retrospective cohort study of microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia from 1998 to 2001 in a multi-hospital system. microbiologic results were compared between hospitals and between different intensive care units (icus) within hospitals. setting: three hospitals--one pediatric teaching hospital, one adult teaching hospital, and one community hospital--in one healthcare system in the midwestern united states. patients: patients at the target hospitals who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and for whom microbiologic data were available. results: seven hundred fifty-three episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia had culture data available for review. the most common organisms at all hospitals were staphylococcus aureus (28.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.2%). the pediatric hospital had higher proportions of escherichia coli (9.5% vs 2.3%; p < .001) and  klebsiella pneumoniae (13% vs 3.1%; p < .001) than did the adult hospitals. in the pediatric hospital, the pediatric icu had higher p aeruginosa rates than did  the neonatal icu (33.3% vs 17%; p = .01). in the adult hospitals, the surgical icu had higher acinetobacter baumannii rates (10.2% vs. 1.7%; p < .001) than did  the other icus. conclusions: microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia vary between and within hospitals. knowledge of these differences can improve selection of initial antimicrobial regimens, which may decrease mortality.

AB  == in terms of numbers of isolates, the greatest present resistance problems arise with gram-positive pathogens (which stain purple/black in gram's method), especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). but, is the mrsa problem--by its size--blinding us to something ultimately more dangerous: the slow emergence of gram-negative pathogens (which stain pink) with resistance to all reliable antibiotics? although presently rare, 'pan-resistant' gram-negative  bacteria--predominantly strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii--have more comprehensive resistance than any gram-positive pathogen. they already pose treatment problems in compromised hospital patients, especially in specialist units, as well in particular groups, such as cystic fibrosis patents. disturbingly, there is a near-total lack of developmental antibiotics active against gram-negative pathogens.

AB  == objective: to determine the incidence of acquired infection, and the incidence, risk factors, and molecular typing of multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms (mros) colonizing respiratory secretions or the oropharynx of patients in an extended-care area of the emergency department (ed) in a tertiary-care university hospital. methods: a case-control study was conducted regarding risk factors for  colonization with mros in ed patients from july 1996 to august 1998. the most prevalent mro strains were determined using plasmid and genomic analysis with pfge. results: mros colonized 59 (25.4%) of 232 ed patients and 173 controls. the mean ed length of stay for the 59 cases was 13.9 days versus 9.8 days for the 173 controls. the mean length of stay prior to the first isolation of mros was 9.9 days. mro species included acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the rate of hospital-acquired infection was 32.7 per 1,000 ed patient-days. the case fatality rate was significantly higher for cases. univariate analysis identified mechanical ventilation, nebulization, nasogastric  intubation, urinary catheterization, antibiotic therapy, and number of antibiotics as risk factors for mro colonization. multivariate regression analysis found that mechanical ventilation and nasogastric intubation independently predicted mro colonization. endemic clones were identified by pfge  in ed patients and were also found in patients in other parts of the hospital. conclusions: prolonged stay in the ed posed a risk for colonization with mros and for contracting nosocomial infections, both of which were associated with increased mortality. patients colonized with antibiotic-resistant a. baumannii may serve as a reservoir for spread in this hospital.

TI  == photodynamic effects of antioxidant substituted porphyrin photosensitizers on gram-positive and -negative bacterial.
AB  == photodynamic treatment of the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli b and acinetobacter baumannii and the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus was performed using two newly devised and synthesized antioxidant carrier photosensitizers (antioxidant carrier sensitizers-2 [acs-2] and antioxidant carrier sensitizers-3 [acs-3]), which are butyl hydroxy toluene and propyl gallate substituted haematoporphyrins, respectively. it was found that acs-2 is less reactive than other photosensitizers previously used for the same purpose, whereas acs-3 is very effective against the multidrug-resistant bacterium a. baumannii, causing its complete eradication at a low fluence (approximately 7.5 j/cm2) of blue light (407-420 nm) and a low concentration (10 microm). at a higher fluence (approximately 37.5 j/cm2) complete eradication of e. coli b can be obtained under the same conditions. furthermore, x-ray microanalysis and ultrastructural changes indicate that acs-3, especially in the case of photodynamic treatment of a. baumannii, interferes with membrane functions and causes the inactivation of the bacterium. acs-3 may be suggested as a specific photosensitization agent for photoinactivation of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of azithromycin in combination with amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin or imipenem against clinical isolates of acinobacter baumannii.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the two-drug combinations of azithromycin with amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin or imipenem against five clonally unrelated strains of acinobacter baumannii were evaluated. synergy studies were performed by the checkerboard microtiter method. the fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) index was calculated for each drug combination. none of the four combinations tested was antagonistic. the combination of azithromycin and ceftazidime was synergistic (fic index <or=0.5) for one strain and partially synergistic (fic index 0.75) for another strain. an additive effect (fic index = 1) was observed for the combinations of azithromycin with imipenem (two strains) or ceftazidime (one strain). the activities of the other combinations were indifferent (fic index range from 1.5 to 2.5). it is concluded that azithromycin combined with ceftazidime has moderate synergistic activity against some multiresistant a. baumannii.

TI  == bronchoalveolar interleukin-1 beta: a marker of bacterial burden in mechanically  ventilated patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == objective: to assess the relationship between concentrations of bronchoalveolar cytokines and bacterial burden (quantitative bacterial count) in intubated patients with a presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. design: a  cross-sectional and clinical investigation. setting medical/surgical and respiratory intensive care unit of a tertiary 1,200-bed medical center. patients: according to the time course of community-acquired pneumonia at the time of study with bronchoalveolar lavage, 69 mechanically ventilated patients were divided into three subgroups: primary (n = 11), referral (n = 23), and treated (n = 35) community-acquired pneumonia. interventions: bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the most abnormal area on chest radiograph by fiberoptic bronchoscope. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was processed for quantitative bacterial culture. the concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-10) also were measured. measurements and main results: thirty-two patients had a positive bacterial culture (bronchoalveolar lavage > or = 10 colony-forming units/ml)., and made up 76% of pathogens recovered at high concentrations. the concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta were 199.1 +/- 32.1 and 54.9 +/- 13.0 pg/ml (mean +/- se) in the patients with positive and negative bacterial culture, respectively (p < .001). bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin- 1 beta was significantly higher in the patients with a high bacterial burden (p < .001), with mixed bacterial infection (p < .001), and with  pneumonia (p < .001), compared with values in patients without these features. the relationship between bacterial load and concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta was very strong in the patients with primary and referral community-acquired pneumonia but was borderline in treated community-acquired pneumonia. conclusions: the common pathogens were similar to the core pathogens of hospital-acquired pneumonia, probably due to antibiotic effects, delayed sampling, and superimposed nosocomial infection. since the concentration of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta was correlated with bacterial burden in the alveoli, it may be a marker for progressive and ongoing inflammation in patients who have not responded to pneumonia therapy and who have persistence of bacteria in the lung.

TI  == neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in karachi.
AB  == objective: to study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. setting: the study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) at pns shifa (naval hospital), karachi during january 1997 to june 1999. methods: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth.  subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by modified kirby baur disc diffusion technique. results: a  total of 212 organisms were isolated. these included staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), escherichia coli (n = 22), enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), citrobacter diversus (n = 5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group b streptococcus (n = 2). on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for acinetobacter baumannii. resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. conclusion: in view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.

TI  == [surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: vira study].
AB  == introduction: resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. the aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. material and methods: a total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in october 2001 were studied. these included 294 methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 96 enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, 160 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 acinetobacter baumannii. sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. results: overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and mrsa strains was 24% in both cases. the pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. most mrsa isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. all the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only 50% of a. baumannii strains were susceptible  to imipenem. conclusion: the results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as mrsa, cns, ampicillin-resistant  enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.

TI  == preassembly of membrane-active peptides is an important factor in their selectivity toward target cells.
AB  == membrane-active peptides comprise a large group of toxins used in the defense and offense systems of all organisms including plants and humans. they act on diverse targets including microorganisms and mammalian cells, but the factors that determine their target cell selectivity are not yet clear. here, we tested the role of peptide length and preassembly on the ability of diastereomeric cationic  antimicrobial peptides to discriminate among bacteria, erythrocytes, and fungal cells, by using peptides with variable lengths (13, 16, and 19 amino acids long)  and their covalently linked pentameric bundles. all the bundles expressed similar potent antifungal activity (minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.2-0.3 microm) and high antimicrobial activity. hemolytic activity was also observed at concentrations higher than those required for antifungal activity. in contrast, all the monomers showed length-dependent antimicrobial activity, were less active toward bacteria and fungi, and were devoid of hemolytic activity. biacore biosensor experiments revealed a approximately 300-fold increase in peptide-membrane binding affinity between the 13- and 19-residue monomers toward  zwitterionic (egg phosphatidylcholine (pc)/egg spingomyelin (sm)/cholesterol) vesicles. all the monomeric peptides display a similar high affinity to negatively charged (e. coli phosphatidylethanolamine (pe)/egg phosphatidylglycerol (pg)) vesicles regardless of their length. in contrast, irrespective of the size of the monomeric subunit, all the bundles bind irreversibly and strongly disrupt both pc/sm/cholesterol and pe/pg membranes. attenuated total reflectance fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that peptide assembly also affects structure as observed by an increased alpha-helical and beta-sheet content in membranes and enhances acyl chain disruption of pc/cholesterol. the correlation between the antibacterial activity  and ability to depolarize the transmembrane potential of e. coli spheroplasts, as well as the ability to induce calcein release from vesicles, suggests that the bacterial membrane is their target. the data demonstrate that preassembly of cationic diastereomeric antimicrobial peptides is an essential factor in their membrane targeting.

AB  == study objective: to study the correlation of bacteriology between quantitative cultures of protected specimen brush (psb), bal, and quantitative endotracheal aspirate (qea) in ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) patients with treatment failure. design: prospective observational clinical study. setting: a 15-bed medical icu of tertiary medical center. patients: forty-eight patients receiving  mechanical ventilation with clinical suspected vap who had been treated with antibiotics for at least 72 h without improvement. intervention: qea, psb, and bal were performed with patients receiving antibiotics. the diagnostic thresholds for qea, psb, and bal were 10(5), 10(3), and 10(4) cfu/ml, respectively. measurements and results: microbial culture findings were positive in 24 bal samples (50%), in 23 psb samples (48%), and in 28 qea samples (58%). the correlations between of qea vs psb and qea vs bal were significant (rho = 0.567 and rho = 0.620, p < 0.01, respectively). the most commonly isolated microorganisms were acinetobacter baumannii (27%), staphylococcus aureus (24%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (15%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). using the predetermined criteria, bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 28 of 48 suspected vap episodes based on psb and/or bal results. the diagnostic efficiency of qea at threshold of 10(5) cfu/ml had a sensitivity of 92.8% and a specificity of 80%. conclusions: qea correlated with psb and bal in patients with suspected vap who responded poorly to the existent antibiotic treatment. qea missed only two cases  of bacterial pneumonia diagnosed by invasive psb and/or bal with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. more importantly, qea is noninvasive and easily repeatable. early use of qea is helpful to clinical physicians in decision making with regard to antibiotics use.

TI  == association between intensity of chlorhexidine use and micro-organisms of reduced susceptibility in a hospital environment.
AB  == the potential for emergence of resistance to biocides has been a concern in recent years. this study tested whether an association exists between the intensity of chlorhexidine use and chlorhexidine susceptibility of micro-organisms isolated from patients in different clinical areas in an acute-care general hospital. organisms frequently involved in nosocomial infections in the hospital were chosen for study over a six week period: staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (48), klebsiella pneumoniae (32), pseudomonas aeruginosa (60), acinetobacter baumannii  (16) and candida albicans (35). an index of chlorhexidine exposure for each clinical unit was derived for the year preceding organism collection. chlorhexidine susceptibility was evaluated using agar incorporation minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and disk diffusion. a statistically significant  inverse correlation was shown between intensity of chlorhexidine use and the overall susceptibility of all study organisms taken together. there was no association when individual taxa were considered. these findings must be interpreted with caution considering that greater use of chlorhexidine is likely  to occur in difficult clinical disciplines where antibiotic use, invasive procedures and other intensive care-related procedures, cross-infection and immunosuppression are all potential confounding factors. there was an excellent correlation between mics and disk testing, suggesting that disk diffusion might be useful in studies involving more than one biocide.

TI  == community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults: the epidemiology, timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prognostic factors.
AB  == between january 1986 and december 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital. to compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among  our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). in this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. of the pathogens, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by viridans (v.) streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. other rare organisms including acinetobacter baumannii, salmonella group b and d, proteus mirabilis, group b, d, and non-a, non-b and non-d streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. there was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with v. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with k. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. the timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates  to a glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.

AB  == objective: to determine the percentage of cross-transmissions in an intensive care unit (icu) with high nosocomial infection (ni) rates according to the data of the german nosocomial infection surveillance system. setting: a 14-bed surgical icu of a 1,300-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital. method: prospective surveillance of nis during a period of 9 months. if an ni was present, the isolates of the following indicator pathogens were stored and typed by species: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus species, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacter species. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed for typing of s. aureus strains and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction was applied for the other pathogens. the presence of two indistinguishable strains in two patients was considered as one episode of cross-transmission. results: two hundred sixty-two patients were observed during a period of 2,444 patient-days; 96 nis were identified in 59 patients and the overall incidence density of ni was 39.3 per 1,000 patient-days. for 104 isolates, it was possible to consider typing results. altogether, 36 cross-transmissions have lead to nis in other patients. that means at least 37.5% of all nis identified were due to cross-transmissions. conclusion: because of the method of this study, the percentage of nis due to cross-transmission identified  for this icu is an "at least number." in reality, the number of cross-transmissions, and thus the number of avoidable infections, may have been even higher. however, it is difficult to assess whether the percentage of nis due to cross-transmission determined for this icu may be the crucial explanation for  the relatively high infection rate in comparison to other surgical icus.

TI  == [effectiveness of contact isolation in the control of multiresistant bacteria in  an intensive care service].
AB  == aim: to describe the frequency, characteristics and progression of critically ill patients admitted to the icu, for whom isolation is indicated due to detection of multiresistant pathogenic bacteria, and to study the effectiveness of precautionary measures to avoid dissemination of these microorganisms. patients and methods: prospective, observational, cohort study performed by a specially created working group of four nurses and an icu specialist. the study included 55 patients in whom contact isolation was indicated (isolation rate, 15.2 per 100 patients), collected over a 16-month period. results: the multiresistant bacteria responsible for isolation of the patients were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), staphylococcus aureus (17 cases), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (15 cases), acinetobacter baumannii (4 cases) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- producing enterobacteria (2 cases). vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. was not identified in any case. the mean duration of icu isolation was 17.6  6 5.1 days (range 1-75). multiresistant bacteria were classified as intra-icu nosocomial in 39 cases (70.9%), extra-icu nosocomial in 10 cases (18.2%) and community-acquired in 6 (10.9%). during the study period, no epidemic outbreak due to any of the controlled bacteria was detected. the multiresistant bacteria presented in the form of colonization in 41 cases (74.5%). the reasons for discontinuing isolation were death of the patient in 18 cases, transferal to a hospital ward (discharge from the icu) in 19 cases, and eradication of the bacteria in 18 cases. of the 55 patients with multiresistant bacteria, 35 (63.6%) died during hospitalization, and 23 of these (41.8%) during their stay in the icu. conclusions: the implementation of a working team for early detection of multiresistant pathogenic bacteria resulted in application of contact isolation in 15.2% of patients admitted. surveillance to fulfill isolation precautions in a medical-surgical icu achieved an absence of epidemic outbreaks due to these bacteria during the study period.

TI  == multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in taiwan.
AB  == a susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (icus) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from march, 2000, to june, 2000, in taiwan. this study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (orsa), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), enterobacter cloacae (57%), serratia marcescens (34%), and citrobacter freundii (60%). high rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for p. aeruginosa (15%) and acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. the percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for klebsiella pneumoniae. rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (42%), enterococcus faecium (71%), and orsa (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. the resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of icus. surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in icu settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in icu patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == microbiologic aspects of predominant bacteria isolated from the burn patients in  korea.
AB  == the risk of infection in burns is well-known. in recent decades, the antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients has increased. for this reason, we have carried out a study of the predominant bacterial profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates from a burn center in  korea. a retrospective study was undertaken at hallym university, hangang sacred  heart hospital to examine the bacterial isolates from the burn patients and to compare the antibiograms of the predominant bacteria isolated from these patients with those of the other wards over a period of 3 years. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common (n=2997, 45.7%) isolate from the burn patients followed by staphylococcus aureus (n=21261, 19.2%) and acinetobacter baumannii (n=878, 13.4%). these bacteria, isolated from the burn patients, were almost all higher in antimicrobial resistance rate than those in the non-burn patients (p<0.05). because these bacteria showed very high resistant rates, they must be avoided in  order to control a hospital-acquired infection. our results seem helpful in providing useful guidelines for choosing effective empiric antimicrobial therapy  against bacteria isolated from the burn patients in korea.

AB  == of the 16,024 patients hospitalized from january 1995 to october 1997, 397 (2.4%) acquired nosocomial pneumonia and the aetiological agent was defined in 101 (25%). about 82% developed late onset pneumonia (>7 days of hospitalization). the site of isolation of microorganisms was bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) (49%), blood culture (39%), pleural effusion (10%) and (2%) pulmonary tissue. gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 54% of infections. staphylococcus aureus (34%) was  the most frequent microorganism isolated followed by acinetobacter baumannii (29%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, responsible for 7% of nosocomial pneumonia. monotherapy gave good cover for early onset pneumonia, but  not for late onset pneumonia. based on our selection criteria, ciprofloxacin was  the best monotherapy for early (50%) and late (31%) onset pneumonia. vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin gave cover of 85% of early and 64% of late onset pneumonia. monotherapy with ciprofloxacin and also combination therapy of ciprofloxacin plus vancomycin may be good options as initial empirical therapy for nosocomial pneumonia.

TI  == impact of bal in the management of pneumonia with treatment failure: positivity of bal culture under antibiotic therapy.
AB  == background: pneumonia is responsible for 50% of antibiotics prescribed in icus. treatment failure, ie, absence of improvement or clinical deterioration under antibiotic therapy, presents a dilemma to physicians. bal is an invasive method validated for etiologic diagnosis in pneumonia. study objective: to evaluate in icu patients the impact of bal in the etiologic diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of pneumonia with treatment failure. design: prospective clinical study. setting: nonsurgical, medical icu of a university hospital in brazil. patients and participants: sixty-two episodes of pneumonia treated for at least 72 h without clinical improvement in 53 patients hospitalized for diverse clinical emergencies. mean duration of hospitalization was 14.2 days. mean duration of previous antibiotic therapy was 11.4 days. interventions: bronchoscopy and bal were performed in each episode. bal fluid was cultivated for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; the cutoff considered positive was 10(4) cfu/ml; 10(3) cfu/ml was also analyzed if under treatment. pneumocystis carinii, fungi, legionella spp, and mycobacterium spp were also researched. measurements and results: fifty-eight of 62 bal were performed under antibiotics. the results showed positivity in 45 of 62 (72.6%); 42 of the 45 positive episodes (93.3%) had > 10(4) cfu/ml. the three cases with between 10(3) and 10(4) cfu/ml were considered positive and were treated according to bal cultures. the main agents were acinetobacter baumannii (37.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.7%), and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; 16.1%); 46.7% of the episodes  (21 of 45) were polymicrobial. bal results directed a change of therapy in 34 episodes (54.8%). overall mortality was 43.5%. there was no difference in mortality among positives, negatives, and patients who changed therapy guided by  bal culture. conclusions: (1) bal fluid examination was positive in 45 of 62 episodes (72.6%), with 58 of 62 bal performed under antibiotics. this suggests that bal may be a sensitive diagnostic method for treatment failures of clinically diagnosed pneumonias, even if performed under antibiotics; (2) the main pathogens in our study were a baumannii, p aeruginosa, and mrsa, and approximately 45% of infections were polymicrobial; (3) bal culture results directed a change of therapy in 75.6% of positive episodes (34 of 45) and in 54.8% of all episodes of treatment failure (34 of 62); and (4) there was no difference in mortality among positives, negatives, and patients who changed therapy guided by bal culture.

TI  == variations in etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia across four treatment sites: implications for antimicrobial prescribing practices.
AB  == this retrospective multicenter study compared microorganisms documented by quantitative cultures from bronchoscopic samples in episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) from three different institutions in barcelona (b), montevideo (m), and seville (s). the observations were compared with the findings reported by trouillet and coworkers (ajrccm 1998;157:531-539) in paris (p). the objective was to evaluate whether a classification of etiologies of vap in four groups, based on the number of ventilation days and previous antimicrobial use, might contribute to establishing generalized guidelines for empirical therapy. significant variations in etiologies (p < 0.05) were found in all of the microorganisms isolated from vap episodes across three treatment sites when compared with the reference site (p). in group 1 (< 7 d and  absence of antibiotics), pseudomonas aeruginosa remained extremely infrequent (3  of 89, 3.3%) in the joint category, whereas the incidence of acinetobacter baumannii was significantly higher, owing to m findings. on the other hand, one site (b) had a significantly lower incidence of multiresistant pathogens (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa] and nonfermenters other than  p. aeruginosa), even in group 2 (< 7 d and antibiotics), group 3 (>/= 7 d and absence of antibiotics), and group 4 (antibiotics and >/= 7 days). similar findings were documented when episodes were grouped according to groups 1 and 3 of the ats guidelines. we conclude that causes of vap varied markedly across four treatment sites, resulting in the need for large-scale variations in antimicrobial prescribing practices. instead of following general recommendations, antimicrobial prescribing practices for vap should be based on up-to-date information of the pattern of multiresistant isolates from each institution.

AB  == objective: catheter-related sepsis is an important complication associated with the use of central venous catheters. recent studies have suggested that antimicrobial-bonded catheters may reduce catheter colonization and catheter-related sepsis. the aim of this study was to determine the relationship  between the antimicrobial activity and the colonization rate of two commercially  available antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters. design: prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study. setting: medical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. patients: one hundred twenty consecutive medical intensive care unit patients requiring new central venous catheters (fresh stick). interventions: patients were randomized to receive a) a  standard arrow; b) an arrowgard; or c) a cook bio-guard spectrum central venous catheter. central venous catheters were removed when they were no longer required or when catheter-related sepsis was suspected. under aseptic conditions, the distal 12 cm of the removed catheters were cut into six 2-cm segments. semiquantitative culture was performed (by roll technique) on the distal segment. colonization was defined as >15 colony-forming units. using a modified kirby-bauer technique, the zone of inhibition of the remaining five segments was  determined against the following organisms: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, and candida albicans catheters that were removed within 24 hrs of insertion were excluded from the analysis. measurements and main results: seven patients were not assessable. the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were similar among the three groups of patients. eleven standard  arrow (28%), seven arrowgard (19%), and four bio-guard (11%) catheters were colonized (p = .05 for bio-guard vs. control). staphylococci were the most common colonizing organisms. two patients with standard arrow catheters (5%) and one patient with an arrowgard catheter (3%) developed catheter-related sepsis. antibiotic-coated catheters significantly inhibited the growth of all test organisms except c. albicans (p < or = .05). zones of inhibition were significantly larger for the bio-guard compared with the arrowgard catheter when  tested against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis (p < or = .002). conclusion: the bio-guard central venous catheter had greater ex vivo antimicrobial activity  against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis compared with the arrowgard catheter, and this was associated with a significantly lower rate of catheter colonization.

TI  == the global epidemiology of resistance to ciprofloxacin and the changing nature of antibiotic resistance: a 10 year perspective.
AB  == many studies have examined the in-vitro activity of ciprofloxacin. the results are for the most part encouraging but we must guard against complacency. levels of ciprofloxacin resistance vary geographically, while some predictably difficult-to-treat organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii present challenges globally. the emergence of  resistance in species previously exquisitely sensitive to ciprofloxacin, such as  neisseria gonorrhoeae, in countries associated with 'pirate' production and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials represents a major challenge. ciprofloxacin  continues to show excellent activity against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catharralis. in general, ciprofloxacin shows good activity against enterobacteriaceae although the emergence of reduced susceptibility and, sometimes, quinolone resistance in multi-resistant isolates should be noted.

TI  == korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of bacteria in 1997.
AB  == antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are known to be prevalent in tertiary-care hospitals in korea. twenty hospitals participated to this surveillance to determine the nationwide prevalence of resistance bacteria in 1997. seven per cent and 26% of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin. increased resistance rates, 19% of acinetobacter baumannii to ampicillin/sulbactam, and 17% of pseudomonas aeruginoa to imipenem,  were noted. the resistance rate to fluoroquinolone rose to 24% in e. coli, 56% in a. baumannii and 42% in p. aeruginosa. mean resistance rates were similar in all  hospital groups: about 17% of p. aeruginosa to imipenem, 50% of haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin, 70% of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 70% of pneumococci to penicillin. in conclusion, nosocomial pathogens and problem resistant organisms are prevalent in smaller hospitals too, indicating nosocomial spread is a significant cause of the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria  in korea.

TI  == bacteriological monitoring in the prague burns center.
AB  == the microbiological aspect of the prevention of nosocomial infections at the burn center consists primarily in the surveillance of bacterial flora and its antibiotical resistance. the prague burn center is regularly monitoring the microbial flora. patients are examined not only by the conventional methods of taking swabs of burned sites, but also by printing method, which allows a semiquantitative assessment of the colonization of burned areas. simultaneously,  investigation of bacterial contamination in the external environment of the department is carried out and the colonization of nursing staff is investigated.  in all isolated strains the sensitivity to antibiotics is examined; this is significant from the point of view of current knowledge about therapeutic possibilities and for the antibiotic policy. the typing of bacterial strains makes possible to determine their epidemiological markers, and thus to investigate their spread within the department. the most frequent isolate is s. aureus and the prevalence of mrsa is relatively high. among gramnegative rods the strains of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae are most often isolated. various typing methods revealed endemic spread of particular strains of rarely isolated species (e. agglomerans, s. marcescens, a. baumannii, etc.).

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii: an unexpected difference in epidemiologic behavior.
AB  == background: the dutch guideline on hospital policy for the prevention of nosocomial spread of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) states that patients transferred from hospitals abroad must be placed in strict isolation immediately on admission to a hospital in the netherlands. three patients colonized with both mrsa and a multiresistant acinetobacter were transferred from hospitals in mediterranean countries to 3 different hospitals in the netherlands. despite isolation precautions, acinetobacter spread in 2 of the  3 hospitals, whereas nosocomial spread of mrsa did not occur. methods: for outbreak analysis, the acinetobacter isolates, identified as acinetobacter baumannii by the use of amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, were comparatively typed by 4 methods. comparison of isolation measures in the hospitals was performed retrospectively. results: in the 2 hospitals in which nosocomial spread of acinetobacter occurred, most of the epidemiologically related isolates were indistinguishable from the index strains. in these 2 hospitals, isolation measures were in concordance with those recommended for the  prevention of contact transmission. the precautions of the hospital in which no outbreak occurred included the prevention of airborne transmission. conclusions:  precautions recommended for multiresistant gram-negative organisms are insufficient for the prevention of nosocomial spread of multiresistant acinetobacter. the airborne mode of spread of acinetobacters should be taken into account, and guidelines should be revised accordingly.

AB  == we retrospectively reviewed the variation of the organisms recovered from 403 protected bronchopulmonary specimens in three surgical intensive care units according to the time elapsed from admission. the predominant pathogens during the four first days were haemophilus influenzae (33.3%), staphylococcus aureus (18.2%), mostly methicillin susceptible strains, and streptococcus pneumoniae (14.3%). after the fourth day, they were progressively replaced by typical nosocomial bacteria such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. for pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae, strains resistant to third generation cephalosporins occurred significantly later than the susceptible strains. these results indicate that the time elapsed from intensive care unit admission has a major influence on the bacteriology of respiratory tract infections, but no clear cut-off point between early-onset and late onset pneumonia is evident.

AB  == as part of the multi-pronged strategy in the fight against burn infection, we conducted a retrospective study of the pattern of infection in our burn patients  for a period of 15 months from january 1993 to march 1994. we studied culture and sensitivity reports to determine the incidence of each organism, their antibiotic sensitivity patterns and the time interval between the burns injury and the appearance of these organisms. organisms like methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multiply-resistant acinetobacter baumannii constituted a problem in our patients. other organisms that were isolated from our patients included pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter species and klebsiella species. the infection control measures in our burns centre are aimed at combating the spread of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. this study has helped to influence our antibiotic administration policy for treating infection in our centre based on the sensitivity patterns of the prevailing flora.

AB  == to determine risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) caused by potentially drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and/or stenotrophomonas  maltophilia, 135 consecutive episodes of vap observed in a single icu over a 25-mo period were prospectively studied. for all patients, vap was diagnosed based on results of bronchoscopic protected specimen brush (> or = 10(3) cfu/ml)  and bronchoalveolar lavage (> or = 10(4) cfu/ml) specimens. seventy-seven episodes were caused by "potentially resistant" bacteria and 58 episodes were caused by "other" organisms. according to logistic regression analysis, three variables among potential factors remained significant: duration of mechanical ventilation (mv) > or = 7 d (odds ratio [or] = 6.0), prior antibiotic use (or = 13.5), and prior use of broad-spectrum drugs (third-generation cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and/or imipenem) (or = 4.1). distribution of the 245 causative bacteria was analyzed according to four groups defined by prior duration of mv (< 7 or > or = 7 d) and prior use or lack of use (within 15 d) of antibiotics. although 22 episodes of early-onset vap in patients receiving no prior antibiotics were caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, 84 episodes of late-onset vap in patients receiving prior antibiotics were mainly caused by potentially resistant bacteria. differences in the potential efficacies (ranging  from 100% to 11%) against microorganisms of 15 antimicrobial regimens were studied according to classification into these four groups. these findings may provide a more rational basis for selecting the initial therapy of patients suspected of having vap.

TI  == impact of tracheotomy on colonization and infection of lower airways in children  requiring long-term ventilation: a prospective observational cohort study.
AB  == study objectives: determination of the following: (1) colonization and infection  rates in children requiring long-term ventilation initially via a transtracheal tube and subsequently via a tracheotomy; (2) the number of infection episodes per 1,000 ventilation days, during both types of artificial airways; and (3) routes of colonization/infection of the lower airways, ie, whether the pathogenesis was  endogenous (via the oropharynx) or exogenous (via the transtracheal tube or tracheotomy). design: observational, cohort, prospective study over 2 1/2 years.  setting: pediatric icu (picu), royal liverpool children's national health service trust of alder hey, a tertiary referral center. patients: twenty-two children requiring long-term mechanical ventilation initially transtracheally and subsequently via a tracheotomy. intervention: nil. results: the lower airways were colonized in 71% of children during transtracheal ventilation; posttracheotomy, this was 95% (p=0.03). children developed significantly fewer infections following colonization with a microorganism posttracheotomy (8/15 pretracheotomy vs 6/21 posttracheotomy; p=0.013). throughout the study, there were a total of 17 episodes of infection, all of which were preceded by colonization. haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the same four causative pathogens during mechanical ventilation both transtracheally and via tracheotomy. forty-nine episodes of colonization were observed, 15 pretracheotomy and 34 posttracheotomy; of these, 12 (80%) and 19 episodes (56%), respectively, were primary endogenous, ie, present in the oropharynx on hospital admission and subsequently at tracheotomy. only one colonization episode (7%) of exogenous pathogenesis was observed during transtracheal intubation, while 12 (35%) (p=0.02) occurred after tracheotomy. an equal number of secondary endogenous colonization episodes (two and three, ie, acquired in the oropharynx after picu admission and after tracheotomy, respectively, were recorded. conclusions: (1) despite a high level of hygiene, exogenous colonization without subsequent infection was common. (2) although all patients were colonized, the infection rate was lower after tracheotomy. this may be due to enhanced immunity (medically stable) and improved tracheobronchial toilet. (3) microorganisms in children with tracheotomy differ from those in adults.

TI  == oropharyngeal or gastric colonization and nosocomial pneumonia in adult intensive care unit patients. a prospective study based on genomic dna analysis.
AB  == colonization of the digestive tract has been supposed to be the source of many hospital-acquired infections, especially nosocomial pneumonia. to assess the relationship between oropharyngeal and gastric colonization and subsequent occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia, we prospectively studied 86 ventilated, intensive care unit (icu) patients. oropharyngeal or gastric colonizations were detected and quantified on admission and twice weekly during icu stay. when nosocomial pneumonia was suspected on clinical grounds (new chest x-ray infiltrate and purulent tracheal secretions), diagnosis was assessed on fiberoptic bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures of a protected specimen brush  sampling and/or a plugged telescoping catheter sampling yielding > or = 10(3) cfu/ml of at least one microorganism. bacterial strains responsible for colonization and infection (acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, and staphylococcus aureus) were compared using pulsed-field electrophoresis. a total of 31 cases (36%) of pneumonia were diagnosed. oropharyngeal colonization, detected either on admission or from subsequent samples, was a predominant factor of nosocomial pneumonia as compared with gastric colonization. for instance, oropharyngeal colonization with a. baumannii  yielded a 7.45-fold estimated increased risk of pneumonia as compared with patients not yet or not identically colonized (p = 0.0004). dna genomic analysis  demonstrated that an identical strain was isolated from oropharyngeal or gastric  samples and bronchial samples in all but three cases of pneumonia, due to s. aureus. these findings provide better knowledge of the pathophysiology of nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients.

TI  == influence of relative humidity and suspending menstrua on survival of acinetobacter spp. on dry surfaces.
AB  == acinetobacter spp. are being reported with increasing frequency as a cause of nosocomial infection and have been isolated from the skin of healthy individuals, patients, hospital staff, dry nonbiotic objects, and different pieces of medical  equipment. factors affecting the survival of acinetobacter spp. under conditions  closely similar to those found in the hospital environment were investigated in the present study to help us understand the epidemiology of nosocomial acinetobacter infection. bacterial cells were suspended in distilled water or bovine serum albumin and were dried onto glass coverslips and kept at different relative humidities. cells washed from coverslips were used to determined viable  counts. freshly isolated strains of acinetobacter spp. belonging to the clinically important acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex  were found to be more resistant to drying conditions (e.g., 30 days for a. baumannii 16/49) than american type culture collection strains (e.g., 2 days for  a. baumannii atcc 9955). the majority of strains belonging to the acb complex had survival times similar to those observed for the gram-positive organism staphylococcus aureus tested in the experiment. survival times were prolonged for almost all the strains tested when they were suspended in bovine serum albumin (e.g., 60 days for a. baumannii r 447) compared with those for strains suspended  in distilled water (11 days for r 447). the survival times for strains at higher  relative humidity (31 or 93%) were longer than those for strains of acinetobacter kept at a relative humidity of 10% (11 days at 31% relative humidity and 4 days at 10% relative humidity for r447). these findings are consistent with the observed tendency of acinetobacter spp. to survive on dry surfaces, and they can  be transferred not only by moist vectors but also under dry conditions in a hospital environment during nosocomial infection outbreaks. the results obtained  in the experiment support the previously suggested airborne spread of acinetobacter spp. in hospital wards and repeated outbreaks after incomplete disinfection of contaminated dry surfaces.

TI  == sinusitis in mechanically ventilated patients and its role in the pathogenesis of nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  == nosocomial sinusitis is a complication of endotracheal intubation and mechanical  ventilation in critically ill patients. its incidence is often underestimated because of a lack of clinical signs. it is suspected in patients with nasal discharge or unexplained fever. its diagnosis is based on radiological examination, by radiograph or computed tomography scan, and microbiological cultures of maxillary sinus aspirate. maxillary sinusitis is often associated with involvement of the sphenoid, ethmoid, and/or frontal sinuses. its incidence  varies greatly according to diagnostic criteria and the population studied. infectious sinusitis is less frequent than noninfectious sinusitis, occurring in  20 to 30% of patients intubated for at least seven days. its incidence is higher  in nasotracheally than in orotracheally intubated patients. other risk factors include nasogastric tubes and head trauma. the main causative agents are gram-negative bacilli, primarily pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacteriaceae, but staphylococcus aureus and yeasts are also common. patients with nosocomial sinusitis are more likely to develop pneumonia than those without sinusitis. the sinus provides a bacterial reservoir from which organisms may seed the tracheobronchial tree. the association of sinusitis and pneumonia is mainly due to staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. the treatment of sinusitis is based on the removal of all nasal tubes, topical decongestants, and maxillary sinus drainage and lavage.  the role of intravenous antibiotics is controversial.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the activity of imipenem against nosocomial strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus resistant to some third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, or ciprofloxacin was assessed. these strains represent the most prevalent multi-resistant nosocomial microorganisms in chile since they were isolated from clinical specimens in 11 chilean hospitals. a high proportion of the strains were resistant to several beta-lactams, yet all strains of k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter spp. were susceptible to imipenem; resistance was exhibited by only one strain of p. aeruginosa and 16 strains of s. aureus. synergy between cefotaxime and clavulanic acid was found in almost all strains of k. pneumoniae, suggesting the presence of plasmid-coded beta-lactamases, probably with extended-spectrum activity. killing a. baumannii by imipenem was rapid, but  slower for p. aeruginosa. killing of k. pneumoniae was also somewhat slower despite the lower mic of imipenem for this strain. bactericidal activity was even slower against one strain of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. these results suggest that imipenem would be an adequate alternative to other broad-spectrum agents in the treatment of infections due to nosocomial multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activity of piperacillin-tazobactam combination on hospital isolates and regression curve].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of piperacillin (p) in combination with  4 micrograms/ml of tazobactam (t) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,245 strains isolated in 4 hospitals. in addition antibiograms by agar diffusion were  performed with disks loaded of 75 micrograms of p + 10 micrograms of t. for naturally non beta-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae (e), mic 50 and 90% of  p + t were (microgram/ml): e. coli 1-2; p. mirabilis: 0.5-1; activity was practically identical on plasmid mediated penicillinase (pase) producing strains. strains of k. pneumoniae only resistant (r) to amino- and carboxypenicillins (c)  had mics less than or equal to 4 (mode mic 2); mics of strains r to cephalothin and/or cefotaxime were 2 to 16 (mode mic 4). for chromosomal cephalosporinase (case) producing species, mics of p + t were less than or equal to 8, including for acquired pase producing strains, but were greater than or equal to 16 for case hyperproducing strains. strains of p. aeruginosa susceptible (s) to c were inhibited by 1 to 16 (with mic 4) and strains r to c by 8 to greater than 128. mics were generally 2 to 32 for a. baumannii s to c at 0.12 to greater than 128 for strains r to c. haemophilus, s or r to ampicillin, were inhibited by 0.008 to 2 (mic 50 and 90: 0.016-0.12). s. aureus s to methicillin (m), pase producing on  not, were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 (mode mic 1) and strains r to m by 8 to greater than 128. activity of p + t for coagulase-staphylococci was similar.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
