TI  == production of wheat bread without preservatives using sourdough starters.
AB  == in order for the beneficial effects of sourdough application in breadmaking to take place a proper selection of lactic acid bacteria species and strains, an appropriate technology and effective control of the purity and activity of the selected cultures. four symbiotic starters for sourdough for the production of bread were developed and probated in a production laboratory using the selected strains lactobacillus brevis lbrz7, l. buchneri lbrz6, l. plantarum x2, l. paracasei rn5, l. sanfranciscensis r and l. fermentum lbrh10 and the probiotic strain propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327. the starter sourdoughs that include propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii nbimcc 327 had greater antimicrobial activity against saprophytic microorganisms: bacillus subtilis, b. mesentericus, aspergillus niger, penicillium sp. and rhizopus sp., but none of them inhibited the growth of bakery yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae. it was established that in order to prevent bacterial spoilage 10% of the selected starter sourdoughs had to be added in the breadmaking process, while for prevention of mold spoilage the necessary amount of starter sourdough had to be between 15% and 20%.the application of the developed starters for the production of wheat bread guarantees longer shelf life and no adverse alterations in the features of the final bread.

TI  == inhibitors of biofilm formation by biofuel fermentation contaminants.
AB  == biofuel fermentation contaminants such as lactobacillus sp. may persist in production facilities by forming recalcitrant biofilms. in this study, biofilm-forming strains of lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus plantarum were isolated and characterized from a dry-grind fuel ethanol plant. a variety of potential biofilm inhibitors were tested, including microbial polysaccharides, commercial enzymes, ferric ammonium citrate, liamocins, phage endolysin, xylitol, and culture supernatants from bacillus sp. a commercial enzyme mixture (novozyme 188) and culture supernatants from bacillus subtilis strains alt3a and rpt-82412 were identified as the most promising biofilm inhibitors. in biofilm flow cells, these inhibitors reduced the density of viable biofilm cells by 0.8-0.9 log cfu/cm(2). unlike b. subtilis strain rpt-82412, b. subtilis strain alt3a and novozyme 188 did not inhibit planktonic growth of lactobacillus sp. maldi-tof mass spectra showed the production of surfactin-like molecules by both b. subtilis strains, and the coproduction of iturin-like molecules by strain rpt-82412.

TI  == spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation carried out in a novel-design stainless steel tank: influence on the dynamics of microbial populations and physical-chemical properties.
AB  == spontaneous cocoa bean fermentations carried out in a novel-design 40-kg-capacity stainless steel tank (sst) was studied in parallel to traditional brazilian methods of fermentation in wooden boxes (40-kg-capacity wooden boxes (wb1) and 600-kg-capacity wooden boxes (wb2)) using a multiphasic approach that entailed culture-dependent and -independent microbiological analyses of fermenting cocoa bean pulp samples and target metabolite analyses of both cocoa pulp and cotyledons. both microbiological approaches revealed that the dominant species of major physiological roles were the same for fermentations in sst, relative to boxes. these species consisted of saccharomyces cerevisiae and hanseniaspora sp.  in the yeast group; lactobacillus fermentum and l. plantarum in the lactic acid bacteria (lab) group; acetobacter tropicalis belonging to the acetic acid bacteria (aab) group; and bacillus subtilis in the bacillaceae family. a greater  diversity of bacteria and non-saccharomyces yeasts was observed in box fermentations. additionally, a potentially novel aab belonging to the genus asaia was isolated during fermentation in wb1. cluster analysis of the rrna genes-pcr-dgge profiles revealed a more complex picture of the box samples, indicating that bacterial and yeast ecology were fermentation-specific processes  (wooden boxes vs. sst). the profile of carbohydrate consumption and fermentation  products in the pulp and beans showed similar trends during both fermentation processes. however, the yeast-aab-mediated conversion of carbohydrates into ethanol, and subsequent conversion of ethanol into acetic acid, was achieved with greater efficiency in sst, while temperatures were generally higher during fermentation in wooden boxes. with further refinements, the sst model may be useful in designing novel bioreactors for the optimisation of cocoa fermentation  with starter cultures.

TI  == comparison of the bacterial species diversity of spontaneous cocoa bean fermentations carried out at selected farms in ivory coast and brazil.
AB  == to compare the spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation process carried out in different cocoa-producing regions, heap and box (one ivorian farm) and box (two brazilian farms) fermentations were carried out. all fermentations were studied through a multiphasic approach. in general, the temperature inside the fermenting mass increased throughout all fermentations and reached end-values of 42-48 degrees c. the main end-products of pulp carbohydrate catabolism were ethanol, lactic acid, acetic acid, and/or mannitol. in the case of the fermentations on the selected ivorian farm, the species diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acetic acid bacteria (aab) was restricted. lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides were the predominant lab species, due to their ethanol and acid tolerance and citrate consumption. the levels of mannitol, ascribed to growth of l. fermentum, were fermentation-dependent. also, enterobacterial species, such as erwinia soli and pantoea sp., were among the predominating microbiota during the early stages of both heap and box fermentations in ivory coast, which could be responsible for gluconic acid production. consumption of gluconic acid at the initial phases of the ivorian fermentations could be due to yeast growth. a wider microbial species diversity throughout the fermentation process was seen in the case of the box fermentations on the selected brazilian farms, which differed, amongst other factors, regarding pod/bean selection on these farms as compared to fermentations on the selected ivorian farm. this microbiota included lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus durianis, l. fermentum, lactobacillus mali, lactobacillus nagelii, l. pseudomesenteroides, and pediococcus acidilactici, as well as bacillus subtilis that was present at late fermentation, when the temperature inside the fermenting mass reached values higher than 50 degrees c. moreover, aab seemed to dominate the brazilian box fermentations studied, explaining higher acetic acid concentrations in the pulp and the beans. to conclude, it turned out that the species diversity and community dynamics, influenced by local operational practices, in particular pod/bean selection, impact the quality of fermented cocoa beans.

TI  == chlorine dioxide against bacteria and yeasts from the alcoholic fermentation.
AB  == the ethanol production in brazil is carried out by fed-batch or continuous process with cell recycle, in such way that bacterial contaminants are also recycled and may be troublesome due to the substrate competition. addition of sulphuric acid when inoculum cells are washed can control the bacterial growth or alternatively biocides are used. this work aimed to verify the effect of chlorine dioxide, a well-known biocide for bacterial decontamination of water and equipments, against contaminant bacteria (bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and leuconostoc mesenteroides) from alcoholic  fermentation, through the method of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), as well as its effect on the industrial yeast inoculum. lower mic was found for b. subtilis (10 ppm) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (50 ppm) than for lactobacillus fermentum (75 ppm) and lactobacillus plantarum (125 ppm). additionally, these concentrations of chlorine dioxide had similar effects on bacteria as 3 ppm of kamoran(r) (recommended dosage for fermentation tanks), exception for b. subtilis, which could not be controlled at this kamoran(r) dosage. the growth of  industrial yeasts was affected when the concentration of chlorine dioxide was higher than 50 ppm, but the effect was slightly dependent on the type of yeast strain. smooth yeast colonies (dispersed cells) seemed to be more sensitive than  wrinkled yeast colonies (clustered cells/pseudohyphal growth), both isolated from an alcohol-producing unit during the 2006/2007 sugar cane harvest. the main advantage in the usage of chlorine dioxide that it can replace antibiotics, avoiding the selection of resistant populations of microorganisms.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with spontaneous fermentations during  the production of sour cassava starch in brazil.
AB  == sour cassava starch is a traditional fermented food used in the preparation of fried foods and baked goods such as traditional cheese breads in brazil. thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of  minas gerais. the samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g(-)(1). lactobacillus perolans and lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. galactomyces geothricum and issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g(-)(1). a species similar to candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. b. cereus was found  at low numbers in product at both factories. the spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers.

TI  == effects of three microbial probiotics on postprandial porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose, galactose and amino-nitrogen in the young pig.
AB  == postprandial kinetics of porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose (g), galactose (gal), l-lactic acid (la) and amino-n (an) were studied in the piglet after the ingestion of 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu) sporolactobacillus p44 (sp), or 10(6) cfu bacillus cereus ip5832 (ac), or 10(6) cfu of a combination of  lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis (ab)/g feed. sixteen fistulated piglets (portal vein and brachiocephalic trunk; mean body weight 22 (sd 2) kg) were used. the diet was based on skimmed milk (320 g/kg), barley (300  g/kg), wheat bran (110 g/kg), maize (100 g/kg) and lactose (70 g/kg). the postprandial blood kinetics, four measurements per animal at 1-week intervals, were studied for 6 h after the ingestion of test meals of 400 g basal diet (bd) or this diet supplemented with the bacteria (sp, ac and ab respectively). areas of porto-arterial concentration differences (apacd) of g, gal and la were not influenced by the bacteria supplements. apacd of an was significantly higher after the ingestion of the sp diet than that estimated for bd.

TI  == urethanase of bacillus licheniformis sp. isolated from mouse gastrointestine.
AB  == trace levels of urethane, a cancer causing chemical, were detected in many kinds  of wine, sherry, whisky, brandy and sake. urethane formation from urea and ethanol in sake can be prevented by the treatment of acid urease, which is produced by lactobacillus fermentum, but urethane, once formed, is very difficult to decompose. in order to keep the safety of alcoholic beverages, enzymatic removal of urethane has become an urgent problem. we found that bacillus licheniformis sp., isolated from mouse gastrointestine, decomposed urethane to ethanol and ammonia. the enzyme showed higher urethanase activity at an acidic condition than at a neutral condition, and was resistant against ethyl alcohol of high concentrations. however, the enzyme had a low affinity to urethane for the industrial removal of the compound from alcoholic beverages.
