TI  == predicting fecal sources in waters with diverse pollution loads using general and molecular host-specific indicators and applying machine learning methods.
AB  == in this study we use a machine learning software (ichnaea) to generate predictive models for water samples with different concentrations of fecal contamination (point source, moderate and low). we applied several mst methods (host-specific bacteroides phages, mitochondrial dna genetic markers, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium dentium markers, and bifidobacterial host-specific qpcr), and general indicators (escherichia coli, enterococci and somatic coliphages) to evaluate the source of contamination in the samples. the results provided data to the ichnaea software, that evaluated the performance of  each method in the different scenarios and determined the source of the contamination. almost all mst methods in this study determined correctly the origin of fecal contamination at point source and in moderate concentration samples. when the dilution of the fecal pollution increased (below 3 log10 cfu e. coli/100 ml) some of these indicators (bifidobacterial host-specific qpcr, some mitochondrial markers or b. dentium marker) were not suitable because their concentrations decreased below the detection limit. using the data from source point samples, the software ichnaea produced models for waters with low levels of fecal pollution. these models included some mst methods, on the basis of their best performance, that were used to determine the source of pollution in this area. regardless the methods selected, that could vary depending on the scenario, inductive machine learning methods are a promising tool in mst studies and may represent a leap forward in solving mst cases.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.
