inhibition of efflux pumps in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis resistant strains by triterpenoids from momordica balsamina.
six cucurbitane-type triterpenoids (1-6) isolated from the aerial parts of momordica balsamina were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the activity of bacterial efflux pumps of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) col(oxa), enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, salmonella enterica subsp. i serovar typhimurium 5408 and s. typhimurium 5408cip strains. the latter strain overproduces the acrb transporter of the acrab-tolc efflux pump six-fold compared with its parent. compounds 4-6 were also tested for similar activity against escherichia coli ag100 wild-type strain and e. coli ag100tet8 that overproduces the acrab-tolc efflux pump. evaluation of efflux activity was performed using a semi-automated method that measures accumulation of the universal efflux pump substrate ethidium bromide (etbr). some of the compounds significantly inhibited efflux of etbr by mrsa col(oxa) and e. faecalis atcc 29212. a correlation between activity and the topological polar surface area of the compounds was found for mrsa col(oxa).
in vivo activity of a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, ceftaroline, against vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis strains in a rabbit endocarditis model: a comparative study with linezolid and vancomycin.
we assessed the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin ceftaroline against enterococcus faecalis in time-kill experiments and in a rabbit endocarditis model with simulated human dosing. ceftaroline was more active than either vancomycin or linezolid against vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant isolates of e. faecalis.
antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
nosocomial infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci at a university hospital in taiwan from 1991 to 2003: resistance trends, antibiotic usage and in vitro activities of newer antimicrobial agents.
a rapid increase of nosocomial methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infection (from 39% in 1991 to 75% in 2003) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) (from 1.2% in 1996 to 6.1% in 2003) at a university hospital in taiwan was found. the noticeable rise of mrsa and vre was significantly correlated with the increased consumption of glycopeptides, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (pearson's correlation coefficient, p < 0.05). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 100 non-duplicate blood isolates of mrsa (in 2003) and of 25 non-duplicate isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and 172 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (in 1996-2003) causing nosocomial infection recovered from various clinical specimens of patients treated at the hospital to nine antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. all of these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by 0.5mg/l of tigecycline, and all mrsa isolates were inhibited by daptomycin 1mg/l, including two isolates of mrsa with heteroresistance to vancomycin. daptomycin had two-fold better activity against vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis (mic90, 2 mg/l) than against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mic90, 4 mg/l). decreased susceptibilities of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and mrsa to quinupristin/dalfopristin (non-susceptibility 25% and 8%, respectively) were found. telithromycin had poor activity against the isolates tested (mic90, 8 mg/l). linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline may represent therapeutic options for infections caused by these resistant gram-positive organisms.
[inhibition of hemolytic activity of staphylococcus aureus 3-hemolysin by an exosubstance produced by some enterococcus faecalis strains].
objective: accidentally, some enterococcus faecalis strains were found to inhibit the hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. the study objectives were to define the conditions under which this phenomenon appears and to characterize the inhibitory agent. materials and methods: ninety-one wild strains and five type strains of e. faecalis and nine wild e. faecium strains were tested for antihemolytic activity on blood agar with 5% sheep erythrocytes prepared using the following agar bases: columbia agar base (bbl, 211124), columbia agar (bio merieux, 51026), blood agar base (bio-rad, 64524), blood agar base (columbia) (ferosa, 1-034), columbia blood agar base (himedia, m114), blood agar base no. 4 (imuna), columbia agar base (merck, 10455) and columbia agar base (oxoid, cm331). the exosubstance produced by e. faecalis strains was isolated by means of acetone precipitation and was exposed to elevated temperature and trypsin. results: thirty-three (36%) out of 91 wild strains of e. faecalis produced the substance inhibiting hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. two out of five e. faecalis type strains and none of e. faecium strains appeared to be producers of the same substance. inhibition of the hemolysis was observed on all of the media tested, being the most pronounced with the use of blood agar base no. 4 (imuna) and columbia agar base (bbl) at ph 7.0-7.5 when cultured at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. the exosubstance lost its inhibitory effect after exposure to 70 degrees c for 15 min and to 0.1% trypsin for 30 min. the inhibitory potential against staphylococcal hemolysis correlated with the ability of strains to produce protease. conclusion: about one third of wild e. faecalis strains produce a protease-like substance that seems proteinaceous in nature and has an inhibitory effect on the hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin.
in vitro bactericidal activities of daptomycin against staphylococcus aureus and  enterococcus faecalis are not mediated by inhibition of lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis.
previous studies have suggested that lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis inhibition is the mechanism of action of daptomycin. in this investigation, daptomycin inhibited all macromolecular synthesis in staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus hirae without kinetic or dose specificity for lipoteichoic acid. daptomycin remained bactericidal in the absence of ongoing lipoteichoic acid synthesis. inhibition of lipoteichoic acid synthesis is apparently not the mechanism of action of daptomycin in these pathogens.
inhibition of growth of staphylococcus aureus on sensitivity testing agar by streptococcus faecalis var zymogenes.

binding of beta-lactam antibiotics to penicillin-binding proteins of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis: relation to antibacterial activity.
the binding of 14 structurally diverse beta-lactam antibiotics to penicillin-binding proteins of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis was studied, and the results were examined in the context of the antibacterial activity of the compounds. penicillin-binding proteins 1 (molecular weight, 87,000) and 3 (molecular weight, 75,000) of s. aureus and penicillin-binding proteins 1 (molecular weight, 105,000) and 3 (molecular weight, 79,000) of s. faecalis bound beta-lactam antibiotics at concentrations comparable to minimum inhibitory concentrations and might therefore be essential. the low affinity of s. faecalis penicillin-binding proteins, relative to that of s. aureus penicillin-binding proteins, toward most beta-lactam antibiotics is probably responsible for the resistance of the former organism to most of these compounds.
