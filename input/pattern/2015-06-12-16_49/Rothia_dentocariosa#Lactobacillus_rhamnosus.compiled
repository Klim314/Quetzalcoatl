TI  - Microbiological profiles in saliva and supragingival plaque from caries-active adolescents before and after a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with probiotic bacteria - a pilot study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the microbial profile in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents before and after a daily short-term intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study group consisted of 18 caries-active adolescents of both sexes who volunteered for participation giving an informed consent. The study has a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind pilot design with two parallel arms. After a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were instructed to drink 2.5 dl of milk supplemented with Lactobacillus rhamnosus LB21 (107 CFU/ml) (test) or standard control milk (placebo) once daily for a period of 2 weeks (intervention period). Samples of stimulated whole saliva and supragingival plaque were collected at baseline (after run-in) and immediately after the end of the intervention period (follow-up). The salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional culturing on selective agar plates. The presence and level of 19 oral species associated with the caries process were determined using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridisation technique. Differences between the groups were assessed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests. RESULTS: The mean caries experience was high with an average of 7.0 +/- 3.8 proximal enamel lesions. The most prevalent dominating species in the plaque samples were Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus gordonii. The saliva samples displayed a more mixed profile, with Streptococcus mitis, Rothia dentocariosa, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus curvata being frequently identified species. All of the subjects harboured mutans streptococci in their saliva, with 61% of them colonised with salivary lactobacilli. No statistically significant differences in the microbial profiles or the estimated counts between the baseline and follow-up samples, or between the two study groups, were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacterium L. rhamnosus LB21 did not significantly affect the microbial profiles or the levels of caries-associated bacteria in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the microflora associated with dental caries.
AB  - Molecular techniques have revealed many novel, presumed unculturable, taxa in oral infections. The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the middle and advancing front of carious dental lesions by cultural and molecular analyses. Samples were collected with a hand excavator from five teeth with carious lesions involving dentine. Samples were cultured on blood agar and Rogosa agar incubated in air plus 5% CO(2) and on fastidious anaerobe agar anaerobically. DNA was also extracted directly from the samples and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR with universal primers. PCR products were singularized by cloning, and the cloned inserts and cultured isolates were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. We identified 95 taxa among the 496 isolates and 1,577 clones sequenced; 44 taxa were detected by the molecular method alone; 31 taxa were previously undescribed. Only three taxa, Streptococcus mutans, Rothia dentocariosa, and an unnamed Propionibacterium sp., were found in all five samples. The predominant taxa by anaerobic cultivation were the novel Propionibacterium sp. (18%), Olsenella profusa (14%), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). The predominant taxa in the molecular analysis were Streptococcus mutans (16%), Lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii (13%), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). There was no significant difference between the compositions of the microflora in the middle and advancing front samples (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon matched pairs, signed ranks test). In conclusion, combined cultural and molecular analyses have shown that a diverse bacterial community is found in dentinal caries and that numerous novel taxa are present.
