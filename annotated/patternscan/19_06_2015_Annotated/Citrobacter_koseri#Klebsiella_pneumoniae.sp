TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == supporting the ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam enterobacteriaceae breakpoint determination using humanised in vivo exposures in a thigh model.
AB  == previous in vivo studies using a human-simulated regimen of ceftaroline/avibactam 600/600mg every 8h (q8h) showed activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-, ampc- and kpc-producing enterobacteriaceae with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) </= 1 mug/ml. here we sought to determine the efficacy of this human-simulated regimen against organisms with mics >/= 1 mug/ml to help determine a breakpoint value that would reliability predict efficacy in humans. in total, 31 isolates (1 escherichia coli, 9 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 enterobacter cloacae, 1 citrobacter koseri, 2 serratia marcescens, 1 klebsiella oxytoca and 8 pseudomonas aeruginosa) with ceftaroline/avibactam mics of 1 to 16  mug/ml were tested in a murine immunocompromised thigh infection model; 15 isolates were also tested in an immunocompetent model. doses were given to simulate human free drug exposures of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h over 24h as a 1-h infusion by targeting the ft>mic profile. efficacy was evaluated as the change in log10 cfu compared with 0-h controls after 24h. reductions in bacterial cfu in the neutropenic model were seen against a majority of isolates tested with mics </= 4 mug/ml, where ft>mic was >55%. more variable efficacy was seen in isolates with mics >/= 8 mug/ml, where ft>mic drops below 40%. overall activity was enhanced in the immunocompetent model. the humanised regimen of ceftaroline fosamil/avibactam 600/600 mg q8h as a 1-h infusion showed  predictable efficacy against isolates with various genotypic and phenotypic profiles and mics </= 4 mug/ml. these data provide valuable information to help determine a ceftaroline/avibactam breakpoint for enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == evaluation of the betalacta test, a rapid test detecting resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in clinical strains of enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == for decades, third-generation cephalosporins (3gc) have been major drugs used to  treat infections due to enterobacteriaceae; growing resistance to these antibiotics makes the rapid detection of such resistance important. the betalacta test is a chromogenic test developed for detecting 3gc-resistant isolates from cultures on solid media within 15 min. a multicenter prospective study conducted  in 5 french and belgian hospitals evaluated the performance of this test on clinical isolates. based on antibiotic susceptibility testing, strains resistant  or intermediate to cefotaxime or ceftazidime were classified as 3gc resistant, and molecular characterization of this resistance was performed. the rates of 3gc resistance were 13.9% (332/2,387) globally, 9.4% in escherichia coli (132/1,403), 25.6% in klebsiella pneumoniae (84/328), 30.3% in species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamases (109/360), and 5.6% in klebsiella oxytoca and citrobacter koseri (7/124). the sensitivities and specificities of the betalacta  test were, respectively, 87.7% and 99.6% overall, 96% and 100% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, and 67.4% and 99.6% for species naturally producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. false-negative results were mainly related to 3gc-resistant strains producing ampc beta-lactamase. interestingly, the test was positive for all 3gc-resistant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates (n = 241).  the positive predictive value was 97% and remained at >/=96% for prevalences of 3gc resistance ranging between 10 and 30%. the negative predictive values were 99% for e. coli and k. pneumoniae and 89% for the species producing inducible ampc beta-lactamase. in conclusion, the betalacta test was found to be easy to use and efficient for the prediction of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, particularly in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains.

TI  == intestinal enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli populations in japanese adults demonstrated by the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr and the clone library  analyses.
AB  == a primer set specific for escherichia coli/shigella 16s rrna was developed and used for rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 35 healthy adult volunteers in combination with the previously reported primer set specific for enterobacteriaceae. enterobacteriaceae and e. coli were present in the 29 out of  35 volunteers tested as intestinal commensals at the average population levels of 10(7.1+/-0.9) and 10(6.8+/-0.7)cellsg(-1) of stools (mean+/-standard deviation),  respectively. among the 7 volunteers, the significant deviation between the count of enterobacteriaceae and that of e. coli was observed, suggesting non-e. coli/shigella species were predominant in their enterobacteriaceae populations. the clone library analysis revealed that the non-e. coli/shigella populations included citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae/variicola and morganella morganii. these data suggested that the rt-qpcr method with the primer sets specific to both enterobacteriaceae and e. coli/shigella enabled the accurate enumeration of  intestinal e. coli populations and the other enterobacteriaceae species populations.

TI  == characterization of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterobacteriaceae clinical strains and characterization of the plasmids implicated in their diffusion.
AB  == a total of 788 clinical enterobacteriaceae were collected to describe the aminoglycoside-modifying genes (ame genes) and to characterize the plasmids that  carry these genes. among the 788 strains collected, 330 (41.8%) were aminoglycoside-resistant: 264 escherichia coli (80%), 33 proteus mirabilis (10%), 10 klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), six k. oxytoca (1.8%), five enterobacter cloacae (1.5%), three morganella morganii (0.9%), three providencia stuartii (0.9%), two  salmonella enterica (0.6%), and one each citrobacter freundii, c. koseri, proteus vulgaris, and shigella sonnei. the most affected aminoglycoside was streptomycin  (92.7%), followed by kanamycin (26.3%), gentamicin (18%), tobramycin (16.9%), netilmicin (3.6%), and amikacin (1.5%). the ame genes found were aph(3'')-ib (65.4%), ant(3'')-ia (37.5%), aph(3')-ia (13.9%), aac(3)-iia (12.4%), aac(6')-ib  (4.2%), ant(2'')-ia (3.6%), and aph(3')-iia (1.2%). thirty-four percent of the strains showed more than one enzyme. the most frequent association was ant(3'')-ia plus aph(3'')-ib (35 strains). from 66 selected ame genes, 24 were plasmid located: 12 aac(3)-iia, six aph(3')-ia, three ant(3'')-ia, two ant(2'')-ia, and one aac(6')-ib. these genes were located in plasmids belonging to incompatibility groups f, fia, fib, or hi2. in conclusion, the ame genes involved in aminoglycoside-clinical resistance were aac(3)-iia, aac(6')-ib, and ant(2'')-ia, genes that confer resistance to tobramycin, gentamicin, and amikacin.

TI  == increased iga and igm responses against gut commensals in chronic depression: further evidence for increased bacterial translocation or leaky gut.
AB  == background: recently, we discovered that depression is accompanied by increased igm and iga responses directed against gram negative gut commensals. the aim of this study was to replicate these findings in a larger study group of depressed patients and to examine the associations between the iga and igm responses to gut commensals and staging of depression as well as the fatigue and somatic (f&s) symptoms of depression. methods: we measured serum concentrations of igm and iga  against the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in 112 depressed patients and 28 normal controls. the severity of f&s symptoms was measured using the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue  syndrome rating scale. results: the prevalences and median values of serum igm and iga against lps of these commensals were significantly higher in depressed patients than in controls. the igm levels directed against the lps of these commensal bacteria were significantly higher in patients with chronic depression  than in those without. the immune responses directed against lps were not associated with melancholia or recurrent depression. there was a significant correlation between the iga response directed against lps and gastro-intestinal symptoms. discussion: the results indicate that increased bacterial translocation with immune responses to the lps of commensal bacteria may play a role in the pathophysiology of depression, particularly chronic depression. bacterial translocation may a) occur secondary to systemic inflammation in depression and intensify and perpetuate the primary inflammatory response once the commensals are translocated; or b) be a primary trigger factor associated with the onset of  depression in some vulnerable individuals. the findings suggest that "translocated" gut commensal bacteria activate immune cells to elicit iga and igm responses and that this phenomenon may play a role in the pathophysiology of (chronic) depression by causing progressive amplifications of immune pathways.

TI  == diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae on hospital admission.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae have become  prevalent in both the hospital and the community. we describe the epidemiology of esbl-producing isolates and patient characteristics at hospital admission. data on clinical properties, medical history, previous hospitalizations, and previous  antibiotic treatments were collected. esbl genes (bla(ctx-m), bla(tem), and bla(shv)) were identified by polymerase chain reaction. one hundred and sixteen patients carried 122 esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae: 79 escherichia coli, 26 klebsiella pneumoniae, 16 enterobacter spp., and 1 citrobacter koseri. esbl-producing e. coli were associated with admission from home (odds ratio (or)  3.04, p = 0.02) and a history of recent urinary tract infection (or 3.38, p = 0.04), and exhibited a lower rate of antimicrobial resistance to aminoglycosides  (p </= 0.005) and co-trimoxazole (p = 0.003), whereas other esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae tended to be associated with a recent surgery (or 0.42, p = 0.057). although the ctx-m enzymes were more frequently found in e. coli (76%), they were also identified in other enterobacteriaceae (45%), suggesting penetration of ctx-m-type enzymes into both community- and hospital-acquired enterobacterial species.

TI  == molecular analysis of type 3 fimbrial genes from escherichia coli, klebsiella and citrobacter species.
AB  == background: catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states and is caused by a range of uropathogens. biofilm formation by uropathogens that cause cauti is often mediated by cell surface structures such as fimbriae. in this study, we characterised the genes encoding type 3 fimbriae from cauti strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri and citrobacter freundii. results: phylogenetic analysis of the type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcd) from 39 strains revealed they clustered into five distinct clades (a-e) ranging from one to twenty-three members. the majority of sequences grouped in clade a, which was represented by the mrk gene cluster from the genome sequenced k. pneumoniae mgh78578. the e. coli and k. pneumoniae mrkabcd gene sequences clustered together in two distinct clades, supporting previous evidence for the occurrence of inter-genera lateral gene transfer. all of the strains examined caused type 3 fimbriae mediated agglutination of tannic acid treated human erythrocytes despite sequence variation in the mrkd-encoding adhesin gene.  type 3 fimbriae deletion mutants were constructed in 13 representative strains and were used to demonstrate a direct role for type 3 fimbriae in biofilm formation. conclusions: the expression of functional type 3 fimbriae is common to many gram-negative pathogens that cause cauti and is strongly associated with biofilm growth. our data provides additional evidence for the spread of type 3 fimbrial genes by lateral gene transfer. further work is now required to substantiate the clade structure reported here by examining more strains as well  as other bacterial genera that make type 3 fimbriae and cause cauti.

TI  == chromosomally encoded blacmy-2 located on a novel sxt/r391-related integrating conjugative element in a proteus mirabilis clinical isolate.
AB  == integrating conjugative elements (ices) are mobile genetic elements that can transfer from the chromosome of a host to the chromosome of a new host through the process of excision, conjugation, and integration. although sxt/r391-related  ices, originally demonstrated in vibrio cholerae o139 isolates, have become prevalent among v. cholerae isolates in asia, the prevalence of the ices among gram-negative bacteria other than vibrio spp. remains unknown. in addition, sxt/r391-related ices carrying genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have never been described. here we carried out a genetic analysis  of a cefoxitin-resistant proteus mirabilis clinical isolate, tum4660, which revealed the presence of a novel sxt/r391-related ice, icepmijpn1. icepmijpn1 had a core genetic structure showing high similarity to that of r391 and carried xis  and int genes completely identical to those of r391, while an is10-mediated composite transposon carrying bla(cmy-2) was integrated into the ice. a nucleotide sequence identical to the 3' part of isecp1 was located upstream of the bla(cmy-2) gene, and other genes observed around bla(cmy-2) in earlier studies were also present. furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of hot spot 2 and hot spot 4 in icepmijpn1 showed high similarity to that of hot spot 2 in sxt(mo10) and with a part of the nucleotide sequence found in p. mirabilis atcc 29906, respectively. icepmijpn1 was successfully transferred to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and citrobacter koseri in conjugation experiments. these observations suggest that ices may contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes among clinically relevant enterobacteriaceae, which warrants careful observation of the prevalence of ices, including sxt/r391-related ices.

TI  == genetic structure and distribution of the colibactin genomic island among members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a genomic island encoding the biosynthesis and secretion pathway of putative hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide colibactin has been recently described in  escherichia coli. colibactin acts as a cyclomodulin and blocks the eukaryotic cell cycle. the origin and prevalence of the colibactin island among enterobacteria are unknown. we therefore screened 1,565 isolates of different genera and species related to the enterobacteriaceae by pcr for the presence of this dna element. the island was detected not only in e. coli but also in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and citrobacter koseri isolates. it was highly conserved among these species and was always associated with the yersiniabactin determinant. structural variations between individual strains were only observed in an intergenic region containing variable numbers of tandem repeats. in e. coli, the colibactin island was usually restricted to isolates of  phylogenetic group b2 and inserted at the asnw trna locus. interestingly, in k. pneumoniae, e. aerogenes, c. koseri, and three e. coli strains of phylogenetic group b1, the functional colibactin determinant was associated with a genetic element similar to the integrative and conjugative elements iceec1 and icekp1 and to several enterobacterial plasmids. different asn trna genes served as chromosomal insertion sites of the ice-associated colibactin determinant: asnu in the three e. coli strains of ecor group b1, and different asn trna loci in k. pneumoniae. the detection of the colibactin genes associated with an ice-like element in several enterobacteria provides new insights into the spread of this gene cluster and its putative mode of transfer. our results shed light on the mechanisms of genetic exchange between members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2006].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 876 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1764 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 198 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2006 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of the mepm-resistant strains were resistant to imipenem (ipm). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (41.8%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (33.3%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 4.3% (6 strains) in escherichia coli, 1.1% (1 strain) in citrobacter freundii, 21.7% (5 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 3.1% (4 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 3.3% (3 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.8% (1 strain) in serratia marcescens, and 4.9% (2 strains) in providencia spp. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 3.1% (10 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, there were no species, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 11 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == identification of type 3 fimbriae in uropathogenic escherichia coli reveals a role in biofilm formation.
AB  == catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti) is the most common nosocomial infection in the united states. uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec), the most common cause of cauti, can form biofilms on indwelling catheters. here, we identify and characterize novel factors that affect biofilm formation by upec strains that cause cauti. sixty-five cauti upec isolates were characterized for phenotypic markers of urovirulence, including agglutination and biofilm formation. one isolate, e. coli ms2027, was uniquely proficient at biofilm growth despite the absence of adhesins known to promote this phenotype. mini-tn5 mutagenesis of e. coli ms2027 identified several mutants with altered biofilm growth. mutants containing insertions in genes involved in o antigen synthesis (rmlc and manb) and capsule synthesis (kpsm) possessed enhanced biofilm phenotypes. three independent mutants deficient in biofilm growth contained an insertion in a gene locus homologous to the type 3 chaperone-usher class fimbrial genes of klebsiella pneumoniae. these type 3 fimbrial genes (mrkabcdf), which were located on a conjugative plasmid, were cloned from e. coli ms2027 and could  complement the biofilm-deficient transconjugants when reintroduced on a plasmid.  primers targeting the mrkb chaperone-encoding gene revealed its presence in cauti strains of citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca. all of these mrkb-positive strains caused type 3 fimbria-specific agglutination of tannic acid-treated red blood cells. this is the first description of type 3 fimbriae in e. coli, c. koseri, and c. freundii.  our data suggest that type 3 fimbriae may contribute to biofilm formation by different gram-negative nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == increased serum iga and igm against lps of enterobacteria in chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs): indication for the involvement of gram-negative enterobacteria in the etiology of cfs and for the presence of an increased gut-intestinal permeability.
AB  == there is now evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) is accompanied by immune disorders and by increased oxidative stress. the present study has been designed in order to examine the serum concentrations of iga and igm to lps of gram-negative enterobacteria, i.e. hafnia alvei; pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas putida, citrobacter koseri, and klebsiella pneumoniae in cfs patients, patients with partial cfs and normal controls. we found that the prevalences and median values for serum iga against the lps of enterobacteria are significantly greater in patients with cfs than in  normal volunteers and patients with partial cfs. serum iga levels were significantly correlated to the severity of illness, as measured by the fibrofatigue scale and to symptoms, such as irritable bowel, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, and failing memory. the results show that enterobacteria are involved in the etiology of cfs and that an increased gut-intestinal permeability has caused an immune response to the lps of gram-negative enterobacteria. it is suggested that all patients with cfs should be checked by means of the iga panel used in the present study and accordingly should be treated for increased gut permeability.

AB  == fishmeal extract bile salt lactose agar (febla), a new differential medium for enteric bacteria was developed and evaluated for its ability to grow and differentiate lactose fermenters (lf) from non-lactose fermenters (nlf) in comparison with macconkeys agar. performance of febla was at par with the latter. on febla medium, the contrast between lf and nlf colonies was pronounced and klebsiella pneumoniae produced more mucoid colonies than on macconkeys agar (hi media). unlike macconkeys agar, a 24 h culture of k. pneumoniae cells on febla were longer and thicker with abundant capsular material around the bacilli. escherichia coli produced long and thick cells but only after 48h. no change in cell morphology was evident with regard to salmonella typhi, s. paratyphi a, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter koseri and acinetobacter baumannii. performance of the medium was controlled using e. coli and s. flexneri. febla is simple, cost effective and may be a suitable alternative in the preliminary identification of enteric bacteria.

TI  == qnrb, another plasmid-mediated gene for quinolone resistance.
AB  == a novel plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance gene, qnrb, has been discovered in  a plasmid encoding the ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase from a klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated in south india. it has less than 40% amino acid identity with the original qnr (now qnra) gene or with the recently described qnrs but, like them,  codes for a protein belonging to the pentapeptide repeat family. strains with qnrb demonstrated low-level resistance to all quinolones tested. the gene has been cloned in an expression vector attaching a polyhistidine tag, which facilitated purification to >or=95% homogeneity. as little as 5 pm of qnrb-his6 protected purified dna gyrase against inhibition by 2 microg/ml (6 microm) ciprofloxacin. with a pcr assay qnrb has been detected in citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli isolates from the united states, linked to shv-12 beta-lactamase and coding for a product differing in five amino  acids from the indian (now qnrb1) variety. the qnrb gene has been found near orf1005 in some, but not all, plasmids and in association with open reading frames matching known chromosomal genes, suggesting that it too was acquired by plasmids from an as-yet-unknown bacterial source.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of  mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in  conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful  carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == regional variation in the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates in the asia-pacific region (sentry 1998-2002).
AB  == we examined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter koseri, and salmonella spp. that were isolated as part of  the sentry asia-pacific surveillance program between 1998 and 2002. during the study period, a total of 6,388 strains were gathered from 17 medical centers in 7 countries and examined for esbl production and hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme. high rates of confirmed esbl-producing isolates were found in k. pneumoniae strains from singapore (35.6%), followed by  those from mainland china (30.7%), south africa (28.1%), and the philippines (21.9%), whereas the rates were less than 10% in japan and australia. esbl-producing e. coli strains were also prominent in mainland china (24.5%), hong kong (14.3%), and singapore (11.3%). esbl-producing k. oxytoca were common in the philippines (38.5%), singapore (33.3%), and china (30.0%). hyperproduction of k. oxytoca chromosomal k1 beta-lactamase enzyme was common in australia and japan. p. mirabilis strains from singapore produced esbl (17.9%) despite the low  prevalence (0-8.1%) in other countries. few esbl-producing c. koseri and salmonella spp. strains were found in japan, singapore, taiwan, and south africa. although there was variation among countries in substrate preference, ceftazidime was more likely to detect presumptive esbl phenotype in k. pneumoniae and aztreonam more likely in e. coli, whereas ceftriaxone was the best substrate for  the confirmation of esbl production. esbl-producing strains showed high levels of co-resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin. imipenem retained activity against all esbl-producing strains. organisms expressing esbls are widely distributed in the asia-pacific region, although prevalence rates vary significantly.

TI  == molecular biology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae responsible for digestive tract colonization.
AB  == twenty-nine extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae  strains (14 klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 escherichia coli and five citrobacter diversus) isolated from april to july 1996 from faecal carriers in a surgical intensive care unit at the university hospital of casablanca (morocco) were studied. plasmid content and dna macrorestriction polymorphism determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) were used to compare the strains. restriction profiles of total genomic dnas cleaved by xbai and compared by pfge revealed nine, four and two clones in k. pneumoniae, e. coli and c. diversus, respectively. plasmid profile analysis of esbl-producing strains of k. pneumoniae showed that only seven of 14 isolates had a plasmid; four different plasmid profiles were observed. three different plasmid profiles were observed in e. coli and two in c. diversus. plasmids responsible for esbl production could be transferred by conjugation to e. coli k(12) j53-2 from all e. coli isolates and from four of seven k. pneumoniae. no plasmid transfer could be obtained from c. diversus strains. restriction enzyme digests of plasmids from transconjugants (four transconjugants of k. pneumoniae and five transconjugants of e. coli) showed different patterns. in the surgical intensive care unit where the survey was conducted, the dissemination of esbls was due to a mix of strain spread and strain diversity rather than to plasmid dissemination.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == shv-34: an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase encoded by an epidemic plasmid.
AB  == objectives: to elucidate the causes for treatment failure in children given extended-spectrum cephalosporins. methods: during april 1998-march 2000, 18 isolates of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, fulfilling microbiological  criteria for carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and carrying blashv, were isolated from paediatric inpatients. the collection was subjected to a retrospective molecular analysis. results: three species were represented in the collection: citrobacter koseri (one isolate), escherichia coli (one isolate)  and klebsiella pneumoniae (16 isolates). a common plasmid was found in these bacteria, as judged by restriction endonuclease digestion. this was able to transfer an esbl phenotype from donors to a laboratory strain of e. coli. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this phenotype was associated with a new variant in blashv encoding shv-34. conclusions: analysis reveals the presence of an epidemic plasmid in this collection of bacteria. this carries a gene encoding the shv-34 esbl, described for the first time in this report. nucleotide sequence analysis shows that there is a mutation from a-->g affecting the codon at amino acid position 64 (gaa-->gga), changing the glutamic acid typically seen  in this position to glycine.

TI  == indole can act as an extracellular signal to regulate biofilm formation of escherichia coli and other indole-producing bacteria.
AB  == we demonstrated previously that genetic inactivation of tryptophanase is responsible for a dramatic decrease in biofilm formation in the laboratory strain escherichia coli s17-1. in the present study, we tested whether the biochemical inhibition of tryptophanase, with the competitive inhibitor oxindolyl-l-alanine,  could affect polystyrene colonization by e. coli and other indole-producing bacteria. oxindolyl-l-alanine inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, indole production and biofilm formation by strain s17-1 grown in luria-bertani (lb) medium. supplementation with indole at physiologically relevant concentrations restores biofilm formation by strain s17-1 in the presence of oxindolyl-l-alanine and by mutant strain e. coli 3714 (s17-1 tnaa::tn5) in lb medium. oxindolyl-l-alanine also inhibits the adherence of s17-1 cells to polystyrene for a 3-h incubation time, but mutant strain 3714 cells are unaffected. at 0.5 mg/ml, oxindolyl-l-alanine exhibits inhibitory activity against biofilm formation in lb  medium and in synthetic urine for several clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, providencia stuartii, and morganella morganii but has no affect on indole-negative klebsiella pneumoniae strains. in conclusion, these data suggest that indole, produced by the action of tryptophanase, is involved in polystyrene colonization by several indole-producing bacterial species. indole may act as a signalling molecule to regulate the expression of adhesion and biofilm-promoting factors.

TI  == characterization of clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae from italy by the bd  phoenix extended-spectrum beta-lactamase detection method.
AB  == production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) is an important mechanism of beta-lactam resistance in enterobacteriaceae: identification of esbls based on phenotypic tests is the strategy most commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories. the phoenix esbl test (bd diagnostic systems, sparks, md.) is a recently developed automated system for detection of esbl-producing gram-negative bacteria. an algorithm based on phenotypic responses to a panel of cephalosporins (ceftazidime plus clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, cefotaxime plus clavulanic acid,  cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone plus clavulanic acid) was used to test 510 clinical  isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus  mirabilis, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, and citrobacter  koseri. of these isolates, 319 were identified as esbl producers, and the remaining 191 were identified as non-esbl producers based on the results of current phenotypic tests. combined use of isoelectric focusing, pcr, and/or dna sequencing demonstrated that 288 isolates possessed bla(tem-1)- and/or bla(shv-1)-derived genes, and 28 had a bla(ctx-m) gene. among the 191 non-esbl-producing isolates, 77 isolates produced an ampc-type enzyme, 110 isolates possessed tem-1, tem-2, or shv-1 beta-lactamases, and the remaining four isolates (all k. oxytoca strains) hyperproduced k1 chromosomal beta-lactamase. the phoenix esbl test system gave positive results for all the 319 esbl-producing isolates and also for two of the four k1-hyperproducing isolates of k. oxytoca. compared with the phenotypic tests and molecular analyses, the phoenix system displayed 100% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity. these findings suggest that the phoenix esbl test can be a rapid and reliable method for laboratory detection of  esbl resistance in gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == a dried investigational use-only microdilution panel named betalasen (a short named derived from the panel's purpose, to identify beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae) containing 10 beta-lactam drugs with and without beta-lactamase inhibitors was developed to identify beta-lactamases among clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter koseri, citrobacter freundii group, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. the mics obtained with a collection of 383 organisms containing well-characterized beta-lactamases were used to develop numeric codes and logic pathways for computerized analysis of results. the resultant logic pathways and betalasen panel were then used to test and identify beta-lactamases among 885 isolates of enterobacteriaceae recovered in cultures obtained at six different hospital laboratories across the united states. beta-lactamases present in 801 (90.5%) of the 885 isolates were identified by betalasen by using the existing logic pathways and codes or after minor modifications were made to the existing codes. the 84 strains that gave codes that betalasen could not identify were collected, reidentified, and retested by using betalasen. three strains had been  misidentified, 54 strains gave different codes upon repeat testing that could be  identified by betalasen, and 27 strains repeated new codes. the beta-lactamases in these strains were identified, and the new codes were added to the betalasen logic pathways. these results indicate that betalasen can identify clinically important beta-lactamases among most isolates of enterobacteriaceae. the results  also show that good quality control and attention to proper performance of the tests are essential to the correct performance of betalasen.

AB  == innate defense against microbial infection requires the action of neutrophils, which have cytoplasmic granules replete with antibiotic proteins and peptides. bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) is found in the primary granules of adult neutrophils, has a high affinity for lipopolysaccharides (or "endotoxins"), and exerts selective cytotoxic, antiendotoxic, and opsonic activity against gram-negative bacteria. we have previously reported that neutrophils derived from newborn cord blood are deficient in bpi (o. levy et al., pediatrics 104:1327-1333, 1999). the relative deficiency in bpi of newborns raised the possibility that supplementing the levels of bpi in plasma might enhance newborn antibacterial defense. here we determined the effects of addition of recombinant 21-kda n-terminal bpi fragment (rbpi(21)) on the growth and tumor  necrosis factor (tnf)-inducing activity of representative gram-negative clinical  isolates. bacteria were tested in citrated newborn cord blood or adult peripheral blood. bacterial viability was assessed by plating assay, and tnf-alpha release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. whereas adult blood limited the growth of all isolates except klebsiella pneumoniae, cord blood also allowed  logarithmic growth of escherichia coli k1/r and citrobacter koseri. bacteria varied in their susceptibility to rbpi(21)'s bactericidal action: e. coli k1/r was relatively susceptible (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)], approximately  10 nm), c. koseri was intermediate (ic(50), approximately 1,000 nm), klebsiella pneumoniae was resistant (ic(50), approximately 10,000 nm), and enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens were highly resistant (ic(50), >10,000 nm). all isolates were potent inducers of tnf-alpha activity in both adult and newborn cord blood. in contrast to its variable antibacterial activity, rbpi(21) consistently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of all strains tested (ic(50), 1 to 1,000 nm). the antibacterial effects of rbpi(21) were additive with those of a combination of conventional antibiotics typically used to treat bacteremic newborns (ampicillin and gentamicin). whereas ampicillin and gentamicin demonstrated little inhibition of bacterially induced tnf release, addition of rbpi(21) either alone or together with ampicillin and gentamicin profoundly inhibited release of this cytokine. thus, supplementing newborn cord blood with rbpi(21) potently inhibited the tnf-inducing activity of a variety of gram-negative bacterial clinical pathogens and, in some cases, enhanced bactericidal activity. these results suggest that administration of rbpi(21) may  be of clinical benefit to neonates suffering from gram-negative bacterial infection and/or endotoxemia.

TI  == the effects of plant phenolics, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid on arylamine n-acetyltransferase activities in human gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the possible effects of naturally occurring plant phenolics, caffeic acid (ca), chlorogenic acid (cga) and ferulic acid (fa) on arylamine n-acetyltransferase (nat) activities on human gastrointestinal microflora, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter koseri and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined. the bacterial nat activities were determined by hplc measuring the acetylation of 2-aminofluorene (2-af). among all examined bacteria, p. aeruginosa exerted the highest nat activity while c. koseri possessed the lowest nat activity. ca, cga and fa could suppress the bacterial nat activities dose-dependently both in the intact cell and cytosolic fraction analysis. according to the analysis of kinetic parameters in e. coli and p. aeruginosa, ca, cga and fa were shown to be potent noncompetitive inhibitors of bacterial nat activities. for the time course experiment, 4 mm of ca and fa could inhibit bacterial nat activities for at least 4 hour but 4 mm of cga could only significantly suppress nat activity in e. coli for the same reaction time. these  results strongly demonstrated that ca, cga and fa inhibited nat activities in human gastrointestinal bacteria.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == taxonomic diversity of anaerobic glycerol dissimilation in the enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a total of 1,123 strains representing 128 taxa in the enterobacteriaceae (named species or subspecies and genomic species) were screened for the presence of glycerol dehydrogenases and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. only eight taxa, citrobacter freundii sensu stricto, c. youngae, c. braakii, c. werkmanii, citrobacter genomospecies 10 and 11, enterobacter gergoviae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae could grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed  both glycerol dehydrogenase type i (induced by glycerol and dihydroxyacetone) and 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase which are typical enzymes of the anaerobic glycerol dissimilation pathway. six other species, c. koseri, e. aerogenes, e. intermedium, k. oxytoca, k. planticola and k. terrigena could not grow fermentatively on glycerol and possessed a glycerol dehydrogenase type i but no 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase. other glycerol dehydrogenases types were found: type ii (induced by glycerol and hydroxyacetone), type iii (induced by glycerol only) and type iv (induced by hydroxyacetone only). they were widely distributed  among the enterobacteriaceae. classification and identification may take advantage of tests exploring the dissimilation of glycerol.
