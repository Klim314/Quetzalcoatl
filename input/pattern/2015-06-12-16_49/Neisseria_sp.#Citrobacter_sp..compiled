TI  - Moxifloxacin (Bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  - Moxifloxacin (Bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. The MIC90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), Morexella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella sp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Clamydia pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), Listeria sp., most Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. menigitidis, Pasteurella spp., Vibrio spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica. For Mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Providencia sp., Serratia sp., P. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive Gram-negative rods, MIC90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. For anaerobic bacteria species, MIC90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. Moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the MIC and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. There is a post-antibiotic effect against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. Animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the MIC and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. Various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. Human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. A single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h, AUC of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 L/kg. Protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (M-1 and M-2). Bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. No dose modification is required in renal impairment. Extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. At present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with MICs of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. The safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.
TI  - Detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  - Fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in Norway and USA were screened for the presence of the bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA), bla(ampC), bla(cfxA), and bla(cepA/cblA) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified DNA. Thirty-four of the 53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the PCR assays. All beta-lactamase-producing Prevotella and Capnocytophaga spp. were CfxA positive. TEM-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sp., and one strain of Citrobacter freundii possessed an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. Screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. Sequence analyses showed that most CfxA positive Prevotella and Capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the CfxA2 and CfxA3 enzyme. The present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
AB  - The activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, Ro 15-8074 and Ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. Both were highly active (MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. There was no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against Morganella morganii (in the case of Ro 15-8074), Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. Staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to Ro 19-5247 (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml), but Ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. The protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for Ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for Ro 19-5247. The major target site for the two cephalosporins was PBP 3.
TI  - [In vitro activity of a new 3d-generation cephalosporin, cefodizime, on hospital  bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefodizime were evaluated by agar dilution for 746 bacterial strains isolated in two hospitals. For enterobacteriaceae MICs ranged from 0.008 micrograms/ml to more than 128 micrograms/ml (mode MIC: 0.25); mode MICs varied across species, ranging from 0.016 micrograms/ml for Proteus mirabilis to 1 microgram/ml for Citrobacter; MICs ranged from 0.12 to 8 for most Enterobacter and from 1 to 64 for Serratia. The rare cefotaxime-resistant strains, most of which were Citrobacter or Enterobacter, also showed resistance to cefodizime. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter, with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128. Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than or equal to 0.008-0.016). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant. Whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.12). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium (0.008 to 1) than for Bacteroids (8 to 128 mu g/ml). Our results show that cefodizime has the same properties as other third-generation cephalosporins: cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains also exhibit resistance to cefodizime.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. Although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher MIC values, and most Bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. The overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. Ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. The activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid pH and in urine, but serum had no effect on MICs or MBCs. Increase in ofloxacin MICs for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin: CM 40874].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of CM were evaluated on 2 548 bacterial strains isolated in 8 hospitals. CM demonstrated high activity on Enterobacteriaceae, the MIC being less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 71% of the 1 362 strains tested, less than or equal to 1 for 99.6%, and less than or equal to 4 for 99.9%. Mode MIC varies little among the different groups of Enterobacteriaceae (from 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), with the exception of Serratia sp. (mode MIC : 0.25) and Klebsiella oxytoca (mode MIC : 0.03). Most of Enterobacter, Serratia, and Citrobacter sp. strains not inhibited by cefotaxime are readily inhibited by CM at the same concentrations than susceptible strains. CM has less activity on P. aeruginosa (MIC 2-32 micrograms/ml) and Acinetobacter sp. (MIC 8-128). Staphylococci (MIC 32) and Enterococci are not susceptible. Variable activity is found against other Streptococci. CM inhibits Haemophilus sp. at MICs of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml and Gonococci at MICs of 0.03 to 0.5 (whether the strains produce beta-lactamase or not). Meningococci have a mode MIC of 0.03 micrograms/ml (range 0.008 to 0.25). Thus, CM 40874 is a new third generation cephalosporin with high activity on Enterobacteriaceae, including those strains not susceptible to cefotaxime and good activity on Haemophilus sp. and Neisseria sp. This additional activity is probably supported by enhanced resistance to enzymatic inactivation by beta-lactamases.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - The susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. Additionally, the MIC of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode MIC varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. A few Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains are resistant. Little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively). Haemophilus sp. (MIC 0.01-0.03) and Neisseria (MIC less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. The MIC of methicillin-sensitive strains of Staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; Enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other Streptococci and Pneumococci have low MICs (less than 0.008-0.025). The susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; MIC ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for Clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides sp.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
