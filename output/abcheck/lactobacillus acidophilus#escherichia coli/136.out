[evaluation of the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus probiotic culture added to yogurt over staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis populations].
the effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis was evaluated.
the three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (lactobacillus casei crl_431 and l. acidophilus crl_730 chr hansen) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr-35) culture.
about 10(9) cfu/ ml of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees c during its shelf life, about 30 days.
bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days.
results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over s. aureus, e. coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes.
the yogurt with added probiotics and l. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. s. enteritidis could not be evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation.
this study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food.
nevertheless, the use of l. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.
