TI  == routine testing for anaerobic bacteria in cerebrospinal fluid cultures improves recovery of clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == in north america, the widespread use of vaccines targeting haemophilus influenzae type b and streptococcus pneumoniae have dramatically altered the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis, while the methodology for culturing cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens has remained largely unchanged. the aims of this study were 2-fold: to document the current epidemiology of bacterial meningitis at a tertiary care medical center and to assess the clinical utility of routinely querying for anaerobes in csf cultures. to that end, we assessed csf cultures submitted over a 2-year period. a brucella blood agar (bba) plate, incubated anaerobically for 5 days, was included in the culture procedure for all csf specimens during the second year of evaluation. in the pre- and postimplementation years, 2,353 and 2,302 csf specimens were cultured, with 49 and 99 patients having positive culture results, respectively. the clinical and laboratory data for patients with positive cultures were reviewed. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in the csf samples from 33 patients post-bba compared to two patients pre-bba (p = 0.01). the anaerobic isolates included bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 1), propionibacterium species (n = 15), and propionibacterium acnes (n = 19) isolates; all of these isolates were recovered on the bba. eight of the 35 patients from whom anaerobic organisms were isolated  received antimicrobial therapy. although six of these patients had central nervous system hardware, two patients did not have a history of a neurosurgical procedure and had community-acquired anaerobic bacterial meningitis. this study demonstrates that the simple addition of an anaerobically incubated bba to the culture of csf specimens enhances the recovery of clinically significant anaerobic pathogens.

TI  == influence of different additives and their concentrations on corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effect of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to examine the ophthalmic additives responsible for modulating acute corneal epithelial toxicity induced by benzalkonium chloride (bac) and investigate the ability of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 (hco-40) and polysorbate 80 (ps-80) to reduce the corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effects of bac. methods: cytotoxicity of the additives, which included glycerin, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and ps-80, on rabbit corneal epithelial cells was examined using the cell proliferation assay in the presence and absence of 0.02% bac. the  corneal transepithelial electrical resistance change after a 60-second exposure to hco-40 or ps-80 mixed with 0.02% bac was measured in living rabbits. corneal damage was examined using scanning electron microscopy. the antimicrobial activities of hco-40 and ps-80 with 0.02% bac against staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and streptococcus pneumoniae were assessed. results: of all the tested additives, only ps-80 could prevent the bac-induced cytotoxicity. corneal epithelial barrier function disorder caused by 0.02% bac was significantly alleviated by either ps-80 or hco-40 in a concentration-dependent manner. scanning electron microscopy images showed an improvement of bac-induced corneal epithelial toxicity after the addition of hco-40 or ps-80. the antimicrobial effect of the bac against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and s. pneumoniae was reduced after adding hco-40 or ps-80.  conclusions: hco-40 and ps-80 reduce acute corneal toxicity and the antimicrobial effect of bac. possible interactions between bac and other additives should be taken into consideration when evaluating the toxicity and antibacterial properties of bac.

TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) resistance and antibiotic use in patients attending australian general practice.
AB  == background/objectives: antibiotic resistance in the community, including transfer between bacteria, is a growing concern for clinicians. acne is commonly treated in general practice, sometimes with antibiotics. the aim of this study is to measure the rate of carriage of antibiotic resistant propionibacterium acnes 10 years apart in general practice and the relationship of resistance to type of treatment, as well potential effects on other flora. methods: patients (n = 215)  with acne presenting to australian capital territory and south-eastern new south  wales general practices were swabbed for p. acnes in 1997-1998 and 2007. clinical details were collected with questionnaires. in 2007 swabs were also taken for staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. gp's diagnostic classification of acne was tested using a set of standard photographs. results: resistant p. acnes was isolated from 20 patients (9%) and the proportion that was resistant was the same in 1997-1998 and in 2007. antibiotic use, particularly topical, was associated with p. acnes resistance. resistance rates declined with  the time elapsed since ceasing antibiotics. use of retinoids was associated with  a decreased chance of growing p. acnes (p = 0.008) but not with decreased resistance. simultaneous resistance with s. aureus was not detected, but only in  30 patients was s. aureus isolated. conclusions: p. acnes resistance was similar  in 1997-1998 and in 2007.the chance of a patient carrying a resistant strain of p. acnes is significantly greater with recent exposure to antibiotics, and clinicians should limit prescribing where possible. resistance disappears rapidly after ceasing antibiotics. cross resistance with other organisms was not detected in this study.

TI  == microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast united states.
AB  == purpose: to study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in northeast united states. methods: all vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from january 1988 to december 2008 were included in the study. the distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. results: one hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons) (37.5%, n=60), viridans streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). other common gram-positive isolates include propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). the most common gram-negative isolates were klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). vancomycin was effective against all cons, sta. aureus, viridans streptococcus, and e. faecalis tested, and all sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. of all cons isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in  resistance (p=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). cons showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (p=0.010, p=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (p=0.003, p=0.040, respectively). susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. conclusion: bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. the importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == [clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in bactec9240 blood culture system].
AB  == background: continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (ttp). we evaluated the clinical relevance of ttp in the bactec9240 system (becton-dickinson, usa). methods: a total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. ttp was monitored from each of bactec plus aerobic/f (bd) or pediatric plus/f and lytic anaerobic/f bottles,  and the differential time-to-positivity (dtp) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. results: the average ttp of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. while the average ttp values for aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, acinetobacter baumannii, and streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for candida spp., anaerobes, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3  hr, respectively. the negative predictive values of ttp over 24 hr to predict staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and s. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis showed shorter ttp in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. dtp of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp. conclusions: ttp can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. the shorter ttp in anaerobic vials of certain enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. dtp is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and candida spp.

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

TI  == comparison of azithromycin and moxifloxacin against bacterial isolates causing conjunctivitis.
AB  == objective: to examine in vitro resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin in bacterial conjunctivitis isolates. methods: mic90s (minimum inhibitory concentration) and resistance rates to azithromycin and moxifloxacin were determined based upon microtiter broth dilution and/or antimicrobial gradient test strips in a multicenter phase iii study and confirmed externally. results: the most common isolates collected from bacterial conjunctivitis patients in the  phase iii study were haemophilus influenzae (40.6%), followed by staphylococcus epidermidis (19.3%), propionibacterium acnes (17.3%), streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.06%). mic90s for all of these organisms were well below established resistance breakpoints for moxifloxacin, indicating no bacterial resistance. on the other hand, the mic90 for h. influenzae was 3-fold higher than the resistance breakpoint for azithromycin, > or = 128-fold higher for s. epidermidis, 16-fold higher for s. pneumoniae and > or = 128-fold higher for s. aureus, indicating moderate to very high bacterial resistance to azithromycin. conclusions: resistance to azithromycin is more common than resistance to moxifloxacin in clinical isolates causing bacterial conjunctivitis.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

TI  == bacteriology of chronic sinusitis and acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  == objective: to establish the microbiological characteristics of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (aecs). setting: academic medical center. patients: thirty-two patients with chronic sinusitis and 30 patients with aecs. main outcome measure: the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of maxillary aecs and chronic maxillary sinusitis. results: a total of 81 isolates (33 aerobic and 48 anaerobic) were recovered from the 32 cases (2.5 per specimen) with chronic sinusitis. aerobes alone were recovered in 8 specimens (25%), anaerobes only were isolated in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 13 (41%). the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus. the predominant anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus subspecies, fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and propionibacterium acnes. twenty-one beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 17 specimens (53%). a total of 89 isolates (40 aerobic and facultatives, and 49 anaerobic) were recovered from the 30 patients (3.0 per specimen) with aecs. aerobes were recovered in 8 instances (27%), anaerobes only  in 11 (37%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 11 (37%). the predominant aerobes were streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae, and s aureus. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus subspecies, fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and p acnes. thirty-six beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 28 specimens (53%). conclusions: this study demonstrates that the organisms isolated from patients with aecs were predominantly anaerobic and were similar to those generally recovered in patients with chronic sinusitis. however, aerobic bacteria that are usually found in acute infections (eg, s pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis) can also emerge in some of the episodes of aecs.

TI  == infectious keratitis in the corneal graft: treatment with partial conjunctival flaps.
AB  == background and objective: the infection of the corneal graft is one of the most serious complications following keratoplasty. in many instances, it can be treated successfully with intensive topical and subconjunctival antibiotics. however, when this therapy is ineffective, a surgical approach must be considered. the usefulness of partial conjunctival flaps that spare the visual axis for managing corneal graft infections is reported. patients and methods: retrospective review of four cases. all patients were males between 12 and 85 years old. the four abscesses developed in the penetrating corneal graft during the first year after keratoplasty. the organisms found were propionibacterium acnes, candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae. after failure of medical therapy, they were operated on using the partial, thick  conjunctival flap technique. results: resolution of the infection and maintenance of a clear graft was achieved in all patients. the follow-up ranged from 5 to 8 years. conclusion: the partial conjunctival flap is an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of abscesses in penetrating keratoplasties when medical treatment has failed.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == [microbiology of acute exacerbation chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  == the bacterial flora taken by sinus puncture from 115 patients with uni and bilateral acute exacerbation of chronic maxillary sinusitis was analyzed. germ-free culture was obtained in 49 cases (40%) and in 69 cases (60%) bacteria were isolated from all sinus aspirates. microbiological evaluation shows, that in majority of cases (90%) of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis there were pathogenic bacteria namely aerobic and anaerobic. the most frequent pathogens isolated from the aspirates were; staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae,  escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus hominis, propionibacterium acnes i candida albicans. the culture analysis proves that one  or more pathogens can be the etiological factor. in the majority of cases (64%) the sinusitis is caused by monoculture.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in plt components.
AB  == background: a microbial detection system (bact/alert 3d, biomerieux [formerly organon teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in plts. the recovery of nine organisms seeded into plts with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. the use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis plt  units to 10 and 100 cfus per ml. replicate samples (4 ml) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. results: all organisms (with the exception of p. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 cfus/ml). in aggregate (with the exception of p. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). in all cases,  the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. p. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with  the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 cfus/ml) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 cfus/ml), respectively. the narrower bottle  neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. conclusions: these data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.

TI  == severe infective keratitis leading to hospital admission in new zealand.
AB  == aim: to identify key risk factors and the management and outcome of severe infective keratitis leading to public hospital admission in new zealand. methods: over a 2 year period, all admissions of presumed infective keratitis to auckland  hospital were identified. the clinical records of all 103 cases were retrospectively reviewed with respect to clinical features, risk factors, management, and outcomes. results: the mean time from first symptoms or signs and presentation to hospital was 8.9 (sd 15.5) days. the majority of subjects, 88%, had at least one of the risk factors commonly associated with infective keratitis including previous ocular surgery (30%), contact lens wear (26%), topical corticosteroid use (25%), and ocular trauma (24%). corneal scraping was performed in 92% and of a total of 105 scrapes, 71% were positive. bacteria were isolated in all these cases, the majority being gram positive organisms (72%). the most common isolates identified were coagulase negative staphylococcus (16%), propionibacterium acnes (14%), staphylococcus epidermidis (11%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (9%). in addition, yeasts were isolated in 5%, fungi in  4%, virus in 2%, and chlamydia in 1%. importantly, polymicrobial infection accounted for 33% of culture positive cases. antimicrobial treatment was changed  on the basis of culture results in 17 cases (16.5%). median initial visual and final best corrected visual acuity was 6/36-6/48 (logmar 0.86) (iqr 0.39-2.00) and 6/12-6/15 (logmar 0.360) (iqr 0.15-1.70), respectively. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use were significantly associated with poorer  visual acuity. the mean hospital stay was 5.8 days and the median 4.0 (iqr 2.0-8.0) days. longer duration of stay was associated with the presence of hypopyon, larger ulcers, previous ocular surgery, and poor visual acuity. conclusions: infectious keratitis is an important cause of ocular morbidity. a significant proportion of cases have potentially modifiable risk factors. previous ocular surgery and topical corticosteroid use, in particular, were associated with poorer visual outcomes. many cases of severe keratitis might be avoided, or their severity reduced, by appropriate education of patients and ophthalmologists.

TI  == increased antimicrobial resistance in organisms recovered from otitis media with  effusion.
AB  == previous studies concerning the microbiology of otitis media with effusion (ome)  did not correlate the past use of antimicrobial agents with the recovered organism's antimicrobial susceptibility. a retrospective analysis of cultures obtained from aspirates of 129 children with ome was performed. the study identified the isolated organisms and determined their susceptibility to the most recently administered antimicrobials. bacterial growth was noted in 58 (45 per cent) patients. aerobic organisms only were recovered in 37 aspirates (63 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in seven (12 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (24 per cent). a total of 92 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.6 isolates per specimen (1.1 aerobes and 0.5 anaerobes). there were a total of 66 aerobic isolates, including haemophilus influenzae non type-b (20 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (17), and staphylococcus spp. (seven). twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. (eight each) and propionibacterium acnes (four). resistance to the antimicrobial used was found in 60 (65 per cent) isolates, recovered from 41 (71 per cent) of the patients. of the 41 patients in whom resistance was detected, 37 (90 per cent) had been treated within three months of culture and four (10 per cent) had completed treatment more than three months before the cultures were taken (p < 0.01). the highest rate of recovery of resistant organisms was following trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (96 per cent), amoxycillin (71 per cent), and azithromycin (56 per cent). of the patients treated with amoxycillin, h influenzae predominated. s pneumoniae was recovered from four of the seven (57 per cent) after trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, four of 14 (29 per cent) following amoxycillin, and three of 11 (27 per cent) after azithromycin. the data illustrate the relationship between resistance to the antimicrobials given to children and their recovery from the middle ear of patients with ome.

TI  == vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  == objective: to investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. methods: a prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between september 2001 and may 2002 at the cullen eye institute. aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients  after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. results: mean +/- sd gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/ml, 1.34  +/- 0.34 micro g/ml, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/ml respectively. mean +/- sd sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. the percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration  achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous mic(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. conclusions: orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low mic(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin  represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of t-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of t-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone, was compared with that of nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin and gentamicin. the in vitro activity of t-3912 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, ofloxacin-resistant  s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and propionibacterium acnes was four-fold to 16 000-fold greater than that of other agents at the mic90 for the clinical isolates. the activity of t-3912 was not influenced by grla mutation in s. aureus, and the degree of mic increase of t-3912 for grla-gyra double and triple mutants was lowest among the quinolones tested (nadifloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). the inhibitory activity of t-3912 was compared with other quinolones for dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv of  s. aureus sa113. t-3912 showed the greatest inhibitory activity for both enzymes  among the quinolones tested. the isolation frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to t-3912 was < 1.7 x 10(-9) and < 2.0 x 10(-9) for s. aureus sa113 and p. acnes jcm 6425, respectively. furthermore, resistance to t-3912 could not be clearly detected in the 28th transfer by the serial passage method. t-3912 exhibited more potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus and p. acnes than nadifloxacin and clindamycin in a short time period. t-3912 in a 1% gel formulation showed good therapeutic activity against a burn infection model caused by s. aureus sa113, p. acnes jcm6425 and multidrug-resistant s. aureus f-2161. these results indicate that t-3912 is potentially a useful quinolone for  the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections and that its potent bactericidal activity might be able to shorten the treatment period.

TI  == [mechanisms behind the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria].
AB  == background: bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an increasing threat to the successful treatment of hospital and community-acquired infections. material and  methods: based on relevant literature, this article focuses on some of the essential resistance problems caused by pathogens such as pneumococci, staphylocci, enterococci and gram-negative rods, and provides a review of the genetic and molecular basis of bacterial resistance, as well as of the global trends in bacterial resistance. results: mechanisms of resistance continue to evolve and disseminate among gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. new problems are developing, such as glycopeptide resistance in staphylococcus aureus. bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics as a result of chromosomal  changes or the exchange of genetic material via plasmids and transposons. the emergence of multiresistant bacteria e.g. s. aureus, enterococci and mycobacterium tuberculosis, has made many currently available antibiotics ineffective. interpretation: the introduction of new antibiotics has always been  followed by development of resistance.

TI  == microbiology of serous otitis media in children: correlation with age and length  of effusion.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to correlate the microbiology of serous otitis media in children with the duration of the condition and the patient's age. aspirates of serous ear fluids from 114 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was noted in 47 patients (41%). aerobic organisms only were recovered in 27 aspirates (57% of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria only in 7 (15%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 13 (28%). a total of 83 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.2 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). there were a total  of 57 aerobic isolates, including haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus sp (12). twenty-six anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (10), prevotella spp (8), and propionibacterium acnes (4). the rate of positive cultures (20 of 36; 56%) was higher in patients younger than 2 years of age than in those older than 2 years of age (27 of 78; 35%). streptococcus pneumoniae and h influenzae were more often isolated in children younger than 2 years of age and those with effusion for 3 to 5 months, whereas anaerobes were recovered more often in those older than 2 years of age and those with effusion for 6 to 13 months. these data illustrate the effects of the length of effusion and age on the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in serous otitis media.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == the hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. the gene was isolated on an ecori-generated 3-kb piece of dna. expression was less in escherichia coli than in p. acnes; in e. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. the gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kda. amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. the leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. the amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from  streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus. a  potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == clinical bacteriology of dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  == to better define the spectrum and relative incidence of pathogens causing dacryocystitis in adults, samples of purulent lacrimal sac contents were obtained from 236 patients undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy for a clinical diagnosis of dacryocystitis. positive culture results were obtained in 52.5%. cultures were pure, consisting of a single organism in 71%, and were mixed in 29%. gram-positive organisms were most common, accounting for 64.5% of the isolates. staphylococcus epidermidis, comprising 27.3% of the isolates and staphylococcus aureus, comprising 22.1% of the isolates, were the most frequently encountered organisms. gram-negative organisms were present in 27.3% of the isolates with pseudomonas aeruginosa the most common, accounting for 8.7% overall. anaerobic organisms were found in 7.0% of the isolates with propionibacterium acnes the most frequent, recovered in 4.7% overall. unexpected findings included the paucity of streptococcus pneumoniae organisms recovered and the high incidence of involvement by gram-negative and anaerobic organisms.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  == latex agglutination test: an adjunct to the laboratory diagnosis of pyogenic bacterial meningitis.
AB  == gram stain, culture and latex agglutination test (lat) of cerebrospinal fluid were performed in 50 patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from pyogenic bacterial meningitis. using all the three techniques, an aetiological diagnosis was made in 27 (54%). neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and h. influenzae were the infecting organisms in 21 cases (44%). there were 12 additional cases in which lat was the only clue to the diagnosis as compared to conventional techniques. propionibacterium acnes was isolated from one case of anaerobic meningitis. it is concluded that lat is an adjunct to conventional techniques in the diagnosis of pyogenic bacterial meningitis, where the latter tests fail.

TI  == activity of mersacidin, a novel peptide, compared with that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin.
AB  == mersacidin, a new peptide antibiotic, was four- to eightfold less active (mic for 90% of isolates, 8 micrograms/ml) than vancomycin, teicoplanin, or daptomycin against staphylococcus aureus. coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml, and the mics of mersacidin for hemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. the mersacidin mics for anaerobic organisms were as follows: clostridium perfringens, 4 micrograms/ml; propionibacterium acnes, 8 micrograms/ml; peptococci, 1 microgram/ml; and peptostreptococci, 8 micrograms/ml. mersacidin had no activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, neisseria and haemophilus species, or pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the size of the inoculum, the ph of the assay (5.5 to 7.5), the type  of medium, and the anaerobic conditions had minimal effects on the mics and mbcs  of mersacidin. overall, mersacidin proved less active than available glycopeptides and peptolides.

TI  == in-vitro studies with ramoplanin (mdl 62,198): a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial.
AB  == ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of actinoplanes sp. (atcc 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl  moieties and d-mannose. the in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. ramoplanin was very active against staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. ramoplanin was also very active against streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, str. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spp. (including cory. jeikeium), listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, propionibacterium acnes and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. in general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. with the  exception of bacteroides melaninogenicus and bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == comparison of the nasal bacterial floras in two groups of healthy subjects and in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the nasal bacterial flora was studied in 183 healthy men entering military service (entry group), 103 healthy recruits in service (service group), and 185 recruits with acute maxillary sinusitis. the 267 nasal and ipsilateral sinus aspirate findings in the same patients with acute maxillary sinusitis were compared pairwise. in the entry group presumed sinus pathogens were only rarely isolated from the nasal cavities: haemophilus influenzae in 4%, streptococcus pneumoniae in 1%, branhamella catarrhalis in 3%, and streptococcus pyogenes in 0%. the corresponding isolation frequencies in the service group were 19, 13, 3,  and less than 1%, respectively, and those in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis were 61, 25, 7, and 6%, respectively. suppression of the major components of the normal nasal flora, corynebacterium sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus, was seen in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis and also occasionally in the service group. when a sinus aspirate culture yielded a presumed sinus pathogen, the same  pathogen was found in the nasal samples in 91% of the cases. the predictive value of a pathogen-positive nasal finding was highest (93.8%) for s. pyogenes, followed by 77.7% for h. influenzae and 68.7% for s. pneumoniae, and lowest (20%) for b. catarrhalis.

TI  == bacteriological findings of acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults.
AB  == bacteriological findings in 339 sinus secretions obtained by puncture were investigated in 238 young adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. aerobic  and anaerobic cultures were performed immediately. a total of 76% of the secretions were positive. the most common pathogens isolated were haemophilus influenzae (50%), streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), streptococcus pyogenes (5%), and branhamella catarrhalis (2%). coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 8 and 1% of the specimens, respectively. the staphylococci were almost invariably present in low numbers and, therefore, probably represented nasal contamination. other aerobic species were found only occasionally. anaerobes were isolated in 5% of the secretions. in one-half of these, a low concentration of propionibacterium acnes was the sole anaerobe that  was found, and it was usually mixed with a facultative organism (suggestive of contamination with nasal flora). only 2% of the sinuses were considered to have true anaerobic infections (high concentrations of several species typical of anaerobic infection), indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis in a young adult population. the high recovery of h. influenzae in this study indicates that aminopenicillins may be more appropriate  choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis (only 2 of 168 h. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase).

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a-56268 (te-031), a new macrolide.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of a-56268 (te-031), the 6-o-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. a-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. a-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and propionibacterium acnes, for which a-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. the mbc of a-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the mic against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and h. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the mics for some staphylococcus aureus strains. human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of a-56268 or erythromycin. a-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being  more active at ph 8.0 than at the physiologic ph of 7.3. the activity of a-56268  was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of h. influenzae. in mouse protection tests, when administered orally a-56268 was more potent than  erythromycin against h. influenzae, s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus. after subcutaneous administration the potencies of a-56268 and erythromycin were  not statistically different from each other. a-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against legionella infection in guinea pigs. the concentration of a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in a-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than  that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. in mice, the peak levels in serum of a-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for a-56268 after oral administration. the  serum half-life of a-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.

TI  == the quantity and function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages after splenectomy and corynebacterium parvum.
AB  == we have previously shown that corynebacterium parvum (c. parvum), a nonspecific immunomodulator, partially protects splenectomized and nonsplenectomized mice when challenged with aerosolized pneumococci. we report here the effects of both  splenectomy and c. parvum on the phagocytic function of the lavageable pulmonary  alveolar macrophage (pam). groups of young adult male sprague dawley rats underwent splenectomy or sham operation 3 weeks before injection of c. parvum 1.5 mg ip (or saline) per animal. one week postinjection pam's were harvested. the in vitro phagocytic indices (pi) for pam incubated with tritiated thymidine-labeled  s. aureus or streptococcus pneumoniae, type 14, opsonized with normal rat serum,  were determined. splenectomy had no effect on lung weights, pam yield, or pam phagocytic activity. c. parvum administration significantly increased spleen weight in sham-operated animals, but had no effect on lung weights, pam yield, or phagocytic activity of either control or splenectomized animals. splenectomy in the adult rat did not induce a phagocytic defect in the pam and thus the lavageable pam cannot be considered a significant site of the postsplenectomy defect. since c. parvum protects animals from respiratory challenge with streptococcus pneumoniae but does not alter the number or activity of lavageable  alveolar macrophages, we hypothesize that c. parvum protection is more likely related to our previous finding of an increased clearance of blood-borne bacteria by the expanded and enhanced reticuloendothelial system.

TI  == the effect of the immunomodulator corynebacterium parvum on hemisplenectomized mice.
AB  == the immunomodulator corynebacterium parvum stimulates the reticuloendothelial system and causes splenic hypertrophy. the ability of c parvum to stimulate splenic regeneration in hemisplenectomized mice and decrease susceptibility to intranasal pneumococcal challenge was studied. mice were divided into two groups, control sham-operated (n = 48) and hemisplenectomized (n = 47) animals. ten days  later, each group was divided into two subgroups, those injected with c parvum (700 mcg ivp) and those injected with an equivalent volume of saline. the animals were challenged with streptococcus pneumoniae, which was injected into one nostril three weeks postoperatively, and mortality was assessed. four and one-half weeks postoperatively, splenic tissue was removed, measured, weighed, and submitted for histologic examination. the number of spleen cells per gram of  tissue was assessed. treatment with c parvum resulted in a significant increase in the splenic weight in both hemisplenectomized and control animals compared to  similar saline-injected mice (p less than 0.001). the percentage increase in spleen weight of hemisplenectomized mice (106%) was significantly greater than that for control animals (56%; p less than 0.01). there was no significant difference among experimental groups in the number of spleen cells per gram of splenic tissue or in the histologic characteristics, indicating that c parvum stimulated relatively normal splenic growth. survival following pneumococcal challenge was significantly increased for hemisplenectomized mice by c parvum treatment to a level that did not significantly differ from control mice. this study demonstrates that in mice the deficits related to resistance to infection and spleen size following hemisplenectomy are significantly improved by treatment with c parvum.

TI  == bacteriological study in chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == the bacterial findings of 73 maxillary sinuses in 48 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis, together with 7 non-inflamed sinuses, are reported. employing an intraoperative technique and simultaneous collection of 3 different  types of specimens in the present investigation made possible comparison of their bacterial characteristics. the results indicated that intraoperative culture of antral mucosa seems to provide the most reliable finding of bacterial flora in chronic maxillary sinusitis. the anaerobic bacteria were never found in the mucosal culture of non-inflamed sinus. the anaerobes appeared to invade the sinus cavity following the sealing of the ostium through the lymphatic or venous system and maintain the inflammatory process. microbiological analysis of the results between the infected and non-inflamed sinuses established anaerobic bacteria as the most important pathogen in chronic maxillary sinusitis. the predominant anaerobes recovered in descending order of frequency were veillonella sp., peptococcus sp., propionibacterium acne and anaerobic nonspore-forming gpb. statistical analysis of the results of mucosal culture of inflamed and control materials demonstrated that those aerobic and faculatative bacteria recovered in  the inflamed sinus appeared to be the normal inhabitants of non-inflamed sinus mucosa. the presence of normal flora in the normal healthy sinus mucosa may explain the chain of events that follows the occlusion of the ostium. these aerobic bacteria may become pathogenic and play a role in the pathogenesis of sinusitis.

TI  == improved survival after pneumococcus in splenectomized and nonsplenectomized mice with corynebacterium parvum.
AB  == splenectomy increases the susceptibility to infections with certain bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae. because the immunomodulator corynebacterium parvum expands the phagocytic cell compartment and enhances reticuloendothelial function, we tested the effect of c parvum in mice challenged with aerosolized pneumococci. mice splenectomized seven days before pneumococcal  challenge and treated intraperitoneally with 700 micrograms of c parvum immediately after exposure were protected when compared with splenectomized or sham-operated saline-injected controls. analysis of proportional hazards showed the risk of dying in order of greatest to least as follows: splenectomy/saline, sham/saline, splenectomy/c parvum and sham/c parvum. the benefits of an intact spleen and c parvum seemed to be additive in their protective effects after aerosol pneumococcal challenge. after intravenous challenge, bloodstream clearance was improved in sham-operated mice at three days after c parvum injection compared with saline-injected sham-operated controls and c parvum-injected splenectomized mice. a significant improvement in bacterial clearance did not occur until seven days after c parvum treatment in splenectomized mice. the results demonstrate the value of a nonspecific immunomodulator for enhancing the defense mechanisms of both normal and splenectomized animals.

TI  == microbiology of otitis media.
AB  == the microbiology of otitis media (om) has been documented by cultures of middle ear fluid (mef) obtained by needle aspiration. the results of studies of bacteriology of om from sweden, finland and the united states are very similar: streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae are the most important pathogens: gram-negative enteric bacilli are isolated from mef of approximately equal to 20% of infants to six weeks of age but are rarely present in mef of older children; group a beta hemolytic streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus are infrequent causes of otitis. preliminary results suggest that anaerobic bacteria are responsible for some episodes of om. although epidemiologic data suggest that virus infection is associated with om, the results of ten studies indicate that these agents are infrequently isolated from mef of children with om. viruses were isolated from 29 to 663 patients (4.4%). respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus were isolated most frequently. the results of seven studies of mycoplasma infection in 771 patients with om included only one isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from mef. these results indicate that viruses  and mycoplasmas are uncommonly found in mef of patients with om, but few studies  have been attempted in recent years. chlamydia trachomatosis is the etiologic agent of a mild but prolonged pneumonia in infants. om may accompany the respiratory infection, and c. trachomatis has been isolated from mef of some of these infants. recent studies of asymptomatic children with persistent mef indicate that bacterial pathogens are present in some of these fluids. investigators in columbus, boston, and pittsburgh obtained mef for culture at the time of myringotomy or placement of tympanostomy tubes. bacteria were isolated from mef of 50% of these children; s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or group a streptococcus were isolated from 10% to 20% of cases. there were only minimal differences in the rates of isolation of bacteria from serous, mucoid, or purulent fluids. the significance of these results is uncertain, but they suggest that the persistent effusion may be a result of asymptomatic but prolonged infection or may be an immune response to a persisting antigen.

TI  == biphasic protection against bacterial infection in mice induced by vaccination of propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the protection showed a biphasic pattern. the maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with p. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. the activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4  and 12. the delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. the early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin d, or cyclophosphamide. the number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. the number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. total activities of acid phosphatase, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of p. acnes vaccine.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of acute otitis media in children.
AB  == tympanocentesis and aerobic and anaerobic cultivation of the middle-ear fluid obtained was performed through one or both tympanic membranes of 62 children with acute otitis media. aerobic bacteria alone, predominantely pneumococcus and hemophilus influenzae, were isolated from 57% of patients; anaerobic organisms alone, most commonly propionibacterium acnes and peptococcus, from 15%. thirteen  percent yielded mixtures of aerobes and anaerobes, and several had multiple aerobic or anaerobic agents. the isolation of only anaerobic bacteria, supported  in some patients by gram-stain observations of middle-ear fluid, suggest that these bacteria, especially petococcus, may occasionally play a direct role in acute otitis media.

TI  == [growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
