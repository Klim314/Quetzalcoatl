TI  == periodontal disease in a remote asian population: association between clinical and microbiological parameters.
AB  == objective: the aim was to clinically and microbiologically describe the periodontal conditions in a remote adult asian population with poor oral hygiene. methods: the subjects were 30-60-year-old adults of karen hill tribes with no access to dental care. eighty-six subjects were selected randomly. clinical registrations included number of remaining teeth, plaque index (pli), bleeding on probing (bop), clinical attachment loss (cal), and probing pocket depth (ppd). subgingival plaque samples were collected and analyzed with the checkerboard method. results: subjects of the study group had mean number of remaining teeth of 26.5 despite the abundant plaque and a high bleeding score. severe periodontitis (cal >/= 7 mm) was recorded in 12.9% of the youngest age group (30-39 years) while it was significantly higher (52%) in the middle group (40-49  years) and (60%) in the eldest age group (50-60 years). pathological pocketing (ppd >/= 7 mm) was significantly lower in all age groups. age, betel chewing, and a microbiological cluster including at least one of prevotella tannerae, filifactor alocis and porphyromonas endodontalis significantly correlated with the severity of periodontal disease. conclusion: age, betel chewing, and a new bacterial complex other than the "red complex" correlated to periodontal breakdown in this remote adult asian population.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == a new checkerboard panel for testing bacterial markers in periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aims: various microbiological methods have been used for testing bacterial markers for periodontitis and periodontal disease progression. most studies have used only a limited number of well recognized bacterial species. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association of 13 more recently  identified bacterial species in a new panel in comparison with 12 previously more recognized periodontotopathogens ('old panel') using the 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization method. methods: fifty individuals were chosen who showed at least  one site with a probing pocket depth of 6 mm or more (disease) and bleeding on probing and at least one site with a probing pocket depth of 3 mm and without bleeding on probing (health). one diseased and one healthy site on each individual were sampled with the paperpoint technique and the samples were processed in the checkerboard technique against deoxigenin-labeled whole genomic  probes to 25 subgingival species representing 12 well recognized and 13 newly identified periodontitis associated species. results: twenty-four (out of 25) species were detected more frequently in the subgingival plaque of diseased than  healthy sites both at score 1 (> 10(4)) and score 3 (> 10(5)). a significant difference at the higher score (score 3) was noticed for all species of the old panel except for three (streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, and eikenella corrodens). of the species in the new panel only prevotella tannerae, filifactor alocis, and porphyromonas endodontalis showed a statistical significant difference between diseased and healthy sites. conclusion: it was concluded that p. tannerae, f. alocis, and p. endodontalis should be added to the 12 species used for routine diagnostics of periodontitis-associated bacterial flora.
