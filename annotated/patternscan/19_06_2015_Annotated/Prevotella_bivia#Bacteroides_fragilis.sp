TI  == antimicrobial resistance among anaerobes isolated from clinical specimens in kuwait hospitals: comparative analysis of 11-year data.
AB  == our objective was to compare the antimicrobial resistance trends among clinically relevant anaerobes against 9 different antibiotics over two periods, 2008-2012 and 2002-2007. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by determining  the mics using e test method. the interpretation of results was according to the  breakpoints recommended by the clinical laboratory and standard institute (clsi)  and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast). a total  of 2240 clinically significant isolates were collected between 2008 and 2012 in four teaching hospitals in kuwait. the commonest isolates were bacteroides fragilis (40.4%), prevotella bivia (18.6%), peptostreptococcus spp. (13.8%) and bacteroides ovatus (11.1%). according to clsi and eucast breakpoints used for the 2008-2012 and 2002-2007 isolates, high resistance rates to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, penicillin and piperacillin were noted among the gram-negative isolates. they ranged between 0 and 0-62.1 and 62.1%, and 0 and 0-59.1 and 62.1%, respectively against clindamycin, 0 and 0-34.5 and 45.3%, and 0 and 0-45 and 57.5%, respectively against piperacillin and 0 and 0-24.2 and 24.2%, and 0 and 0-23.1 and 30.6%, respectively against amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. the mean interpretative results by both clsi and eucast during the 2008-2012 and 2002-2007 periods showed that the b. fragilis isolates were highly resistant to penicillin  (100 vs 100%), clindamycin (43.7 vs 44.2%), piperacillin (35.8 vs 42.7%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (13.2 vs 14%), respectively. when compared with 2002-2007, the clsi, but not eucast, demonstrated statistically significant decreased resistance to clindamycin (p < 0.03). however, both interpretative criteria showed demonstrable statistically significant decrease in resistance rates to imipenem (p < 0.00097 vs p < 0.00074), meropenem (p < 0.000006 vs p < 0.0407) and piperacillin (p < 0.000017 vs p < 0.0461). our data shows that there  is a need for periodic monitoring of the susceptibility testing for anaerobic bacteria in the face of increasing resistance rates as well as to guide in the empirical therapy of anaerobic infections.

TI  == ceftaroline plus avibactam demonstrates bactericidal activity against pathogenic  anaerobic bacteria in a one-compartment in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  model.
AB  == anaerobic pathogens are often associated with polymicrobial infections, such as diabetic foot infections. patients with these infections are often treated with broad-spectrum, multidrug therapies targeting resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, as well as gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. the broad-spectrum, non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam has been combined with ceftaroline and may provide a single-product alternative for complicated polymicrobial infections. we compared  the activity of ceftaroline-avibactam (cpa) to that of ertapenem (ert) against common anaerobic pathogens in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) model. simulations of doses of ceftaroline-fosamil at 600 mg every 8 h (q8h) (maximum free drug concentration [fcmax], 17.04 mg/liter, and half-life [t1/2], 2.66 h) plus avibactam at 600 mg q8h (fcmax, 11.72 mg/liter, and t1/2, 1.8 h) and of ertapenem at 1 g q24h (fcmax, 13 mg/liter, and t1/2, 4 h) were evaluated against two strains of bacteroides fragilis, one strain of prevotella bivia, and  one strain of finegoldia magna in an anaerobic one-compartment in vitro pk/pd model over 72 h with a starting inoculum of approximately 8 log10 cfu/ml. bactericidal activity was defined as a reduction of >/=3 log10 cfu/ml from the starting inoculum. both cpa and ert were bactericidal against all four strains. cpa demonstrated improved activity against bacteroides strains compared to that of ert but had similar activity against finegoldia magna and p. bivia, although modest regrowth was observed with cpa against p. bivia. no resistance emerged from any of the models. the pharmacokinetics achieved were 92 to 105% of the targets. cpa has potent in vitro activity against common anaerobic pathogens at clinically relevant drug exposures and may be a suitable single product for the management of complicated polymicrobial infections.

TI  == anti-anaerobic activity of serum from patients treated with tigecycline for skin/soft tissue infections.
AB  == to gain additional data concerning the anti-anaerobic activity of tigecycline in  serum, we analyzed blood samples from six patients with a complicated skin/soft tissue infection who were receiving iv tigecycline 50 mg every 12 h. venous blood samples were obtained after multiple doses of tigecycline at 1, 6 and 12 h after  the initiation of a 1 h iv infusion. sera from these samples were tested to determine serum inhibitory and bactericidal activity over time against 4 anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, prevotella bivia and finegoldia magna). an analysis of serum titers found that tigecycline exhibited early (1 h) and prolonged (12 h) inhibitory activity against each study isolate. moreover, it provided bactericidal activity for 12 h  against these strains with the exception of f. magna. tigecycline was found to exhibit antibacterial activity at serum concentrations below the mics of the anaerobic bacteria tested. this finding further supports that the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline can be greater than that suggested by the free fraction of drug and that serum appears to enhance this antibacterial activity.

TI  == amniotic fluid interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6, but not interleukin-8 correlate with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in preterm labor.
AB  == problem: we compared the frequency of intra-amniotic infection in preterm labor (pl) with women not in labor, and correlated infection with amniotic fluid (af) cytokines. detailed identification of species, especially mycoplasmata, was tried to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of pl. method of study: af from  20 women with pl and 20 controls were evaluated. infection was detected by pcr for mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and 16s rrna bacterial gene, which was cloned and sequenced for bacterial identification. interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8 and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha levels were measured by elisa. results: frequency of intra-amniotic infection is higher in pl (40.0%). sequencing-based method identified bacteroides fragilis, prevotella bivia and leptotrichia amnionii, in addition to mycoplasma species detected by pcr. af infection correlated with increased il-1beta and il-6 levels. conclusion: the frequency of intra-amniotic infection, especially m. hominis, in pl women who delivered with 7 days, is high and correlates with high il-1beta and il-6 levels, but not il-8.

TI  == in vitro inhibitory activity of human vaginal lactobacilli against pathogenic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis in kenyan women.
AB  == lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of many pathogens and have been used as probiotics to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and/or vaginal disorders. we sought to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of lactobacilli of vaginal origin to some bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), to characterize the inhibitory substances produced by these lactobacilli and to assess h2o2 production. vaginal specimens were obtained by swabbing the lateral vaginal walls from 107 women two months following bv treatment. one hundred and fifty eight lactobacillus spp. were isolated in 82 of  the 107 women. lactobacillus jensenii was the predominant strain isolated among these women (29/158; 18.4%). among 158 culture supernatants tested for antibacterial activity against bv-associated bacteria, none inhibited the growth  of bacteroides fragilis while 23% (37/158), 28% (45/158) and 29% (46/158) inhibited the growth of prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. respectively. the lactobacilli produced supernatants with a ph range between 2.62 and 6.71; the highly acidic (ph 2-3.99) supernatants were more inhibitory to the indicator strains. there was significant reduction in the mean zones of inhibition following chemical and physical treatment of the supernatants (p = 0.0025). acid, bacteriocins and h2o2 demonstrated potential for antagonism of the bacterial pathogens. these substances may augment each other rather that each working independently on the pathogens.

TI  == surveillance and trends of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates of anaerobes in kuwait hospitals from 2002 to 2007.
AB  == the susceptibility trends for all anaerobes processed by the anaerobe reference laboratory against various antibiotics were determined by using data for 2557 isolates referred by all government hospitals in kuwait from 2002 to 2007. mic were determined for the following anti-anaerobic antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, imipenem, meropenem, metronidazole, penicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin (for gram-positive anaerobes only), using e-test method. the commonest isolates were bacteroides fragilis (36.8%), followed by peptostreptococcus spp. (21.9%), bacteroides ovatus (15.5%) and prevotella bivia (12.1%). in addition, prevotella  oralis and other bacteroides spp. represented 8.5% and 8.1% of total number of isolates, respectively. resistance rate varied among the antimicrobial agents and the species tested. the beta-lactams, with the exception of penicillin, were the  most active drugs. piperacillin-tazobactam was the only antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were uniformly susceptible. imipenem and metronidazole were highly active with resistance rate of only <5% recorded against most isolates. however, 42.8, 55.8 and 9.3% of clostridium difficile isolates were resistant to imipenem, clindamycin and meropenem, respectively. it is noteworthy  that from 2002 to 2007, there was a gradual increase in resistance rates to clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin among b. fragilis. periodic surveillance of antibiotic resistance among the anaerobic bacteria is recommended as a guide to empiric antibiotic use and formulation of guideline for appropriate choice of antimicrobial therapy in anaerobic infections.

TI  == moxifloxacin resistance is prevalent among bacteroides and prevotella species in  greece.
AB  == objectives: moxifloxacin is recommended in the empirical treatment of infections  involving gram-negative anaerobes. however, current european data regarding its activity against anaerobic pathogens are limited. in order to evaluate its potency, we comparatively studied the activity of moxifloxacin against recently isolated gram-negative anaerobes. methods: four hundred and ninety-five gram-negative anaerobic clinical isolates (296 bacteroides fragilis group, 58 non-fragilis bacteroides spp. and 141 prevotella spp.) were prospectively recovered in six greek hospitals. moxifloxacin mics were determined in comparison with those of penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoxitin, imipenem, metronidazole and clindamycin. results: overall moxifloxacin mic(50) and mic(90)  were 2 and 32 mg/l, respectively. based on the current clsi breakpoints (susceptible, < or =2 mg/l; resistant, > or =8 mg/l), almost half of the total isolates (49%) were non-susceptible to moxifloxacin (32% resistant; 17% intermediate). this was more evident among the non-fragilis bacteroides species,  where 47% of the isolates were resistant and 14% intermediate to moxifloxacin. species variation was noticed, with the highest non-susceptible rates detected among prevotella oralis (90%), prevotella bivia (80%), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (75%), bacteroides uniformis (70%) and bacteroides capillosus (67%) species. among the 19 (4%) isolates that were metronidazole non-susceptible (mic > or = 16 mg/l), only 4 (21%) were additionally non-susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusions: high resistance rates to moxifloxacin among bacteroides and prevotella spp. were recorded, exceeding those previously reported in europe and contraindicating its use as monotherapy for infections involving gram-negative anaerobes without prior microbiological confirmation. for empirical usage, moxifloxacin should be combined with metronidazole in order to cover for these pathogens.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == we studied the serum bactericidal activity (sba) of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against common pathogens associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections.  ten healthy volunteers received a single dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg) and levofloxacin (750 mg) and serum samples were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24h after the dose of each drug. bactericidal titers in serum over time were determined for aerobic gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebseilla pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae) and anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella bivia, and finegoldia magna).  both fluoroquinolones provided rapid (2h) attainment and prolonged (24h) sba (titers > or = 1:8) against each of the aerobic bacilli studied. sba was observed for at least 12h against b. fragilis strains with mics < or = 2 microg/ml to moxifloxacin and < or = 4 microg/ml to levofloxacin. prolonged (12h) sba (titers  > or = 1:2) was also observed against isolates of b. thetaiotaomicron, p. bivia,  and f. magna with moxifloxacin < or = mics 2 microg/ml.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ph-027 versus linezolid and other anti-anaerobic antimicrobials against clinical isolates of clostridium difficile and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == ph-027 is a new 5-triazole oxazolidinone synthesized in our laboratories, which shows strong activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including clinical isolates. the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro activity of this compound in comparison with linezolid and other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. the in vitro activity of ph-027 in comparison with those of linezolid and other antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 201 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by agar dilution and etest methods. ph-027 showed excellent activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) in the range of 0.12-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates; mic90s being 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against clostridium difficile, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, prevotella  bivia and fusobacterium spp. respectively. in comparison, linezolid had mic in the range of 0.5-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates, with mic90s of 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against the same set of bacteria respectively. ph-027  demonstrated excellent in vitro activity that is superior to linezolid against peptostreptococcus spp., b. fragilis and p. bivia. however, against c. difficile  and fusobacterium spp, ph-027 and linezolid showed comparable in vitro activity.  against all anaerobes, metronidazole, ph-027 and, to a lesser extent, linezolid had the most potent activity. from the results of in vitro susceptibility testing, both linezolid and ph-027 show promise in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, s-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  == carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. s-4661, a new injectable carbapenem  antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase i. we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-4661 against strains of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. the mic(50) and  mic(90) of s-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/l, respectively. the in vivo efficacy of s-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by e. coli and b. fragilis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the s-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. these results suggest that s-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.

TI  == septic arthiritis due to prevotella bivia in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == prevotella bivia is a gram-negative anaerobic bacteria traditionally classified in the genus bacteroides, and usually reported in obstetric and gynecologic infections. to date, there has been only one description of infectious arthritis  secondary to this germ. we report the first case of septic arthritis due to prevotella bivia in a patient with severe, long-lasting rheumatoid arthritis (ra) treated with low doses of corticosteroids. ra is a well-known predisposing factor to septic arthritis, whose causes are multifactorial (general immunosuppression induced by the disease and its therapy, presence of prosthetic joints, etc.). however, infectious arthritis due to anaerobic bacteria is rarely observed. in general, clinical presentation varies widely: insidious onset, apyrexia, and lack of inflammatory signs or systemic disturbance are frequent features. joint infection is generally secondary to hematogenous spread, the bacteroides fragilis group being the most commonly isolated pathogens. early diagnosis and prompt treatment, with drainage and debridement of the affected joint and specific antimicrobial treatment with metronidazole are essential for a successful outcome.

TI  == synergic activity, for anaerobes, of trovafloxacin with clindamycin or metronidazole: chequerboard and time-kill methods.
AB  == chequerboard titrations were used to test the activity of trovafloxacin, alone and in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole, against 156 gram-positive or gram-negative anaerobes, including 47 bacteroides fragilis group, 36 prevotella spp., 26 fusobacteria, 21 peptostreptococci and 26 clostridia. mic50/mic90 values (mg/l) of each drug alone against all 156 strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.5/1; clindamycin, 0.25/2; metronidazole, 1/2. synergy (fic indices </= 0.5) was seen in two strains with trovafloxacin plus clindamycin, and seven with trovafloxacin plus metronidazole. all other combinations were additive (fic indices >0. 5-2.0); no antagonism (fic indices >4.0) was seen. in addition,  synergy was tested by time-kill methodology for each of the above combinations against 12 gram-positive or gram-negative strains. results indicated that synergy (defined as a >/= 2 log(10) decrease in cfu/ml at 48 h compared with the more active drug alone) was found between trovafloxacin at or below the mic and both clindamycin and metronidazole at or below the mic in one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium varium, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and clostridium bifermentans. synergy between trovafloxacin (</=mic) and metronidazole alone was  seen in one strain each of bacteroides distasonis, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium mortiferum, p. asaccharolyticus and c. bifermentans. in many cases  of synergy, including those at the trovafloxacin mic, regrowth after 48 h, which  was commonly seen with trovafloxacin alone, was inhibited, and 99.9% killing was  observed with the combination after 48 h, but not with trovafloxacin alone.

TI  == in vitro activity of r-95867, the active metabolite of a new oral carbapenem, cs-834, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of r-95867, the active metabolite of a new oral carbapenem, cs-834, was compared with those of du-6859a, cefditoren, ampicillin/sulbactam and clindamycin against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. r-95867 inhibited 90% of anaerobic strains at </=2 mg/l. in general, r-95867 was 2- to 4-fold less active  than du-6859a but more active than other agents tested against strains of peptostreptococci, clostridia, the bacteroides fragilis group, porphyromonas spp. and fusobacteria. r-95867 was stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase type 2e derived from b. fragilis, prevotella bivia and prevotella intermedia, but unstable to hydrolysis by carbapenemase from b. fragilis.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == prevalence of nim genes in anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated in south africa.
AB  == this study investigated the prevalence of nim genes (proposed to encode a 5-nitroimidazole resistance product) in 64 anaerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria. employing universal nim gene primers, 458-bp amplified fragments were recorded as presumptive positives in 22/64 strains at an annealing temperature of 52 degrees c and 15/64 strains at 62 degrees c, of which seven were propionibacteria. dna sequencing confirmed the presence of nima genes in propionibacterium spp. (five strains), actinomyces odontolyticus (one strain), prevotella bivia (one strain) and clostridium bifermentans (one strain) and nimb  genes from five strains of bacteroides fragilis. nima genes were predominant in propionibacteria indicating a potential nima gene source in anaerobic environments.

TI  == elastase activity of anaerobes isolated from amniotic fluid with preterm premature rupture of membranes.
AB  == objective: a total of 131 anaerobes isolated from amniotic fluid with preterm premature rupture of membranes and stored were examined for elastolytic activity  by the method described by williams et al (lett appl microbiol 1988;7:173-6). study design: each strain was spot inoculated on a columbia blood agar plate containing 1% solubilized elastin and incubated for 5 days under anaerobic conditions. undigested elastin was precipitated by flooding trichloroacetic acid  solution onto the plate, and a clear zone was visible as the elastolytic reaction around the spot of bacterial growth. results: ninety-three (71.0%) of 131 organisms showed a positive elastolytic reaction. eleven of 20 strains (55.0%) of peptostreptococcus magnus, 9 of 18 strains (50.0%) of peptostreptococcus micros,  12 of 12 strains (100.0%) of fusobacterium nucleatum, 15 of 28 strains (53.6%) of bacteroides fragilis, 8 of 15 strains (53.3%) of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and 38 of 38 strains (100.0%) of prevotella bivia were elastolytic. conclusion: anaerobic bacterial species prevalent in the normal vaginal flora that were isolated from amniotic fluid of women with preterm rupture of membranes produced  elastolytic activity, plausibly inducing the destruction of host constitutive components.

TI  == studies on the pathogenicity of anaerobes, especially prevotella bivia, in a rat  pyometra model.
AB  == objective: prevotella bivia is one of the anaerobic bacteria that resides in the  flora of the female genital tract. we studied the pathogenicity of p. bivia in a  rat pyometra model. methods: the experimental animal (rat) model of pyometra was  developed to investigate the pathogenicity of p. bivia in a rat pyometra model. results: in the groups inoculated with aerobes alone, the infection rate was 10%  (1/10) in the staphylococcus aureus- or staphylococcus agalactiae-inoculated group and 20% (2/10) in the escherichia coli-inoculated group. infection was not  established in the groups inoculated with anaerobes alone. high infection rates were observed in all the mixed-infection groups. in the s. agalactiae- and bacteroides fragilis-, s. agalactiae- and p. bivia-, f. coli- and b. fragilis-, and e. coli- and p. bivia-inoculated groups, an infection rate of 100% (10/10) was demonstrated. the efficacy of antibiotics such as flomoxef (fmox) could be determined using a rat pyometra model. in relation to the alteration of vaginal microbial flora during the menstrual cycle, estrogen increased the growth of p. bivia. conclusion: mixture of aerobic bacteria and p. bivia increased the pathogenicity of p. bivia. estrogen would be useful for raising up the inflammatory change of the uterus in experimental models of genital tract infection due to p. bivia.

TI  == characterization of saccharolytic bacteroides and prevotella isolates from infected dog and cat bite wounds in humans.
AB  == saccharolytic, nonpigmented, anaerobic gram-negative rods isolated from infected  dog and cat bite wounds in humans have been poorly characterized, and most are not included in the databases of kits used for anaerobic identification; thus, they are problematic for clinical laboratories to identify. fifty strains isolated from such wounds were characterized with commercial kits for preformed-enzyme detection, carbohydrate fermentation, and other biochemical tests. pcr fingerprinting was performed on these strains to further characterize  subgroups within these species. bacteroides tectum is a frequent isolate in bite  wounds and resembles prevotella bivia in colony morphology and saccharolytic activity, except that it grows in 20% bile and hydrolyzes esculin. profile numbers generated by various kits associate b. tectum with p. bivia, prevotella oralis group, or prevotella melaninogenica. pcr fingerprinting identified at least four subgroups and confirmed the heterogeneous nature of this species. prevotella heparinolytica was also frequently isolated from these bite wounds. it produces indole and generates a profile number in preformed-enzyme kits that is usually associated with bacteroides uniformis. however, it is bile sensitive and  quite distinct from the bacteroides fragilis group of anaerobes. the pcr fingerprint profiles generated by strains of p. heparinolytica were very similar  to that of the type strain and to each other. prevotella zoogleoformans, occasionally isolated from dog and cat bite wounds in humans, resembles p. heparinolytica except for a negative indole test. clinical laboratories should be aware of the characteristics of these animal species when identifying isolates from animal bite wounds in humans.

AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == identification and strain differentiation of 'bacteroides fragilis group' species and prevotella bivia by pcr fingerprinting.
AB  == using single consensus primers of genomic nucleotide sequences, pcr-generated fingerprints were used for identification and differentiation of the bacteroides  fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. ovatus, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus) and prevotella bivia (b. bivius) by comparing the dna profiles with those of reference strains from the american type culture collection and german culture collection. when primed by a single primer phage m13 core sequence, intra-species specific differences and species-specific bands were detected. using primers derived from the evolutionarily conserved trna gene sequence, species-specific patterns were produced. a computer program, gelmanager, was used to analyze the profiles and generate dendrograms. the correlation coefficients determined from the dna fingerprint profiles of the clinical isolates (using the  m13 core primer) fell within a narrow range, reflecting a high level of homology  within the species. based on the dendrograms, strains of one species were clearly differentiated from strains of other species. for comparison, sds-page analysis of whole cell extracts was also performed to obtain protein band patterns of various strains. because of the simplicity of the pcr fingerprinting method and the ease of performance of computerized evaluation of data, this technique is a useful method for both species and strain differentiation, as well as for characterization of bacteroides species and prevotella bivia.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ici 194660, cas 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. they included bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), prevotella bivia (n = 11), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated  species and genera, e.g. selenomonas sputigena and clostridium symbiosum. bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, clostridium species, including c. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all  the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. meropenem was especially active against bacteroides gracilis (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), prevotella disiens (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml), fusobacterium nucleatum (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml), clostridium perfringens (mic90 0.015 microgram/ml) and veillonella parvula (mic90 0.03 microgram/ml). the results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == patterns of susceptibility to fluoroquinolones among anaerobic bacterial isolates in the united states.
AB  == the activity of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria has generally been moderate to poor. nalidixic acid and cinoxacin show poor activity  against almost all anaerobes. norfloxacin and enoxacin exhibit poor anaerobic activity (mic90, 8- > 256 micrograms/ml) except against clostridium perfringens,  bacteroides ureolyticus, and some eubacteria. norfloxacin is slightly more active than enoxacin against some bacteroides species. while ciprofloxacin is more active than earlier fluoroquinolones against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis (mic90, 4-16 micrograms/ml), fusobacteria, and peptostreptococci, its activity is often variable and its mic90 is frequently close to the maximal level attainable in serum. ofloxacin is active against b. fragilis (mic90, 4-8 micrograms/ml) but not against other species of the b. fragilis group (mic90, 8-32 micrograms/ml); other anaerobes (e.g., peptostreptococci and fusobacteria) are generally susceptible to < or = 8 micrograms of ofloxacin/ml. several newer quinolones exhibit improved anaerobic activity (although the studies yielding relevant data have often used diverse methods, small numbers and varieties of isolates, and different breakpoints). ci-960 and win 57273 inhibit 95% of strains tested at < or = 2 micrograms/ml. ci-990, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin inhibit  most anaerobes at < or = 2 micrograms/ml, but clustering around the breakpoint and strain variability have been noted. ci-990 is active against more than 85% of b. fragilis strains (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), but other species of the b. fragilis group often require > 4 micrograms/ml for inhibition; prevotella bivia,  fusobacterium varium, and fusobacterium ulcerans are usually resistant.(abstract  truncated at 250 words)

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
