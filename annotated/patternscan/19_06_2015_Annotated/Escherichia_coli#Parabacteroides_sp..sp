TI  == isolation of bacteria from mouse caecal samples and description of bacteroides sartorii sp. nov.
AB  == caecal samples from wild-type and tnf(deltaare) mice were cultured on selective media containing bile salts, amino acids or casein macro-peptides. twenty-two strains were isolated and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. twenty-one strains showed >98% similarity to known bacteria (blautia spp., clostridium innocuum, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus murinus, parabacteroides goldsteinii and shigella dysenteriae). one additional isolate, strain a-c2-0, was a new bacterium. the closest relatives were bacteroides massiliensis, bacteroides dorei and bacteroides vulgatus (< or = 94% similarity). strain a-c2-0 is a gram-negative rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 41.5%. its major cellular fatty acid is c(15:0 anteiso), and its major respiratory quinone is mk-9. cells are aerotolerant but grow only under strict anoxic conditions. they are resistant to cefotaxime and tobramycin. when compared with related bacteroides spp., the new bacterium was positive for alpha-arabinosidase, negative for glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and did not  metabolise galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, raffinose and sucrose. strain a-c2-0 therefore merits recognition as a member of a novel species within the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides sartorii is proposed. the type  strain is a-c2-0(t) (= dsm 21941(t) = ccug 57211(t)).
