TI  == evolution for exogenous octanoic acid tolerance improves carboxylic acid production and membrane integrity.
AB  == carboxylic acids are an attractive biorenewable chemical, but as with many biorenewables, their toxicity to microbial biocatalysts limits their fermentative production. while it is generally accepted that membrane damage is the main mechanism of fatty acid toxicity, previous metabolic engineering efforts that increased membrane integrity did not enable increased carboxylic acid production. here we used an evolutionary approach to improve tolerance to exogenous octanoic  acid, with the goal of learning design strategies from this evolved strain. this  evolution of an escherichia coli mg1655 derivative at neutral ph in minimal media produced a strain with increased tolerance not only to octanoic acid, but also to hexanoic acid, decanoic acid, n-butanol and isobutanol. this evolved strain also  produced carboxylic acids at a 5-fold higher titer than its parent strain when expressing the anaerococcus tetradius thioesterase. while it has been previously  suggested that intracellular acidification may contribute to carboxylic acid toxicity, we saw no evidence that the evolved strain has increased resistance to  this acidification. characterization of the evolved strain membrane showed that it had significantly altered membrane polarization (fluidity), integrity (leakage) and composition relative to its parent. the changes in membrane composition included a significant increase in average lipid length in a variety  of growth conditions, including 30 degrees c, 42 degrees c, carboxylic acid challenge and ethanol challenge. the evolved strain has a more dynamic membrane composition, showing both a larger number of significant changes and larger fold  changes in the relative abundance of membrane lipids. these results highlight the importance of the cell membrane in increasing microbial tolerance and production  of biorenewable fuels and chemicals.

TI  == modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  == at high altitude (ha) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (gi) disorder are very  common phenomena. to explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the gi functions, were subjected following  simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. for this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kpa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. it was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. the population density of strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (gdi). in relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of iga and igg increased in duration dependent manner. the activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered gsh/gssg pool in the intestinal epithelia. histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. it can be concluded that hypoxia at ha modified gi microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small  intestinal dysfunction at ha.

TI  == microbiology and antibiotic sensitivity of head and neck space infections of odontogenic origin.
AB  == this paper aim to assess the anatomical spaces of head and neck region and causative microorganisms responsible for infections, evaluate the resistance of antibiotics used in treatment and compare the findings with previously reported microbial flora in the orofacial infection. forty-two patients were recorded. all underwent surgical incision and drainage, received antibiotics cover, and had culture and sensitivity test performed for gram positive and gram negative aerobes. there were 33 male (78.57 %) and 9 female (21.42 %). out of the 42 patients 28 (66.66 %) presented with single space involvement. the submandibular  space was the most frequent location for single space abscess (28.12 %). fourteen patients presented with multiple space involvement, with a total of 64 spaces being involved. forty microorganisms were isolated. there were 28 aerobes and 10  anaerobes. two fungi were also identified. the most common bacteria isolated were staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus. the key  issue here, which needs to be remembered, is that antibiotics alone cannot resolve odontogenic infection satisfactorily. quick recovery of patients results  with proper basic management comprising of early drainage/decompression which is  equally important.

TI  == alteration of predominant gastrointestinal flora and oxidative damage of large intestine under simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  == hypobaric hypoxia is an immediate and crucial starting mechanism of acute mountain sickness included with some non-specific gastrointestinal (gi) complications. to study the effect of hypoxia on gi microflora and its upshot to  this system, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kpa (air pressure ~ 4872.9 m altitude) consecutively 30 days for 8 hours/day. the different indicator group of large intestinal microbial populations were enumerated and correlated with the levels of antioxidant indicators like catalase (cat), superoxide dismutase (sod), malondialdehyde (mda), reduced glutathione (gsh) and oxidized glutathione (gssg)  of large intestinal epithelial cells. in addition, the histological study was performed by haematoxylin eosin (he), periodic acid schiff staining (pas) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). it was observed that the density of total aerobes (104 folds) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased but the population of total anaerobes (209 folds) and escherichia coli (125 folds) elevated after 30 days of hypoxic stress. the strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium spp. (3 folds), bacteroides spp. (134 folds), lactobacillus spp. (7 folds) and other selected obligate anaerobes like clostridium perfringens (40 folds), peptostreptococcus spp. (21 folds) increased in respect to their control population. the growth direction index (gdi) of anaerobic populations was positive and correlated with gas formation aptitude. the activities of cat and sod in the large intestinal epithelia decreased significantly (p < 0.05) and gsh/gssg pool turned into oxidized state with higher mda (p < 0.05) formation. histological study revealed  the necrotized epithelial layer with higher lymphocytes infiltration in lamina propia accompanied by reduction of acidic mucins secreting goblet cells. from this experiment, it can be hypothesized that high altitude induced hypoxia manipulated the bacterial imprint and damaged the epithelial barrier of the large intestine which may cause systemic infection.

TI  == in vivo proton mr spectroscopy in uterine abscesses.
AB  == it is important to make a rapid diagnosis to provide appropriate treatment, however, specific diagnosis of causative organisms of pelvic abscesses on conventional mr imaging is difficult. mr spectroscopy provides metabolic information noninvasively, and has the potential to characterize etiology of the  abscesses. the presence of acetate (ac) peak with or without succinate (suc) peak may suggest anaerobic bacterial infection, whereas the absence of ac and suc peaks in the spectra may suggest aerobic infection. this report describes two cases of uterine pyogenic abscesses, which showed ac and suc peaks on in vivo mr  spectroscopy.

TI  == bacterial colonization of microbial biofilms in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this prospective clinical study was to identify the bacterial spectra on the surface of oral squamous cell carcinomas (oscc) in comparison to oral mucosa of patients with a higher risk to emerge an oscc and a  control group to determine their susceptibility to various common antibiotics. material and methods: swabs from 90 patients, 30 patients of each group, were cultured on media for aerobes and anaerobes and tested with agar diffusion and etest. results: the predominant pathogens of the normal healthy oral mucosa were  aerobes. the ratio between aerobes and anaerobes was 2:1, balanced in risk patients and inverted in the oscc group. altogether, 1,006 isolates were cultured. the most frequent strains were 47 viridans streptococci, 30 staphylococcus species, 14 enterococcus faecalis, 36 neisseria species, 14 escherichia coli, and 23 other aerobes, 66 peptostreptococcus species, 39 fusobacterium species, and 34 prevotella species. the resistance rates in the oscc group were penicillin 40%, ampicillin 57%, doxycycline 23%, clindamycin 47%, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 20%, but up to 100% of pathogens were susceptible to azithromycin, telithromycin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. conclusion: gram-negative anaerobes play a decisive role in the development of postoperative  infections in patients with oscc. this tumor special type of colonization does not agree with the normal flora of the oral cavity. clinical relevance: biofilms  on oscc surfaces provide an important reservoir for anaerobic bacteria. as a consequence, a proposal for an antibiotic prophylactic regime should be given.

TI  == regioselective covalent immobilization of recombinant antibody-binding proteins a, g, and l for construction of antibody arrays.
AB  == immobilized antibodies are useful for the detection of antigens in highly sensitive microarray diagnostic applications. arrays with the antibodies attached regioselectively in a uniform orientation are typically more sensitive than those with random orientations. direct regioselective immobilization of antibodies on a solid support typically requires a modified form of the protein. we now report a  general approach for the regioselective attachment of antibodies to a surface using truncated forms of antibody-binding proteins a, g, and l that retain the structural motifs required for antibody binding. the recombinant proteins have a  c-terminal cvix protein farnesyltransferase recognition motif that allows us to append a bioorthogonal azide or alkyne moiety and use the cu(i)-catalyzed huisgen cycloaddition to attach the binding proteins to a suitably modified glass surface. this approach offers several advantages. the recombinant antibody-binding proteins are produced in escherichia coli, chemoselectively modified posttranslationally in the cell-free homogenate, and directly attached to the glass surface without the need for purification at any stage of the process. complexes between immobilized recombinant proteins a, g, and l and their respective strongly bound antibodies were stable to repeated washing with pbst buffer at ph 7.2. however, the antibodies could be stripped from the slides by treatment with 0.1 m glycine.hcl buffer, ph 2.6, for 30 min and regenerated by shaking with pbs buffer, ph 7.2, at 4 degrees c overnight. the recombinant forms  of proteins a, g, and l can be used separately or in combination to give glass surfaces capable of binding a wide variety of antibodies.

TI  == microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  == sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (ssi). the present investigation characterized microbial  recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (ab) and nonabsorbable (nab) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. ab and nab sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. at explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (sem). bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. a significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (p < 0.05) was noted. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected  devices. no significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (p < 0.042). we  conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface  for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from  infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and  (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.

TI  == primary retroperitoneal abscess caused by candida glabrata.
AB  == clinically, retroperitoneal abscesses present insidiously and the diagnosis may be delayed. this, with inadequate drainage, may result in increased morbidity and mortality. most cases result from a renal or gastrointestinal process, but in a small number of patients there is no identifiable source and the abscess is designated as "primary." most retroperitoneal abscesses are polymicrobial, and cultures often reveal organisms such as proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus species, peptostreptococcus, enterococcus, enterobacter, escherichia coli and bacteroides species. fungal causes appear to be very rare, and in this study, a case of a patient with primary candida glabrata retroperitoneal abscess is reported.

TI  == evaluation of impact of exposure of sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. in this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on  11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. among the tested bacteria, cell  growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively. at the tested concentration of 100 mum, sudan i and ii inhibited growth of clostridium perfringens and lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. sudan ii also affected growth of enterococcus faecalis. growth of bifidobacterium catenulatum, c. perfringens, e.  faecalis, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by sudan iii and iv with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. c. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by para red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. however, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. the dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. clostridium indolis and clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of sudan azo dyes. the present results suggested that sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.

TI  == necrotizing fasciitis caused by a primary appendicocutaneous fistula.
AB  == we report a case of necrotizing fasciitis in the loin of a 76-year old man with several coexisting or past health issues, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, alcohol-related liver cirrhosis, gastrectomy for gastric cancer, subarachnoid hemorrhage, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and cerebral infarction.  incision of the necrotizing fasciitis was successful, but it revealed an appendicocutaneous fistula; thus, we performed appendectomy and fistulectomy. we  think that the necrotizing fasciitis was caused by appendicitis perforation involving the retroperitoneum, inducing the formation of an appendicocutaneous fistula. necrotizing fasciitis and appendicocutaneous fistulae are rare complications of appendicitis. moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first report of fluoroscopic examination demonstrating that a primary appendicocutaneous fistula had caused necrotizing fasciitis. our search of the literature found 12 cases of necrotizing fasciitis caused by preoperative appendicitis. we discuss the characteristics and findings of these cases.

TI  == appendicitis: when there is more than meets the eye.
AB  == acute appendicitis is the most frequent emergency in gastrointestinal surgery. obstruction of the appendiceal lumen appears to be one of the most common physiologic mechanisms for the development of acute appendicitis. once obstructed, the dilatation of the lumen causes ischemia and necrosis of the wall. the most common organisms involved in appendicitis are escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus, bacillus fragilis and pseudomonas. rarely, actinomyces is involved in this process. in this case report, we report a case of actinomycosis  of the appendix vermiformis occurring in a 19-year-old male with no predisposing  factors. along with a review of the literature, we will define the risk factors,  clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, and treatment of actinomycosis.

TI  == macromolecular crowding fails to fold a globular protein in cells.
AB  == proteins perform their functions in cells where macromolecular solutes reach concentrations of >300 g/l and occupy >30% of the volume. the volume excluded by  these macromolecules stabilizes globular proteins because the native state occupies less space than the denatured state. theory predicts that crowding can increase the ratio of folded to unfolded protein by a factor of 100, amounting to 3 kcal/mol of stabilization at room temperature. we tested the idea that volume exclusion dominates the crowding effect in cells using a variant of protein l, a  7 kda globular protein with seven lysine residues replaced by glutamic acids; 84% of the variant molecules populate the denatured state in dilute buffer at room temperature, compared with 0.1% for the wild-type protein. we then used in-cell nmr spectroscopy to show that the cytoplasm of escherichia coli does not overcome even this modest ( approximately 1 kcal/mol) free-energy deficit. the data are consistent with the idea that nonspecific interactions between cytoplasmic components can overcome the excluded-volume effect. evidence for these interactions is provided by the observations that adding simple salts folds the variant in dilute solution but increasing the salt concentration inside e. coli does not fold the protein. our data are consistent with the results of other studies of protein stability in cells and suggest that stabilizing excluded-volume effects, which must be present under crowded conditions, can be ameliorated by nonspecific interactions between cytoplasmic components.

TI  == sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. it is approved in japan for use  in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococcus spp., enterococcus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus spp., morganella morganii, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, peptostreptococcus spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., fusobacterium spp., chlamydia trachomatis, chlamydophila pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae. in terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in  otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, c. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin  recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

AB  == an amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees c. nine american type culture collection (atcc) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic  strains (propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium  sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (stenotrophomonas maltophilia, escherichia coli ([atcc 25922 and atcc 11775], salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and lactobacillus casei). the bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal  samples. there were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline  and after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of p. anaerobius. for p. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. the tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == [identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of  local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. this study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. one hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal  fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during march 20-october 30 2007, were included in the study. the specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to wilkins chalgren agar, schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with api 20a panels (bio-merieux, france) via conventional methods and by the help of an-ident discs  (oxoid, england). penicillin g, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with e-  test method. twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 escherichia coli and 4 enterococcus spp.) growth. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. the distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), bacteroides spp. other than b.fragilis (n = 4), clostridium spp. (n = 2), fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), peptococcus niger (n = 2), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 b. fragilis isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and  piperacillin/tazobactam. the highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin g (9/22; 41%). while anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found  to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. the results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at konya area in turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.

TI  == innate inflammatory responses of human decidual cells to periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontopathic bacteria exert potent proinflammatory effects in human decidua.  study design: the immunostimulatory effects of gram-positive and negative periodontopathic bacteria and their lipopolysaccharides were tested in human decidual cell cultures in comparison with escherichia coli. cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; inflammatory gene expression was measured by oligonucleotide arrays and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. results: all bacteria that were tested elicited an inflammatory response, although concentration-dependence and efficacy varied considerably with organism and culture. lipopolysaccharides were more potent stimuli than intact bacterial cells, although bacteria exerted greater effects at high concentrations. of 112 genes on the arrays, 18 genes were stimulated significantly by one or more lipopolysaccharide preparation. conclusion: the ability of periodontopathic bacteria to stimulate a decidual inflammatory response is highly variable and partly dependent on the presence and structure of constituent lipopolysaccharides. this adds to our understanding of the causal association between periodontal disease and preterm birth.

AB  == anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. this could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. this study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and  65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. the floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), proteus mirabilis (7.7%), escherichia coli (1.4%)  and klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly  high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptococcus 12.4% and peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), bacteroides (12.4%), clostridium (3.8%), fusobacterium (2.9%) and propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. in 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only aspergillus, in association with pseudomonas and staphylococcus, was identified. the study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins  are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on pseudomonas and staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  == background: direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and dna-dna hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (orn). the purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible  after radiation therapy. design: bacterial dna was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, transformed into escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. results: from the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were  detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. the predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone fg014, uncultured bacterium clone  rl178, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella spp. the study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in orn. in contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. conclusions: diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of orn in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. to better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with orn is necessary.

TI  == maxillary sinusitis in patients ventilated for a severe head injury and with nostrils free of any foreign body.
AB  == background: this study aims to determine the frequency of maxillary sinusitis in  the patients with traumatic head injury and nostrils free of any foreign body. in addition, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography (us) for the detection of the presence of fluid in maxillary sinuses were evaluated. patients  and methods: forty patients with severe traumatic head injury were included in the study. the patients who had displaced maxillary sinus fracture at the medial  wall and naso-tracheal and/or naso-gastric tube were excluded. paranasal computed tomography (ct) was performed along with the routine cranial ct scanning or in case of unknown source of infection and compared with the results of ultrasonographic examination of maxillary sinuses performed by a single radiologist who was unaware of the ct results. in the patients, who had clinical  and radiological signs of sinusitis, a trans-nasal puncture was performed using sinoject (sinoject, atos medical, sweden), a spring-activated puncture instrument, to take a sample for microbiologic examination and to drain maxillary sinuses. results: eighty-five percent of the patients were tracheotomised on the  fifth day (on average) of their intensive care unit (icu) stay. the frequency of  sinusitis in the study group was found to be 32.5% (13 patients). the most frequently isolated species were pseudomonas spp. (37.5%), escherichia coli (20.8%) and peptostreptococcus (16.7%). five of the aspirates were polymicrobial. the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of b-mode us, compared with ct for the detection of fluid presence in maxillary sinuses in a 100 maxillary sinus examinations, were 92.2%, 81.6%, 83.9% and 90.9%, respectively. conclusion: maxillary sinusitis should be considered as  a source of infection or sepsis in patients with traumatic head injury because of its high frequency. us is likely to be used as the first-line diagnostic tool for the determination of fluid in maxillary sinuses, especially in patients who do not require ct or cannot be transported to a radiology unit for ct.

TI  == the bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. however, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include:  anaerobic gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas); fusobacterium spp; and peptostreptococcus spp. in addition, streptococcus spp (including streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have been reported. aerobic and facultative  gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are haemophilus influenzae, treponema pallidum, bartonella henselae, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. the choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.

TI  == sudan azo dyes and para red degradation by prevalent bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == sudan azo dyes have genotoxic effects and ingestion of food products contaminated with sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red could lead to exposure in the human gastrointestinal tract. in this study, we examined thirty-five prevalent species  of human intestinal bacteria to evaluate their capacity to degrade sudan dyes and para red. among these tested bacterial strains, 23, 13, 33, 30, and 29 out of 35  species tested were able to reduce sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively, to some extent. bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and ruminococcus obeum were able  to reduce completely all four tested sudan dyes and para red. escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus were the only two strains that were not able to reduce any of the tested sudan dyes and para red to any significant extent. metabolites of the reduction of the tested sudan dyes and para red by e. faecalis were isolated and identified by hplc and lc/esi-ms analyses and compared with authentic standards. thus it appears that the ability to reduce sudan dyes and para red except sudan ii is common among bacteria in the human colon.

TI  == bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis: a clinician's reference to patient management.
AB  == bisphosphonates (bps), as inhibitors of osteoclasts, are widely used in the management of metastatic bone disease and in the prevention of osteomalacia and osteoporosis. recent cases of bone necrosis of the jaws have been associated with the use of bisphosphonate therapy. a case is presented of a patient with osteonecrosis of the maxilla with a history of long-term bisphosphonate therapy for metastatic breast cancer. the authors treated the patient and suggest appropriate patient management guidelines with reference to current knowledge. although a definitive treatment for bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis has not yet been established, clinicians must be aware of the pharmacologic properties of several bisphosphonates currently available and their indications,  susceptible risk factors in the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws, the clinical signs and symptoms, and recommendations for patient management, including prevention and early recognition. bps, potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, were first introduced more than 20 years ago. since then, they have been used widely in the management of bone diseases, including hypercalcemia related to malignancy, myeloma-related bone disease, paget's disease and osteoporosis. they have also been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and inhibit angiogenesis. these additional features have made bps useful in the treatment of metastatic disease, including breast and prostate cancer, resulting in a rise in the medical use of these drugs. however, recent reports suggest that bps, particularly the nitrogen-containing bps pamidronate (aredia) and zoledronic acid (zometa), both manufactured by novartis of east hanover, nj, are capable of causing bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (bon). with 2.5 million patients treated with pamidronate and/or zoledronate worldwide, bon occurs in about one per 10,000 treated patients (novartis, unpublished data, 2004). currently, the total number of reported cases associated with alendronate (fosamax, merck and co. inc., white-house station, nj) the most commonly prescribed oral bisphosphonate, is approximately 170 worldwide (c. arsver, oral communication, march 2006). this corresponds to a spontaneous bon incidence of approximately 0.7 cases per 100,000-years exposure.  however, there is insufficient data to determine why the osteonecrosis reported seems to particularly affect the jaw, with a slightly higher rate in the mandible than the maxilla. this report concerns the management of a patient with bon. information provided includes: the pharmacologic properties of the several bisphosphonates currently available; the pathobiological mechanism; the clinical  presentation of the oral lesions; and recommendations for the oral management of  patients who have received bp therapy, with consideration of a preventative approach based on current knowledge.

TI  == recombinant production of a vl single domain antibody in escherichia coli and analysis of its interaction with peptostreptococcal protein l.
AB  == a kappa-light chain from a fab expression system was truncated by the insertion of a stop codon in the gene sequence to produce a variable light (vl) single domain antibody (dab). here, we describe the expression of dab in the periplasm of escherichia coli through fermentation in a defined media. immunoglobulin binding domains from peptostreptococcal protein l (ppl) have been shown to bind specifically to kappa-light chains. we have produced recombinant ppl, at high yield, and this was used to custom-produce ppl-sepharose affinity columns. here,  we show that the affinity purification of vl dab by this method is simple and efficient with no apparent loss in protein at any stage. the truncated dab protein product was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry and n-terminal sequencing. when analyzed by sds-page it was shown to be over 95% pure and produced at yields of 35-65 mg/l of culture medium. the dab protein produced was  shown by nmr and cd to be a folded beta-sheet domain. this domain is bound by ppl with a kd of approximately 50 nm as determined by stopped-flow fluorimetry.

TI  == microbiological analysis and endoanal ultrasonography for diagnosis of anal fistula in acute anorectal sepsis.
AB  == background and aims: treatment of anorectal sepsis requires prompt surgical drainage, but it is important to identify any associated anal fistula for preventing recurrence. we evaluated whether microbiological analysis and/or endoanal ultrasonography could be used to predict anal fistula in patients with acute anorectal sepsis. methods: five hundred fourteen consecutive patients with  acute anorectal sepsis were studied. clinical data, digital examination findings, endosonographic findings, and results of microbiological analysis were compared with definitive surgical findings of the presence or absence of anal fistula. results: anorectal abscess with anal fistula was found in 418 patients, and anorectal abscess without anal fistula was found in 96 patients. microbiological  examination showed that escherichia coli, bacteroides, bacillus, and klebsiella species were significantly more prevalent in patients with fistula (p<0.01), and  coagulase-negative staphylococci and peptostreptococcus species were significantly more prevalent in patients without fistula (p<0.01). results of endoanal ultrasonography were concordant with the definitive surgical diagnosis in 421 (94%) of 448 patients studied. conclusion: acute anorectal sepsis due to colonization of "gut-derived" microorganisms rather than "skin-derived" organisms is more likely to be associated with anal fistula. when the microbiological analysis yields gut-derived bacteria, but no fistula has been found in the initial drainage operation, repeat examinations during a period of quiescence, including careful digital assessment and meticulous endosonography, are warranted to identify a potentially missed anal fistula.

TI  == [soft tissue infections in oral, maxillofacial, and plastic surgery. bacterial spectra and antibiotics].
AB  == background: soft tissue infections in the maxillofacial region are mainly caused  by staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli but also by members of the genera enterococcus, klebsiella, and enterobacter, respectively. methods: in a prospective study 96 patients with severe maxillofacial non-odontogenic postoperative soft tissue infections were analyzed  with regard to the bacterial spectrum and resistance patterns against antibiotics. the dominating bacteria were streptococci (25% of the isolates) and  staphylococci (24% of the isolates). in addition, members of enterobacteriaceae were isolated in approximately 10% of the cases. the most frequent anaerobes found were as follows: peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, prevotella and fusobacterium. results: the resistance rates against antibiotics found were: penicillin g 36%, ampicillin 42%, and doxycycline 36%. in addition, the resistance rate against erythromycin and clindamycin was 26% and 7%, respectively. no resistant strains were detected against vancomycin and teicoplanin. all anaerobes showed a low antimicrobial resistance as previously described for odontogenic infections. conclusion: in summary, soft tissue infections in the maxillofacial region present a different spectrum of bacteria in contrast to the well-investigated odontogenic infections. antibiotic administration should be, whenever possible, performed after differentiation of involved strains and resistogram. the most promising antibiotics are imipenem, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin as well as cefotiam. modern fluoroquinolones will be the antibiotics of the future.

AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == trypanosoma cruzi: influence of predominant bacteria from indigenous digestive microbiota on experimental infection in mice.
AB  == to verify the influence of some predominant components from indigenous microbiota on systemic immunological responses during experimental chagas disease, germ-free nih swiss mice were mono-associated with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides vulgatus or peptostreptococcus sp. and then infected with the y strain of trypanosoma cruzi. all the mono-associations predominantly induced a th1 type of specific immune response to the infection by t. cruzi. a direct correlation was observed between a higher survival rate and increased ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha production (p<0.05) in e. faecalis-, b. vulgatus-, and peptostreptococcus-associated mice. moreover, higher levels of anti-t. cruzi igg1 and anti-t. cruzi igg2a were also found in mono-associated animals after infection. on the other hand, with the exception of e. faecalis-associated mice,  mono-association induced a lower il-10 production after infection (p<0.05) when compared with germ-free animals. interestingly, spleen cell cultures from non-infected germ-free and mono-associated mice spontaneously produced higher levels (p<0.05) of il-10 than cultures from infected mono-associated mice, except again for e. faecalis-associated animals. in conclusion, the presence of the components of the indigenous microbiota skews the immune response towards production of inflammatory cytokines during experimental infection with t. cruzi  in gnotobiotic mice. however, the degree of increase in production of cytokines depends on each bacterial component.

TI  == bacterial diversity in necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis in hiv-positive subjects.
AB  == background: necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup) is a painful and potentially debilitating affliction that affects about 2% to 6% of hiv-positive subjects. nup may be caused by specific microorganisms that are presently unknown or by microbial species not usually thought to cause periodontal infections. the  purpose of this study was to define the bacterial species associated with nup in  hiv-positive patients. methods: 16s rrna bacterial genes of dna isolated from subgingival plaque of 8 hiv-positive subjects with nup were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and cloned into escherichia coli. the sequences of cloned inserts were used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences. the microbial profiles in subgingival plaque of  subjects with nup, chronic periodontitis, and periodontal health were compared using a battery of over 200 oligonucleotide probes in a pcr-based, reverse-capture, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay. results: sequence analysis of over 400 clones revealed 108 species; 65 were "uncultivable" phylotypes, of which 26 were novel to nup subjects. species or phylotypes most commonly detected were bulleidia extructa, dialister, fusobacterium, selenomonas, peptostreptococcus, veillonella, and the phylum tm7. based on sequence analysis and checkerboard analysis, nup did not possess the classical periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis. otherwise, the microbial profiles of  nup and periodontitis had many similarities. the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque from periodontally healthy subjects were different and less complex in comparison to the profiles of both disease groups. conclusions: certain species appear to be associated with health and periodontal diseases. the putative pathogens associated with periodontal disease in hiv-negative subjects are not associated with nup in hiv-positive subjects.

TI  == toll-like receptors-2, -3 and -4 expression patterns on human colon and their regulation by mucosal-associated bacteria.
AB  == the colonic epithelium provides an interface between the host and micro-organisms colonising the gastrointestinal tract. molecular recognition of bacteria is facilitated through toll-like receptors (tlr). the colonic epithelium expresses relatively high levels of mrna for tlr3 and less for tlr2 and -4. little is known of the expression patterns and mode of induction of expression for these pattern  recognition receptors in human colon. the aim of this study was to investigate their localization in the gut and induction of expression in epithelial cell lines by mucosal bacteria. tlr2 and -4 were expressed only in crypt epithelial cells, expression was lost as the cells matured and moved towards the gut lumen.  in contrast, tlr3 was only produced in mature epithelial cells. ht29 and caco-2 had different levels of expression for tlr1-4. co-culture of ht29 cells with different mucosal isolates showed that they were highly responsive to bacterial challenge, with up-regulation of mrna for tlr1-4. in contrast, caco-2 cells were  refractive to bacterial challenge, showing little difference in mrna levels. tlr3 was induced in ht29 only by gram-positive commensals with up-regulation of both mrna and protein and an enhancement of the antiviral immune response. this pattern of expression allows induction of responsiveness to bacteria only by the  crypt epithelium so that tolerance to commensal organisms can be maintained. in contrast, mature columnar epithelium is able to respond to viral pathogens, which are not part of the normal gut commensal microbiota.

TI  == microbiology and management of intra-abdominal infections in children.
AB  == the present review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal infections in children. infection generally occurs due to the entry of enteric micro-organisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from the peritoneal cavity of these patients. the predominant aerobic isolates are escherichia coli, and enterococci; the main anaerobic bacteria are bacteroides fragilis group, peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. the treatment of abdominal infection includes surgical correction and drainage, and administration of antimicrobials that are effective against both aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms.

TI  == comparison of ligand polarization and enzyme activation in medium- and short-chain acyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase-novel analog complexes.
AB  == spectroelectrochemical and off-resonance raman indicate that substrate/product binding to medium-chain acyl-coenzyme a (coa) dehydrogenase (pmcad) results in ligand polarization and positive flavin potential shifts, which activate the enzyme for electron transfer. bacterial short-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase (bscad) typically exhibits smaller potential shifts upon substrate/product binding that have not been linked to ligand polarization. to further investigate  the roles of ligand binding and polarization in activation, several novel aromatic carboxyloyl-coas were designed. these analogs allowed for the first direct comparison of pmcad and bscad mechanisms. the results indicate that pmcad  activation can occur without perceptible analog polarization. bscad data provide  the first spectral evidence of ligand polarization. the potential alterations exhibited by ligand-bound bscad are smaller than those of pmcad, while their directionality and magnitude suggest differing enzyme-analog interactions. such data provide the first indication of variations in the activation mechanism of these enzymes, which were thought to be comparable in both structure and function.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  == objectives: to assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (bl) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (aecb). methods: the microbiology, bl production by the different isolates, and bl contents in the sputum were determined. results: eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). the predominant aerobic isolates were streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), haemophilus influenzae (11), moraxella catarrhalis and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (19), prevotella sp. (11), and fusobacterium sp.(6). mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. the predominant aerobic blpb were h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the predominant anaerobic blpb were prevotella sp. and fusobacterium sp. beta-lactamase activity  was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which blpb were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor blpb. conclusions: the rapid detection of bl activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with aecb.

TI  == chi1 torsion angle dynamics in proteins from dipolar couplings.
AB  == experiments are presented for the measurement of one-bond carbon-proton dipolar coupling values at ch and ch2 ositions in 13c-labeled, approximately 50% fractionally deuterated proteins. 13cbeta-1hbeta dipolar couplings have been measured for 38 of 49 possible residues in the 63-amino-acid b1 domain of peptostreptococcal protein l in two aligning media and interpreted in the context of side-chain chi1 torsion angle dynamics. the beta protons for 18 of the 25 beta-methylene-containing amino acids for which dipolar data are available can be unambiguously stereoassigned, and for those residues which are best fit to a single rotamer model the chi(1) angles obtained deviate from crystal structure values by only 5.2 degrees (rmsd). the results for 11 other residues are significantly better fit by a model that assumes jumps between the three canonical (chi1 approximately -60 degrees, 60 degrees, 180 degrees ) rotamers. relative populations of the rotamers are determined to within +/-6% uncertainty on average and correlate with dihedral angles observed for the three molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit. entropic penalties for quenching chi1 jumps are considered for six mobile residues thought to be involved in binding to human immunoglobulins. this study demonstrates that dipolar couplings may be used to characterize both the conformation of static residues and side-chain motion with  high precision.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, s-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  == carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. s-4661, a new injectable carbapenem  antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase i. we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of s-4661 against strains of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. the mic(50) and  mic(90) of s-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/l, respectively. the in vivo efficacy of s-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by e. coli and b. fragilis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the s-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. these results suggest that s-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.

AB  == we reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in kandang kerbau hospital between 1st january 1993 to 31st december 1995. there were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. there were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases),  urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). one of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. there was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. we could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. the most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were acinetobacter baumanii (2), escherichia coli (1), klebsiella sp. (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (1), streptococcus group f (1), peptostreptococcus species and veillonella species (1). there was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful  recovery in all the cases.

TI  == translocation of indigenous microflora in an experimental model of sepsis.
AB  == translocation of viable bacteria from gut to bloodstream and other sterile body sites during shock has been demonstrated in several experimental and clinical studies. the factors causing translocation and its incidence at different stages  of shock are not known. the aim of the study was to evaluate the importance of several factors causing translocation of indigenous microflora in an experimental model of septic shock based on intraperitoneal escherichia coli sepsis in rats. counts of inoculated e. coli and translocated bacteria in different locations, gut morphology and haematological values were evaluated at different stages of sepsis. sepsis developed in all animals and e. coli achieved the highest counts in blood 6 h after inoculation. translocation was commonest at 6 and 12 h after inoculation. frequently translocating bacteria were lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, bacteroides and peptostreptococci. in early sepsis, translocation was associated  with high e. coli counts in blood, yet in late sepsis the opposite correlation was present. low infiltration by neutrophils in the ileum and decreased mitotic activity in the colon were associated with a high translocation rate. in early sepsis, translocation was associated with low lymphocyte counts, but in late sepsis, with low neutrophil counts. translocation of bacteria (including anaerobes) that colonise the gut in high counts takes place during sepsis. putative influencing factors such as activity of the primary disease (bacterial counts in blood), gut morphology or haematological values seem to have different  impacts on translocation, depending on the stage of the disease.

TI  == an experimental mouse model to study the pathogenicity of prevotella bivia and investigations of possible virulence.
AB  == induction of subcutaneous abscesses in mice was used to study the pathogenicity of prevotella bivia both in mono-infection and in mixed cultures with escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus spp. virulence factors such as coaggregation and aggregate formation of cells, haemagglutination activity and tolerance to serum bactericidal activity were investigated for their possible role in p bivia pathogenicity. monocultures of p bivia, e coli and peptostreptococcus spp did not induce subcutaneous abscess at concentrations as high as 10(9) colony forming units/millilitre (cfu/ml). only e coli persisted at the infection site for up to  7 days post infection but with a marked decline in cell count (8.0 x 10(2) cfu/ml). the anaerobic organisms did not persist at the infection sites beyond the fifth day. in contrast, mixed cultures of p bivia and e coli or all three organisms potentiated for infective abscess two weeks after infection. viable cells were recovered from abscesses in greater numbers as the infection progressed. prevotella bivia was the predominant organism in chronic abscesses while e coli predominated in abscesses in the acute stage of the infection. prevotella bivia lacked haemagglutination activity against human and sheep erythrocytes and showed marked susceptibility to 50 per cent human serum. these may limit its haematogenous spread. its ability to form aggregates in molar salt  solutions and coaggregate with facultative organisms may account for its persistence in pathological sites.

TI  == expression of a heterologous glutamate dehydrogenase gene in lactococcus lactis highly improves the conversion of amino acids to aroma compounds.
AB  == the first step of amino acid degradation in lactococci is a transamination, which requires an alpha-keto acid as the amino group acceptor. we have previously shown that the level of available alpha-keto acid in semihard cheese is the first limiting factor for conversion of amino acids to aroma compounds, since aroma formation is greatly enhanced by adding alpha-ketoglutarate to cheese curd. in this study we introduced a heterologous catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) gene into lactococcus lactis so that this organism could produce alpha-ketoglutarate from glutamate, which is present at high levels in cheese. then we evaluated the impact of gdh activity on amino acid conversion in in vitro tests and in a cheese model by using radiolabeled amino acids as tracers. the gdh-producing lactococcal strain degraded amino acids without added alpha-ketoglutarate to the same extent that the wild-type strain degraded amino acids with added alpha-ketoglutarate. interestingly, the gdh-producing lactococcal strain produced a higher proportion of carboxylic acids, which are major aroma compounds. our results demonstrated that a gdh-producing lactococcal  strain could be used instead of adding alpha-ketoglutarate to improve aroma development in cheese.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == minimal debridement in the treatment of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == scrotal and perineal gangrene of the male genitalia was first described by fournier in 1883. treatment of the disease remains surgical despite the availability of modern antibiotics. many authors advocate a wide debridement of all tissue superficial to the involved fascial layers. we have reviewed our experience of using wide and minimal debridement as the surgical technique of choice. in our retrospective study, nine patients were diagnosed and treated over a 2-year period for fournier's gangrene. the mean age was 65+/-28 years. two patients were admitted from chronic care facilities, four were diabetic, and two  had taken oral steroids. five of the nine patients were treated with the technique of minimal tissue debridement. in brief, the scrotum was bivalved along the median raphe, each scrotal sac was drained, and the testicles were exteriorized. orchiectomy was performed if the testicles were grossly necrotic. penrose drains were inserted from each scrotal sac to the counterincision at the  level of the internal rings. all of the tissue involved was irrigated with betadine and peroxide, after debridement of the necrotic tissue. broad-spectrum antibiotics along with daily packing were continued for 4 to 6 weeks; at the end  of that time the testicles were returned to the scrotum and the skin was loosely  reapproximated. three of the nine patients were treated with wide debridement of  all the soft tissue including the fascia. one of the patients displayed gangrene  of the entire abdominal wall; he was not a surgical candidate and died 3 days later. the four patients treated with minimal debridement all obtained successful treatment of their fasciitis. however, one died of complications related to a duodenal ulcer. the mean hospital stay was 45+/-10 days. two of the three patients treated with wide debridement required plastic reconstruction using a skin-muscle flap of the perineum. the remaining patient treated with wide debridement died of complications related to metastatic renal carcinoma. the mean hospital stay of this group was 62+/-12 days. the specific flora included: bacteroidis fragilis in 87 per cent, peptostreptococcus and streptococcus in 75 per cent, clostridia group, escherichia coli, enterobacter and pseudomonas in 62  per cent, klebsiella in 50 per cent, staphylococcus in 37 per cent, and proteus in 12 per cent of the patients. in the surgical management of fournier's gangrene, wide drainage with minimal debridement resulted in similar morbidity and shorter hospital stay when compared with extensive debridement.

TI  == in vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  == it has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to  utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. the six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules a (amylose; sigma) and b (culture pro 958n). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. it was demonstrated that bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and strains of eubacterium, clostridium, streptococcus, and propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only bifidobacterium spp. and clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. in fact, c. butyricum and bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on bifidobacterium and bacteroides cells and were extracellular for c. butyricum. active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on sds-page gels showed that the bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (m(r)) weights (>160,000),  medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). it was concluded that bifidobacterium spp. and c. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.

AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == differential induction of colitis and gastritis in hla-b27 transgenic rats selectively colonized with bacteroides vulgatus or escherichia coli.
AB  == resident bacteria play an important role in initiating and perpetuating gastrointestinal inflammation. we previously demonstrated that six commensal bacteria including bacteroides vulgatus caused more aggressive colitis and gastritis in hla-b27 transgenic rats than did the other five bacteria without b.  vulgatus. this study compared the degree of gastrointestinal inflammation in gnotobiotic hla-b27 transgenic rats monoassociated with either b. vulgatus or escherichia coli. gnotobiotic transgenic rats raised in trexler isolators were selectively colonized with either b. vulgatus or e. coli. control rats were either germfree or colonized with six common commensal bacteria (streptococcus faecium, e. coli, streptococcus avium, eubacterium contortum, peptostreptococcus  productus, and b. vulgatus [desep-b]). after 1 month, all the rats were killed and tissues were prepared for histologic and biochemical evaluation. colitis induced by b. vulgatus monoassociation was almost equal to that in desep-b-colonized rats and was significantly more severe than e. coli-induced colitis, which was absent by histological testing and mild by colonic myeloperoxidase and interleukin-1beta concentration determinations. however, gastritis was detectable only in desep-b-associated rats. these studies suggest that not all resident bacteria have equal proinflammatory capabilities, since b.  vulgatus alone is more active than e. coli alone in inducing colitis, and that colitis and gastritis result from different luminal bacterial stimuli.

TI  == prevalence of corynebacterial 16s rrna sequences in patients with bacterial and "nonbacterial" prostatitis.
AB  == the etiology of chronic prostatitis syndromes in men is controversial, particularly when positive cultures for established uropathogens are lacking. although identification of bacteria in prostatic fluid has relied on cultivation  and microscopy, most microorganisms in the environment, including some human pathogens, are resistant to cultivation. we report here on an rrna-based molecular phylogenetic approach to the identification of bacteria in prostate fluid from prostatitis patients. positive bacterial signals were seen for 65% of  patients with chronic prostatitis overall. seven of 11 patients with bacterial signals but none of 6 patients without bacterial signals were cured with antibiotic-based therapy. results indicate the occurrence in the prostate fluid of a wide spectrum of bacterial species representing several genera. most rrna genes were closely related to those of species belonging to the genera corynebacterium, staphylococcus, peptostreptococcus, streptococcus, and escherichia. unexpectedly, a wide diversity of corynebacterium species was found  in high proportion compared to the proportions of other bacterial species found.  a subset of these 16s rrna sequences represent those of undescribed species on the basis of their positions in phylogenetic trees. these uncharacterized organisms were not detected in control samples, suggesting that the organisms have a role in the disease or are the consequence of the disease. these studies show that microorganisms associated with prostatitis generally occur as complex microbial communities that differ between patients. the results also indicate that microbial communities distinct from those associated with prostatitis may occur at low levels in normal prostatic fluid.

TI  == bacterial populations contaminating the upper gut in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome.
AB  == objective: small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome (sibos) is characterized by an abnormally high bacterial population level in the upper gut,  exceeding 10(5) organisms/ml (5 log colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml). to understand  its origin and select an appropriate antibiotic treatment, we have analyzed the bacterial populations contaminating the upper gut in sibos patients. methods: jejunal samples of 63 consecutive patients with diarrhea or malabsorption and conditions predisposing to sibos were cultured and antibiotic sensitivities determined. results: concentrations of total, microaerophilic, and anaerobic bacteria were confirmed in 55 patients with sibos (mean +/- se) 7.6 +/- 0.8, 7.4  +/- 0.9, and 6.1 +/- 0.7 log cfu/ml, respectively. mean number of bacterial genera was 4.6 +/- 0.8. the main bacteria recovered were (mean +/- se log cfu/ml) streptococcus (71%; 6.4 +/- 0.8), escherichia coli (69%; 7.2 +/- 0.9), staphylococcus (25%; 6.2 +/- 0.6), micrococcus (22%; 6.0 +/- 0.7), klebsiella (20%; 7.1 +/- 0.8), proteus (11%; 6.1 +/- 0.8) for microaerophilic bacteria, and  lactobacillus (75%; 6.1 +/- 1.1), bacteroides (29%; 6.9 +/- 1.3), clostridium (25%; 5.5 +/- 1.0), veillonella (25%; 5.3 +/- 0.7), fusobacterium (13%; 4.8 +/- 0.5), and peptostreptococcus (13%; 6.1 +/- 0.7) for anaerobic bacteria. amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefoxitin were efficient on >90% of strains. conclusions: contaminating flora isolated in sibos include commonly identified oropharyngeal and colonic flora, but these occur in sibos at different levels from those usually found in their original location. these data may hopefully serve as a starting point to further therapeutic controlled studies.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of surgical-site infection following spinal fusion.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of surgical-site infections (ssi) following spinal fusion was retrospectively studied. this was done by reviewing the clinical and microbiological records at the naval hospital in bethesda, md.,  from 1980 to 1992. aspirates of pus from 25 infection sites showed bacterial growth. aerobic bacteria only were recovered from 9 (36%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered from 4 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 12 (48%). sixty isolates were recovered: 38 aerobes  (1.5 isolates per specimen) and 22 anaerobes (0.9 isolate per specimen). the predominant aerobes were escherichia coli (n = 8) and proteus sp. (n = 7). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis group (n = 9) and peptostreptococcus sp. (n = 6) isolates. an increase in recovery of e. coli and b. fragilis was noted in patients with bowel or bladder incontinence. this study  highlights the polymicrobial nature of ssi and the importance of anaerobic bacteria in ssi following spinal fusion.

TI  == purification and properties of nadh-dependent 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (metf) from escherichia coli.
AB  == a k-12 strain of escherichia coli that overproduces methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (metf) has been constructed, and the enzyme has been purified to apparent homogeneity. a plasmid specifying metf with six histidine residues added to the c terminus has been used to purify histidine-tagged metf to homogeneity in a single step by affinity chromatography on nickel-agarose, yielding a preparation with specific activity comparable to that of the unmodified enzyme. the native protein comprises four identical 33-kda subunits, each of which contains a molecule of noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad). no  additional cofactors or metals have been detected. the purified enzyme catalyzes  the reduction of methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate, using nadh  as the reductant. kinetic parameters have been determined at 15 degreesc and ph 7.2 in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer; the km for nadh is 13 microm, the km for ch2-h4folate is 0.8 microm, and the turnover number under vmax conditions estimated for the reaction is 1,800 mol of nadh oxidized min-1 (mol of enzyme-bound fad)-1. nadph also serves as a reductant, but exhibits a much higher km. metf also catalyzes the oxidation of methyltetrahydrofolate to methylenetetrahydrofolate in the presence of menadione, which serves as an electron acceptor. the properties of metf from e. coli differ from those of the ferredoxin-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase isolated from the homoacetogen clostridium formicoaceticum and more closely resemble those of the nadh-dependent enzyme from peptostreptococcus productus and the nadph-dependent enzymes from eukaryotes.

TI  == limited internal friction in the rate-limiting step of a two-state protein folding reaction.
AB  == small, single-domain proteins typically fold via a compact transition-state ensemble in a process well fitted by a simple, two-state model. to characterize the rate-limiting conformational changes that underlie two-state folding, we have investigated experimentally the effects of changing solvent viscosity on the refolding of the igg binding domain of protein l. in conjunction with numerical simulations, our results indicate that the rate-limiting conformational changes of the folding of this domain are strongly coupled to solvent viscosity and lack  any significant "internal friction" arising from intrachain collisions. when compared with the previously determined solvent viscosity dependencies of other,  more restricted conformational changes, our results suggest that the rate-limiting folding transition involves conformational fluctuations that displace considerable amounts of solvent. reconciling evidence that the folding transition state ensemble is comprised of highly collapsed species with these and similar, previously reported results should provide a significant constraint for  theoretical models of the folding process.

AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  == the 16s rrna sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable  and condensed tannins. bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including sardinian sheep (ovis aries), honduran and colombian goats (capra hircus), white-tail deer (odocoileus  virginianus) from upstate new york, and rocky mountain elk (cervus elaphus nelsoni) from oregon. nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rrna genes,  which were obtained by pcr amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for  phylogenetic characterization. comparisons of the 16s rrna of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism streptococcus gallolyticus. one of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-g+c-content group of  gram-positive bacteria. the sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class proteobacteria. none of the 16s rrna sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism  or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in europe, north america, and south america. the presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.

AB  == germ-free rats were colonized with e. coli alone, or with e. coli plus lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of the obligate anaerobic gram-positive species, peptostreptococcus. the presence of peptostreptococcus reduced translocation of e. coli, but increased the serum antibody response to e. coli antigen. whereas the immunoglobulin g (igg) anti-e. coli antibodies largely represented cross-reactive antibodies, those of the immunoglobulin m (igm) isotype represented true anti-e. coli antibodies because they could not be absorbed by l. acidophilus or peptostreptococcus but could with e. coli. we suggest that peptostreptococci prime the gut immune system to other bacterial antigens and that this could be a mechanism behind the reduced translocation of facultative anaerobes in the presence of obligate anaerobes.

AB  == we report the case of a 70-year-old female who experienced a graft enteric erosion (gee) three years after a right aorto-femoral bypass. she was treated by  right axillo-femoral bypass, removal of the aortic prosthesis and direct aortic suture. the duodenum was stitched up and separated from the aorta by omentoplasty. bacteriological culture of the removed graft identified escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus. antibiotic therapy consisting of amoxicillin and gentamycin was given for seven days. a month later this patient developed a fibula osteomyelitis due to the same germs. she was then treated by surgical excision of the infected tissues and by antibiotics: amoxicillin, metronidazole and gentamycin for one month. this case of embolism into bone due to gee is a rare complication which indisputably establishes a link between the spontaneously septic cavity of the bowel and bone tissue by way of blood via the interstices of the fabric. the prosthesis may be responsible for blood seeding infection and not only a mere victim. the prosthesis acts as a porous membrane which allows two opposite flows: the passage of blood from graft to bowel and germ migration from  naturally septic bowel to blood. when a gee is encountered, a rigorous management is required to prevent septic embolism. the precise timing of each step of the surgical procedure remains difficult to codify.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new carbapenem bo-2727 for use in obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of bo-2727 against 100 clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae (20 strains), escherichia coli (20 strains), peptostreptococcus magnus (20 strains), bacteroides fragilis (20 strains) and prevotella bivia (20 strains) was compared with those of imipenem, panipenem, meropenem, biapenem and ceftazidime (caz). minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 50% of tested strains (mic50s) of bo-2727 against s. agalactiae, e. coli, p. magnus, b. fragilis and p. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively. mic90s of bo-2727 against s. agalactiae, e. coli, p. magnus,  b. fragilis and p. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively.  the efficacy of bo-2727 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra model (e. coli and b. fragilis) in rats. both the inflammatory changes in the uterus, from  the point of view of neutrophil accumulation, and the bacteriological response in the treated group were milder than those in either the nontreated group or the caz-treated group. these results indicate that bo-2727 may be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in patients with pyometra.

TI  == [trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  == we observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985,  1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified  in 254 among the 266 patients. their ages were less than 3 months after birth in  50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. the  causative organisms were h. influenzae in 134 patients and s. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. next to the above bacteria ranked s. agalactiae in 29 and e. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. l. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and n. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. s. pyogenes, enterococcus spp., peptostreptococcus spp., p. mirabilis and enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. the causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. h. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but s. pneumoniae  exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. there was a decreasing tendency with s. agalactiae and e. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. however, panipenem (phonetic) is  likely to be effective for insensible s. pneumoniae for the time being.

TI  == cloning and expression of the two genes coding for l-serine dehydratase from peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus: relationship of the iron-sulfur protein to both l-serine dehydratases from escherichia coli.
AB  == the structural genes sdha and sdhb, coding for the alpha- and beta-subunits of the [4fe-4s] cluster containing l-serine dehydratase from peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, have been cloned and sequenced. expression of modified sdhb together with sdha in escherichia coli led to overproduction of active his6-tagged l-serine dehydratase. e. coli mew22, deficient in the l-serine dehydratase l-sd1, was complemented by this sdhba construct. the derived amino acid sequence of sdhba shares similarities with both monomeric l-serine dehydratases, l-sd1 and l-sd2, from e. coli and with a putative l-serine dehydratase from haemophilus influenzae, which suggests that these three enzymes  are also iron-sulfur proteins.

TI  == organisms isolated from dogs and cats with anaerobic infections and susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of obligate anaerobic bacteria in bacterial infections in dogs and cats and susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents. design: case series. sample population: specimens from 1,267 dogs and 243 cats. procedure: standard anaerobic and aerobic bacterial culture methods were used. anaerobic isolates were tested for susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents. results: obligate anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 199 (15.7%) and 69 (28.4%) specimens obtained from dogs and cats, respectively. more than half of the specimens that contained obligate anaerobic bacteria were from draining tracts (exclusively dogs), pleural fluid, abscesses,  bones, the respiratory tract, or the abdominal cavity. the most commonly isolated obligate anaerobic bacteria (approx 70% of all isolates) were bacteroides spp, peptostreptococcus spp, fusobacterium spp, and porphyromonas spp. eighty percent  of the specimens that contained obligate anaerobic bacteria also contained facultative anaerobic or aerobic organisms. the organisms most commonly isolated  in association with obligate anaerobic bacteria were members of the family enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli was the most common), pasteurella spp, and staphylococcus intermedius. ninety-seven obligate anaerobic isolates were tested  for susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and metronidazole. all were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and chloramphenicol, and most were susceptible to metronidazole. only 71% of the bacteroides isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, and only 83% were susceptible to clindamycin. only 80% of the clostridium isolates were susceptible to clindamycin, but all were susceptible to ampicillin. clinical implications: data on sites and conditions from which anaerobic bacteria are commonly isolated, along with results of susceptibility testing, may be useful in designing antimicrobial treatment regimens.

TI  == synthesis by an alpha-glucosidase of glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue.
AB  == glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue were synthesized by alpha-glucosidase from aspergillus niger by using maltotetraose as a glucosyl donor and trehalose as the acceptor. the one trisaccharide and two tetrasaccharides formed were isolated by successive column chromatography. the results of an enzymatic digestion, methylation analysis, and 13c-nmr studies indicated that these oligosaccharides were alpha-isomaltosyl alpha-glucoside, alpha-isomaltotriosyl alpha-glucoside and alpha-isomaltoside. these oligosaccharides were not fermented to an acid by streptococcus mutans, and they  effectively inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by glucosyltransferase. in an in vitro utilization test with human intestinal bacteria, these oligosaccharides were predominantly utilized by bifidobacteria.

AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

AB  == as recommended by the eec, the in vitro activity of a veterinary quinolone has to be evaluated on human strains isolated from the gut and especially against anaerobes. thus, the mics for marbofloxacin were determined by the reference agar method (norma nccls m11 a3) using wilkins chalgren medium for the 124 anaerobic strains and mueller hinton agar for e. coli, proteus, enterococcus and lactobacillus. on the whole aerobes, the activity of marbofloxacin was equal or slightly greater to that of ofloxacin. the modal mic was 0.03 mg/l for enterobacteriaceae, 2 mg/l and 16 mg/l for enterococcus and lactobacillus strains, respectively. considering the anti-anaerobic activity of this new drug,  in comparison with that of ofloxacin, mics for ofloxacin were generally one log2  higher for gram negative bacilli and two log2 higher for gram positive bacilli. modal mics for marbofloxacin were 0.12 mg/l for clostridium perfringens, 0.5 mg/l for bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus strains, 1 mg/l for bifidobacteria, 2 mg/l for non-fragilis members of the b. fragilis group, and 4 mg/l for c. difficile strains, respectively. it appears in  vitro that marbofloxacin was a more potent agent than ofloxacin on the whole anaerobes.

TI  == amplified expression and large-scale purification of protein l'.
AB  == the gene fragment (ppl') encoding the functional unit of peptostreptococcus protein l was isolated using pcr and expressed in e. coli. as the gene fragment lacked its own promoter, the 5' pcr primer was designed to incorporate an nde1 restriction site (catatg) into the gene. this enabled the gene to be cloned in frame into an nde1 restriction site immediately downstream of a trp promoter. to  prevent read through, a stop codon was introduced into the 3' primer. expression  of ppl' was up to 27% total cell protein which compares favourably to the 0.1% total soluble cell protein obtained from the original clone of peptostreptococcus. following a heat step homogeneous ppl' was recovered by a single anion-exchange chromatography step on q-sepharose ff in yields of 90%.

TI  == a study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == role of escherichia coli p fimbriae in intestinal colonization in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == adherence via p fimbriae is associated with long-term persistence of escherichia  coli in the human large intestine, but a causal relationship has not been proven. in the present study, germfree rats were colonized with a mixture of two isogenic e. coli strains, one p fimbriated and the other type 1 fimbriated. both types of  fimbriae conferred adherence to rat colonic epithelial cells. with two mutant strains from a pyelonephritogenic isolate of serotype o75:k5:h-, the p-fimbriated strain 824 attained much higher numbers than its type 1-fimbriated counterpart when colonized in vivo for 2 weeks (10(10) versus 10(6) bacteria per g, respectively; p < 0.0001). the expression of p fimbriae by 824 was also retained  during colonization. with transformant isogenic strains obtained from a normal fecal isolate incapable of phase variation, no benefit of p fimbriae was seen and most bacteria lost their plasmids during in vivo colonization. when the pyelonephritogenic mutant and fecal transformant strains were combined, the former colonized at high levels while the latter were suppressed. in contrast, no suppression was seen when the transformant e. coli strains colonized in combination with lactobacillus acidophilus or peptostreptococcus sp. the results  indicate that p fimbriae, but also other bacterial traits linked to uropathogeneicity, could play an important role for persistence in the gut normal microbiota. neither p nor type 1 fimbriae seemed to contribute to the ability to  translocate to the mesenteric lymph nodes.

TI  == the ga module, a mobile albumin-binding bacterial domain, adopts a three-helix-bundle structure.
AB  == we present the first study of the secondary structure and global fold of an albumin-binding domain. our data show that the ga module from protein pab, an albumin-binding protein from the anaerobic bacterial species peptostreptococcus magnus, is composed of a left-handed three-helix bundle. the helical regions were identified by sequential and medium range noes, values of nh-c alpha h coupling constants, chemical shift indices, and the presence of slowly exchanging amide protons, as determined by nmr spectroscopy. in addition, circular dichroism studies show that the module is remarkably stable with respect to both ph and temperature.

TI  == microbiology of gastrostomy site wound infections in children.
AB  == specimens of pus were obtained from gastrostomy site wound infections in 22 children. polymicrobial flora was found in 21 of the 22 wounds. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were isolated in eight (36%) instances and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora were isolated from the other 14 (64%) wounds. a total of  102 bacterial isolates (57 aerobic and 45 anaerobic) and seven cultures of candida were obtained. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli (16 isolates). peptostreptococcus spp. (14), enterococcus spp. (14), bacteroides spp. (12) and staphylococcus aureus (6). twenty-eight strains producing beta-lactamase were isolated from 16 (73%) patients. the presence of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection, and the isolation of e. coli and bacteroides spp. were more frequent in wounds with gastric leakage than in wounds without gastric  leakage (p < 0.05). bacteria similar to those isolated from the wound were also isolated from blood cultures from three patients-two isolates of e. coli and one  each of b. fragilis and s. aureus. all patients received local therapy and 11 were treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of gastrostomy site wound infections, especially in association with gastric leakage, and the presence of beta-lactamase producers in most of these infections may have important implications for their management.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of surgical infections.
AB  == this study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both gram-negative and gram-positive surgical infections. a dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. it  was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. the times above the mic in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; haemophilus spp., 12 h; proteus mirabilis, 12 h; klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; providencia spp., 9.2 h; clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all s. aureus, 6.8 h. from the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the gram-negative anaerobes. for those  infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.

TI  == cloning, expression and purification of ppl-1, a kappa-chain binding protein, based upon protein l from peptostreptococcus magnus.
AB  == protein l is a multi-domain, cell wall constituent of certain strains of peptostreptococcus magnus, which binds to the variable domain of the l-chains of  ig. a gene fragment which codes for a single ig-binding domain of protein l (ppl-1) was cloned into a modified pkk223-3 vector and over-expressed in e. coli  jm103. a rapid protein purification protocol is described. in these studies, purified ppl-1 was immobilised on to an agarose gel and tested against an array of igs and ig fragments. it was found that ppl-1-bound igs from a number of different sources via interactions with the l kappa-chain. an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay has been developed to assay the binding of ppl-1 to igg. the  incubation of ppl-1 with human serum does not produce an immunoprecipitate, thus  suggesting one unique interaction per binding domain which has been confirmed by  elisa. these experiments demonstrate the potential value of ppl-1 as an immunological tool and as an affinity chromatography ligand for the purification  of igs.

TI  == three-dimensional solution structure of an immunoglobulin light chain-binding domain of protein l. comparison with the igg-binding domains of protein g.
AB  == protein l is a multidomain protein expressed at the surface of some strains of the anaerobic bacterial species peptostreptococcus magnus. it has affinity for immunoglobulin (ig) through interaction with framework structures in the variable ig light chain domain. the ig-binding activity is located to five homologous repeats called b1-b5 in the n-terminal part of the protein. we have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the 76 amino acid residue long b1 domain using nmr spectroscopy and distance geometry-restrained simulated annealing. the domain is composed of a 15 amino acid residue long disordered n-terminus followed by a folded portion comprising an alpha-helix packed against  a four-stranded beta-sheet. these secondary structural elements are well determined with a backbone atomic root mean square deviation from their mean of 0.54 a. the b domains of protein l show very limited sequence homology to the domains of streptococcal protein g interacting with the heavy chains of igg. however, despite this fact, and their different binding properties, the fold of the b1 domain was found to be similar to the fold of the igg-binding protein g domains [wikstrom, m., sjobring, u., kastern, w., bjorck, l., drakenberg, t., & forsen, s. (1993) biochemistry 32, 3381-3386]. in the present study, the solution structure of the b1 domain enabled a more detailed comparison which can explain the different ig-binding specificities of these two bacterial surface proteins. among the differences observed, the alpha-helix orientation is the most striking.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == prophylactic antibiotic treatment in therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ercp:  results of a randomized controlled clinical study.
AB  == the present study evaluated the effects of prophylactic administration of cefotaxime in patients undergoing therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ercp. one hundred patients were randomized to two groups of 50 patients each. patients in group 1 received an intravenous infusion of 2 g cefotaxime 15 minutes before endoscopy; patients in group 2 did not receive an intravenous antibiotic before ercp (control group). blood samples were drawn for bacteriologic cultures before  endoscopy and 5, 15, 30, and 120 minutes after beginning the procedure. bacteremia was detected by blood cultures (15- and 30-minute samples) in 4 patients who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics (escherichia coli in 2 cases, peptostreptococcus in 1, and staphylococcus aureus in 1). cholangitis or sepsis did not occur after the bacteremic episodes in any of these patients. in 4 other patients who did not receive cefotaxime-all of whom had biliary obstruction-clinical cholangitis or sepsis developed during the 3-day follow-up;  ercp had failed to decompress the biliary system completely in these 4 cases. blood cultures identified bacteria in 3 of these 4 patients (pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1, e. coli in 2). thus, bacteremia or clinical sepsis developed in  8/50 patients (16%) in the control group without antibiotic prophylaxis, whereas  no such episode was observed in patients who had received prophylactic treatment  (chi 2 = 8.7; p < 0.01). the present results indicate that prophylactic administration of an antibiotic such as cefotaxime can reduce the incidence of bacteremia and sepsis in patients who undergo therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ercp.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the functional units of a peptostreptococcal protein l.
AB  == protein l is a cell-surface protein from peptostreptococcus which interacts with  immunoglobulin kappa light chains. a gene from peptostreptococcus strain 3316 coding for protein l and fragments thereof were expressed in escherichia coli. the peptides were examined for binding to immunoglobulin and serum albumin. the four c units were shown to be responsible for binding to immunoglobulin and the four d units for binding to albumin. this protein l molecule therefore binds to albumin at a site separate from that involved in binding to immunoglobulin. the albumin-binding units have high amino acid sequence identity with the albumin-binding units of streptococcal cell-surface proteins. the gene contains three sites available for internal initiation of translation resulting in three active proteins. the protein l molecule presented in this report was compared with a previously reported protein from peptostreptococcus strain 312. the two proteins differ in several respects, including size and the number and types of repeat units.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == protein pab, a mosaic albumin-binding bacterial protein representing the first contemporary example of module shuffling.
AB  == some strains of the anaerobic human commensal and pathogen peptostreptococcus magnus bind human serum albumin (hsa), whereas other strains of this species express protein l, an immunoglobulin light chain-binding surface protein. a novel hsa-binding protein called protein pab was purified in one step from the culture  supernatant of an hsa-binding strain of p. magnus by affinity chromatography on hsa-sepharose. the apparent size of the molecular was 47 kda on sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. amino acid sequence analysis of protein pab demonstrated that the 4 nh2-terminal residues were identical to the corresponding sequence in protein l. in a polymerase chain reaction, oligonucleotides based on extragenic 5'- and 3'-end sequences of the protein l gene generated a product of the expected size: 1.3 kilobase pairs. a recombinant  protein with retained albumin binding capacity was expressed in escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequence of the protein pab gene was determined. the structural gene is 1161 nucleotides long, corresponding to a preprotein of 387 amino acids and a molecular mass of 43,043 da. unlike most other gram-positive bacterial surface proteins described, protein pab contains no internal homologies. however, substantial homologies were found to both proteins l and g (the igg- and hsa-binding surface protein of group c and g streptococci). the derived amino acid sequence of the 135-base pair-long region homologous to protein g corresponds to the hsa-binding domain of that protein, and in protein pab, this region is inserted between sequences showing extensive homology to cooh-terminal regions of peptostreptococcal protein l. this mosaic organization of protein pab demonstrates that the molecule is a product of intergenic interspecies recombination of a functional domain into a common framework for peptostreptococcal surface proteins. such an interspecies exchange of a functional protein module has previously not been described in prokaryotic cells.

TI  == peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  == 680 peptostreptococcus sp. (ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. they included 103 ps asaccharolyticus, 74 ps magnus,  56 ps prevotii, 51 ps micros, 46 ps anaerobius, 11 ps morbilorum, and 10 ps saccharolyticus. most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), ps were recovered in pure culture. most ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. these were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). the organisms most commonly isolated with ps were bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 b. fragilis group), prevotella sp. (159), fusobacterium sp. (122), escherichia coli (114), and staphylococcus aureus (97). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. these data illustrate the importance of ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dv-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == we compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of dv-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. moreover, mic50s for dv-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. dv-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and peptostreptococcus spp. at  0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the mic90 level than the other quinolones tested. the activity of dv-7751a against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the mic90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. dv-7751a showed activity comparable to  those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). dv-7751a activity  was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of dv-7751a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to dv-7751a was less than or  equal to those of the reference drugs. dv-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrases from s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.

TI  == l-serine and l-threonine dehydratase from clostridium propionicum. two enzymes with different prosthetic groups.
AB  == l-serine dehydratase from the gram-positive bacterium peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus is novel in the group of enzymes deaminating 2-hydroxyamino acids in that it is an iron-sulfur protein and lacks pyridoxal phosphate [grabowski, r. and buckel, w. (1991) eur. j. biochem. 199, 89-94]. it was proposed that this type of l-serine dehydratase is widespread among bacteria but  has escaped intensive characterization due to its oxygen lability. here, we present evidence that another gram-positive bacterium, clostridium propionicum, contains both an iron-sulfur-dependent l-serine dehydratase and a pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent l-threonine dehydratase. these findings support the notion that two independent mechanisms exist for the deamination of 2-hydroxyamino acids. l-threonine dehydratase was purified 400-fold to apparent homogeneity and revealed as being a tetramer of identical subunits (m = 39 kda).  the purified enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 5 mu kat/mg protein and a km for l-threonine of 7.7 mm. l-serine (km = 380 mm) was also deaminated, the v/km ratio, however, being 118-fold lower than the one for l-threonine. l-threonine dehydratase was inactivated by borohydride, hydroxylamine and phenylhydrazine, all known inactivators of pyridoxal-phosphate-containing enzymes. incubation with nab3h4 specifically labelled the enzyme. activity of the phenylhydrazine-inactivated enzyme could be restored by pyridoxal phosphate. l-serine dehydratase was also purified 400-fold, but its extreme instability did  not permit purification to homogeneity. the enzyme was specific for l-serine (km  = 5 mm) and was inhibited by l-cysteine (ki = 0.5 mm) and d-serine (ki = 8 mm). activity was insensitive towards borohydride, hydroxylamine and phenylhydrazine but was rapidly lost upon exposure to air. fe2+ specifically reactivated the enzyme. l-serine dehydratase was composed of two different subunits (alpha, m = 30 kda; beta, m = 26 kda), their apparent molecular masses being similar to the ones of the two subunits of the iron-sulfur-dependent enzyme from p. asaccharolyticus. moreover, the n-terminal sequences of the small subunits from these two organisms were found to be 47% identical. in addition, 38% identity with the n-terminus of one of the two l-serine dehydratases of escherichia coli was detected.

TI  == intrapleural streptokinase in experimental empyema.
AB  == intrapleural streptokinase has been used in multiloculated empyemas to enhance pleural space drainage, presumably by causing fibrinolysis of the interlocular septae. we evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily administration of 10,000 u  intrapleural streptokinase or equal volumes of saline to enhance resolution of experimental empyema in the rabbit pleural space. seventy-two hours after intrapleural turpentine, 10(8) colony-forming units each of escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides fragilis were injected into the sterile pleural effusion of all animals. immediately after bacterial inoculation, and daily for 3 days, animals received 10,000 u streptokinase or saline intrapleurally. animals that achieved a pleural fluid ph < 7.30 and either glucose < 50 mg/dl or ldh > 500 iu/l were included for data analysis. at day 4 after bacterial inoculation, the streptokinase-treated empyemic rabbits had more  pleural fluid (18.8 +/- 5.1 ml) (mean +/- sem) than did saline-treated control animals (4.8 +/- 1.7 ml) (p = 0.015), fewer interpleural adhesions (8.2 +/- 2.7)  than did saline-treated control animals (25.1 +/- 3.6) (p = 0.002), and comparable amounts of visceral and parietal pleural plaque than did saline-treated control animals (p = ns). no evidence of systemic fibrinolysis was observed at 1 h after intrapleural streptokinase administration. we conclude that intrapleural streptokinase decreases interpleural adhesion numbers but fails to reduce the amount of pleural plaque observed in experimental empyema in rabbits.  the increases in pleural fluid volume observed after streptokinase administration may be due to mechanisms other than fibrinolytic activity.

TI  == [studies on the locality and the function of spirosome in bacterial cells: relationship between the production of spirosome and anaerobic glycolysis].
AB  == the locality and the function of spirosome were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and electron microscopy in  peptostreptococcus productus, clostridium sp. hd-17, lactobacillus fermentum, eubacterium aerofaciens and escherichia cali b. when the bacterial cells in phosphate buffered saline were disrupted by sonication and fractionated by differential centrifugation, the spirosome protein was found in the cytoplasmic fraction and not in the fraction of cell wall and cell membrane (the envelope fraction). the spirosome protein was found, however, in the envelope fraction when the bacterial cells were treated with a proper concentration of sds. the spirosome protein in the envelope fraction disappeared after treatment with 2% triton x-100 for 2 h. these results suggest that the spirosome protein anchored to the cell membrane upon sds treatment. so it is presumed that the locality of spirosome is close to the cell membrane. spirosome production increased in parallel to the concentration of glucose in the medium in obligate and aerotolerant anaerobes as well as in facultative anaerobes. this result indicates that the spirosome production was induced during the process of anaerobic glycolysis. fructose as the sole carbon source in the minimal medium induced the  spirosome production by e. coli as did glucose, but sodium pyruvate did not induce it either under aerobic or anaerobic condition.

TI  == bacterial and fungal contamination of human fetal liver collected transvaginally  for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
AB  == transplantation of fetal hematopoietic stem cells is a new therapy for fetuses diagnosed in utero with inherited disorders. however, prior to transplantation of fetal stem cells, the cells must be free of microbial contamination. in order to  investigate the contamination of human fetal liver tissue, we determined the rate and types of bacterial and fungal contamination of human fetal liver tissue collected transvaginally for use in stem cell transplantation by using the us pharmacopoiea assay. we found a high rate of contamination with bacteria or fungi (12 of the 14 fetal livers, or 85%). non-fermenting gram-negative rods were the predominant contaminants. the high rate of microbial contamination of fetal tissue suggests that techniques for tissue collection need to be improved before  fetal stem cells are used for clinical transplantation.

TI  == protein lg: a hybrid molecule with unique immunoglobulin binding properties.
AB  == immunoglobulin (ig)-binding bacterial proteins have attracted theoretical interest for their role in molecular host-parasite interactions, and they are widely used as tools in immunology, biochemistry, medicine, and biotechnology. protein l of the anaerobic bacterial species peptostreptococcus magnus binds ig light chains, whereas streptococcal protein g has affinity for the constant (fc)  region of igg. in this report, ig binding parts of protein l and protein g were combined to form a hybrid molecule, protein lg, which was found to bind a large majority of intact human igs as well as fc and fab fragments, and ig light chains. binding to ig was specific, and the affinity constants of the reactions between protein lg and human igg, iggfc fragments, and kappa light chains, determined by scatchard plots, were 5.9 x 10(9), 2.2 x 10(9), and 2.0 x 10(9) m-1, respectively. the binding properties of protein lg were more complete as compared with previously described ig-binding proteins when also tested against mouse and rat igs. this hybrid protein thus represents a powerful tool for the binding, detection, and purification of antibodies and antibody fragments.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == the gene for protein l, an immunoglobulin (ig) light chain-binding protein expressed by some strains of the anaerobic bacterial species peptostreptococcus magnus, was cloned and sequenced. the gene translates into a protein of 719 amino acid residues. following a signal sequence of 18 amino acids and a nh2-terminal region ("a") of 79 residues, the molecule contains five homologous "b" repeats of 72-76 amino acids each. further, toward the cooh terminus, two additional repeats ("c") were found. these are not related to the "b" repeats, but are highly homologous to each other. after the c repeats (52 amino acids each), a hydrophilic, proline-rich putative cell wall-spanning region ("w") was found, followed at the cooh-terminal end by a hydrophobic membrane anchor ("m"). fragments of the gene were expressed, and the corresponding peptides were analyzed for ig-binding activity. the b repeats were found to be responsible for  the interaction with ig light chains. an escherichia coli high level expression system was adapted for the production of large amounts of two ig-binding protein  l fragments comprising one and four b repeats, respectively.

TI  == the relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  == lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. the role of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of h2o2-positive and h2o2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. compared with women with h2o2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized  by h2o2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and  viridans streptococci (p less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). in addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with h2o2-positive lactobacilli to have chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than .05 for each comparison). vaginal colonization by group b streptococci or escherichia coli was not related to the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli. these data suggest that the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.

TI  == the effect of amoxycillin on vaginal colonization resistance and normal vaginal flora in monkeys.
AB  == previous studies have shown that vaginal colonization resistance in monkeys can be eliminated by amoxycillin and restored by flushing vaginal flora from a healthy monkey into the vagina of a monkey colonized with escherichia coli. the hypothesis that the effect of amoxycillin resulted from elimination of parts of the normal flora was tested in the present study. nine monkeys were flushed vaginally with amoxycillin daily for six days. the number of anaerobic bacteria decreased during amoxycillin administration, as did the number of species isolated. the most obvious effects were observed among the genera bacteroides and peptostreptococcus, while lactobacillus spp. were less affected. restoration of the flora after amoxycillin administration was slow in most of the monkeys. during amoxycillin administration, all monkeys became colonized spontaneously with e. coli. this was not, however, associated with increased adherence in vitro. the colonization persisted throughout the study period (29 days). it was concluded that amoxycillin disturbs vaginal colonization resistance by eliminating at least part of the normal vaginal flora, thereby promoting periurethral colonization with enterobacteria.

AB  == sterile pleural effusion was induced by intrapleural administration of turpentine, and empyema was induced by direct intrapleural inoculation of bacteria in rabbits. experimental models of anaerobic thoracic empyema were successfully made in this study, using escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, bacteroides fragilis, using the following methods; (1) a single bacterium inoculation of, a) e. coli, b) p. asaccharolyticus, c) b. fragilis, (2) simultaneous inoculations with an aerobe and an anaerobe, a) e. coli + p. asaccharolyticus, b) e. coli + b. fragilis. (3) an anaerobic inoculation 5 days after an aerobic inoculation, a) p. asaccharolyticus inoculation 5 days after e.  coli inoculation, b) b. fragilis inoculation 5 days after e. coli inoculation. the developments of several parameters (sialic acid levels, glucose levels, oxidation-reduction potential levels, bacterial counts and wbc counts in the pleural fluid and so on) were measured in each group. there was little difference of the rate of incidence of empyema between each group. empyema was highly induced even by a single anaerobe inoculation. the following tendencies were observed in development of parameters: (1) sialic acid levels and oxidation-reduction potential levels were decreased only in the conditions being  associated by b. fragilis infections. (2) in mixed infections of e. coli and anaerobes, bacterial counts of e. coli increased in number in the late phases of  the infections probably by the influences of anaerobes. the experiments of groups (2) and (3) were designed for demonstrations of biphasic infections between aerobes and anaerobes, but it turned out that quite unexpected results were seen  in these models.

TI  == the partial amino acid sequence of the nad(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of clostridium symbiosum: implications for the evolution and structural basis of  coenzyme specificity.
AB  == the amino acid sequence is reported for cnbr and tryptic peptide fragments of the nad(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of clostridium symbiosum. together with  the n-terminal sequence, these make up about 75% of the total sequence. the sequence shows extensive similarity with that of the nadp(+)-dependent glutamate  dehydrogenase of escherichia coli (52% identical residues out of the 332 compared) allowing confident placing of the peptide fragments within the overall  sequence. this demonstrated sequence similarity with the e. coli enzyme, despite  different coenzyme specificity, is much greater than the similarity (31% identities) between the gdh's of c. symbiosum and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, both nad(+)-linked. the evolutionary implications are discussed. in the 'fingerprint' region of the nucleotide binding fold the sequence gly x gly x x ala is found, rather than gly x gly x x gly. the sequence  found here has previously been associated with nadp+ specificity and its finding  in a strictly nad(+)-dependent enzyme requires closer examination of the function of this structural motif.

TI  == microbiologic causes and neonatal outcomes associated with chorioamnion infection.
AB  == chorioamnion infection is associated with histologic chorioamnionitis and prematurity, but the specific chorioamnion microorganisms associated with histologic chorioamnionitis, prematurity, and poor neonatal outcome have not been identified. bacteria were recovered from the chorioamnion cultures of 32% of 112  placentas delivered at less than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation and from 19% of  156 placentas delivered at greater than 34 weeks' gestation (odds ratio 2.1; 95%  confidence interval 1.1 to 3.8). chorioamnion bacteria most highly related to both prematurity and histologic chorioamnionitis were group b streptococcus and fusobacterium species. chorioamnion infection with peptostreptococcus was significantly related only to preterm delivery, and infection with escherichia coli, bacteroides, and ureaplasma were significantly related to histologic chorioamnionitis. among preterm infants, isolation of bacteria from the chorioamnion was related to an increased risk of neonatal death (rate ratio 3.8;  95% confidence interval 1.4 to 11.6). bacterial infection of the chorioamnion is  related to preterm birth, histologic chorioamnionitis, and neonatal death.

TI  == selection, expression, and nucleotide sequencing of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene of peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus.
AB  == the gene for the catabolic nad-linked glutamate dehydrogenase of peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus was cloned by selection of escherichia coli for complementation of a biosynthetic defect. cloned fragments containing the gene and the p. asaccharolyticus transcription and translation signals are very highly expressed in e. coli. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene was determined. it codes for a polypeptide of 421 amino acids, the sequence of which  is similar to those of the nadp-accepting glutamate dehydrogenases. the sequence  similarity of this protein to the mammalian glutamate dehydrogenases, which accept both nadp and nad, is greater than its similarity to the bacterial nadp-specific dehydrogenases, suggesting that this nad-specific bacterial glutamate dehydrogenase and the nadp-specific bacterial dehydrogenases diverged separately from the line leading to the dual-specificity mammalian glutamate dehydrogenases.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == the bacteriology of gangrenous and perforated appendicitis--revisited.
AB  == by using optimum sampling, transport, and culture techniques in patients with gangrenous or perforated appendicitis, we recovered than has previously been reported. thirty patients older than 12 years with histologically documented gangrenous or perforated appendicitis had peritoneal fluid, appendiceal tissue, and abscess contents (if present) cultured. appendiceal tissue was obtained so as to exclude the lumen. a total of 223 anaerobes and 82 aerobic or faculatative bacteria were recovered, an average of 10.2 different organisms per specimen. twenty-one different genera and more than 40 species were encountered. bacteroides fragilis group and escherichia coli were isolated from almost all specimens. within the b. fragilis group, eight species were represented. other frequent isolates included peptostreptococcus (80%), pseudomonas (40% [p. aeruginosa, 23.3%, other pseudomonas spp., 16.7%]), b. splanchnicus (40%), b. intermedius (36.7%), and lactobacillus (36.7%). interestingly a previously undescribed fastidious gram-negative anaerobic bacillus was isolated from nearly  one half of all patients. this organism was found to have low dna homology (by dot blot) with the known organisms most closely resembling it.

TI  == microbiology of infected epidermal cysts.
AB  == specimens from 231 epidermal cyst abscesses were inoculated on media supportive for growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. of these, 192 yielded bacterial growth. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 84 specimens (44%), anaerobic bacteria only in 57 specimens (30%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 51 specimens (26%). a total of 315 isolates (162 anaerobes  and 153 aerobes) were recovered. an average of 0.8 aerobic or facultative isolates per infected cyst were recovered, and this number was unrelated to the cysts' anatomic sites. however, the number of anaerobic bacteria varied; they were isolated more frequently in perirectal (1.5 isolates per specimen), vulvovaginal (1.4), and head (1.1) infections, and less frequently in trunk (0.7) and extremities (0.4) infections. the predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (81 isolates), group a streptococcus (9 isolates), and escherichia coli (7 isolates). the predominant anaerobic organisms were peptostreptococcus species (85 isolates) and bacteroides species (55 isolates, including 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus and 9 bacteroides fragilis groups). the  study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cyst abscesses in the perirectal, vulvovaginal, and head areas.

TI  == colony counts and characterization of bacteria adherent to the rumen wall and desquamated epithelial cells in conventional young lambs.
AB  == characterization and enumeration of the adherent epimural community of the rumen  wall of young, conventionally reared lambs were carried out from 2 to 21 days after birth. three hundred strains were isolated by anaerobic procedures from three sites: dorsal, ventral, and caudal sacs, and from the sloughed epithelial cells. the population of epimural bacteria was very dense from the first days of  the lamb's life. this population increased slightly with age. during the first week the counts were similar in the dorsal and ventral sacs, but they were 10 to  100 times lower in the caudal sac. total counts for anaerobic bacteria were higher than the counts for aerobic bacteria. the isolated strains were distributed into 19 groups: 11 groups included aerotolerant strains, and 8 others, strictly anaerobic strains. during the first week the facultative microflora was mainly composed of escherichia coli and streptococci. later, the epimural community was more complex and included staphyloccus, micrococcus, and gaffkya. the strictly anaerobic microflora was mainly composed of clostridium, peptostreptococcus, veillonella, propionibacterium, and acidaminococcus. some of  these strains appeared to be similar to those previously isolated from the rumen  fluid of young lambs; however, the genera micrococcus, veillonella, gaffkya, and  acidaminococcus, and e. coli seemed to be specific of the rumen wall tissues.

TI  == bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  == six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in  sterile saline (five patients). the mixture led to a prompt loss of cl difficile  and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by bacteroides sp, which  had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. strains of escherichia coli, cl bifermentans, and peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the finding that bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was  present after recovery suggests that the absence of bacteroides sp may result in  chronic relapsing cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by cl difficile.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == chemotaxis inhibition by gardnerella vaginalis and succinate producing vaginal anaerobes: composition of vaginal discharge associated with g vaginalis.
AB  == the influence of six succinate producing vaginal anaerobes and gardnerella vaginalis on the chemotactic activity of granulocytes was studied by the under agarose method. g vaginalis, mobiluncus species, and three gram negative anaerobes elicited hardly any response, but peptostreptococcus productus showed clear positive chemotaxis, as did the escherichia coli strain used as a control.  inhibition of the chemotactic response of white blood cells was found with all strains, but the high succinate producers from the genus bacteroides showed the most pronounced effect. the inhibition of chemotaxis by succinate producing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of non-specific vaginitis (nsv) is postulated, and  b ureolyticus or mobiluncus spp, rather than g vaginalis, are suggested as possible causes of nsv.

TI  == coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. iii. microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  == the coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. all microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. the mic90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine  are as follows: staphylococcus aureus 1.0, streptococcus pyogenes 8, enterobacteriaceae 2.0, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli 1, legionella pneumophila 8, haemophilus influenzae 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some peptostreptococcus strains. the aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, p. aeruginosa bmh 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (mic 0.2 micrograms/ml). coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for s.  aureus. the viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the mic (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. the frequency of resistance development was less than 1 x 10(-9) for escherichia coli and s. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the mic. the cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of  coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. coumamidine is stable in serum. in mouse protection tests against s. aureus nctc 10649 the ed50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. the antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.

TI  == controlled evaluation of modified radiometric blood culture medium supplemented with gelatin for detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  == although the addition of 1.2% gelatin to broth blood culture media containing sodium polyanetholesulfonate has been shown to enhance detection of certain bacteria, including neisseria meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis, the effect of such supplementation on the  detection of other microorganisms causing bacteremia and fungemia is not known. therefore, we studied bactec 6b medium with and without gelatin in 6,833 paired comparisons to examine the effects of supplementation on both the yield and the speed of detection of sepsis. more aerobic and facultative bacteria grew in the 6b than in the 6b-gelatin medium (p less than 0.001), especially staphylococci (p less than 0.01), escherichia coli (p less than 0.01), other members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.05), and acinetobacter spp. (p less than 0.05). when microorganisms grew in both bottles, they did so earlier in 6b than in 6b-gelatin (p less than 0.001). we conclude that the 6b medium in its present formulation is superior to 6b medium supplemented with 1.2% gelatin.

TI  == effect of high-fiber and high-oil diets on the fecal flora of swine.
AB  == six pairs of pigs were fed a basal diet, a high-fiber diet, and a diet high in corn oil in different sequences to minimize the carry-over effect of diet. after  2 months on each diet, a fecal specimen from each pig was cultured on nonselective medium in roll tubes. fifty colonies were randomly selected from each fecal sample, and isolates were characterized to identify a representative cross section of the fecal flora. the bacterial composition of the fecal flora differed between basal and high-fiber diets (p = 0.002) and between high-fiber and high-oil diets (p = 0.015). however, the floras were not significantly different between the basal and the high-oil diets (p = 0.135), nor were the floras of the 12 individual pigs (each on all three diets) statistically different (p = 0.103). only 14 of the 160 observed taxa have been detected in the human fecal flora, and only 159 of 1,871 total isolates (8.5%) were members of described species. the most common isolate was a streptococcus species similar to that reported by robinson et al. (i. m. robinson, s. c. whipp, j. a. bucklin, and m. j. allison, appl. environ. microbiol. 48:964-969, 1984), which was found in 34 of 36 samples and which represented 27.5% of all isolates. lactobacillus, fusobacterium, eubacterium, bacteroides, and peptostreptococcus species were the  next most common bacteria. escherichia coli represented 1.7% of all fecal isolates, which is somewhat higher than the 0.1 to 0.6% observed in human feces cultured similarly with prereduced anaerobically sterilized media.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin in the treatment of soft tissue pelvic infections.
AB  == the clinical efficacy and safety of ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin were evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. there were 33  cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). the most frequent isolates were bacteroides sp., 54;  bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented bacteroides, 12; bacteroides disiens, 11; fusobacterium, 13; peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; gardnerella vaginalis, 29; neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and escherichia  coli, five. clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. one treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. the cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. the third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. no adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.

TI  == the significance of clostridial isolates in intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  == in order to evaluate the significance of clostridial species in intra-abdominal infections, the bacteriology records of three hospitals were reviewed during a period of five years. included in this report were 41 patients from whom clostridial species were recovered from specimens of free peritoneal fluid, abscess cavities or bile. seven patients died for a mortality rate of 17.1 per cent. most patients had polymicrobial infections of which clostridial organisms were one of the several anaerobes isolated. clostridium perfringens was the single most frequently noted species, identified in 23 of the patients, but it was not associated with a different mortality rate than was observed for the other clostridial species. clostridial bacteremia was uncommon and demonstrated in only one patient. the mean age of the patients was 56.4 years; 56.2 for males  and 56.8 for females. neither age nor sex of the patient influenced the likelihood of survival. the source of the clostridial isolates--bile, abscess cavity or free peritoneal fluid--had no effect upon the outcome. several underlying conditions were responsible for the intraperitoneal clostridial organisms identified in this series. only mesenteric infarction proved significantly predictive of a fatal result. antibiotic coverage specifically directed against clostridia did not influence survival.

AB  == adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (mk0787/mk0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. major pathogens isolated included staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, streptococcus pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus species. satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. no major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. the results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == effect of aspoxicillin on anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == aspoxicillin (aspc), a semisynthetic penicillin has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. its in vitro antibacterial activity was less than those of cefoxitin against peptostreptococcus and veillonella, but was significantly high against bacteroides fragilis, one of the most clinically important anaerobe. the therapeutic and/or protective effect of aspc in experimental subcutaneous abscess or experimental intraabdominal mixed infection due to beta-lactamase producing b. fragilis and non-producing escherichia coli were much stronger than those of ticarcillin. in order to account the superiority of aspc in vivo, the effects of  aspc and other beta-lactams on b. fragilis were compared and the results were analyzed in relation to their in vitro bactericidal activities, stability against the beta-lactamase, binding properties with penicillin-binding proteins and pharmacokinetic properties. interestingly, administration of aspc did not increase the bacterial counts of clostridium difficile in caecal contents, but piperacillin, ticalcillin, carbenicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime increased the counts.

AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

AB  == to investigate the modifying role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens in vivo, we subjected bile from fischer rats treated per os  with chemical carcinogens and related compounds to a mutagenicity assay in the presence and absence of a cell-free extract from human feces. a mixture of the bile sample and potassium phosphate buffer was incubated in the presence or absence of human cell-free fecal extract and then further incubated with a bacterial suspension of salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta98 or ta100. bile from rats treated with 1-nitropyrene (1-np) produced about 2700 and 400 revertants per plate in strain ta98 in the presence and absence of the fecal extract, respectively. there was a drug dose- and bile volume-related response. treatment of 1-np-bile with beta-glucuronidase, but not aryl sulfatase, enhanced  its mutagenicity. cell-free extracts of some strains of intestinal bacteria (bacteroides fragilis atcc 12044, b. vulgatus atcc 8482, b. thetaiotaomicron atcc 12290, bacteroides sp. strain 524, eubacterium eligens vpi c15-48, peptostreptococcus sp. strain 204 and escherichia coli a-5-18) also enhanced the  mutagenicity of 1-np-bile. these bacterial cell-free extracts hydrolyzed the synthetic beta-d-glucuronides of phenolphthalein and/or p-nitrophenol. these data indicate that the glucuronide(s) of 1-np-metabolite(s) secreted into bile can be  hydrolyzed in the intestine by bacterial beta-glucuronidases to potent mutagenic  aglycone(s).

TI  == anaerobes: a new aetiology in cavitary pneumoconiosis.
AB  == the role of mycobacteria in the cavitation of large pneumoconiotic masses is well established. in other cases softness is attributed to an ischaemic or aseptic necrosis. five cases are described in which cavitation of the pulmonary masses was caused by anaerobic bacteria, confirmed by the growth of such bacterial in cultures after transtracheal or transpleural puncture. repeated cultures for mycobacteria gave negative results. two cases were acute, having serious complications such as bronchopleural fistula, empyema, and serious respiratory insufficiency. the role of anaerobes in cavitary pneumoconiosis has not been recognised previously, probably because of the special conditions required to culture these bacteria and the infrequent use of transtracheal puncture in the diagnosis of this entity. the prevalence of anaerobes as agents capable of cavitating pneumoconiotic masses remains to be established.

AB  == bacteriologic cultures of the vagina and the cervix of 38 praepubertal children,  aged 3 months to 16 years (average age 9 years) from the outpatient department for infants and juveniles of the 1st department of obstetrics and gynecology of the university of vienna were obtained vaginascopically using anaerobic transportmedia (port a cul) and were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. an average of 5.3 species was also isolated per child (2.9 aerobic and 2.5 anaerobic species). the commonest anaerobes were peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, bact. melaninogenicus, proprionibacterium and veillonella parvula, the prevalent  aerobes, were enterococci, e coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that anaerobic bacteria amount a significant component of the flora of the lower genital-tract of healthy children, as well as of infants with vaginal discharge.

TI  == lactobacilli do not cause frequency and dysuria syndrome.
AB  == mid-stream specimens (msu) of urine were collected from 142 healthy women (pregnant and non-pregnant) and cultured for lactobacilli and other fastidious bacteria. the latter either require co2 or are obligate anaerobes. lactobacilli were present in counts of 10(4)/ml or more in 34.8% of the women, and in counts of 10(5)/ml or more in 20.2%. besides lactobacilli, which were the bacteria most  frequently isolated, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptococci and peptostreptococci) were often found. this flora is typical of that of the lower vagina, and none of these women had either symptoms of urinary infection of pyuria. therefore, the bacteria isolated were commensals or contaminants. cultures of msus taken from 26 women with symptoms of dysuria and/or frequency, but without significant numbers of conventional pathogens such as escherichia coli, contained commensals and contaminants of the same variety and in similar numbers. urine samples from 50% of these patients contained at least 10(4) lactobacilli/ml and 27% had 10(5) or more/ml. lactobacilli were absent from the suprapubic urine specimens cultured from a further 44 women. there was no significant difference between the isolation rate of lactobacilli in urine cultures from healthy women and the rate in women with dysuria and frequency.

TI  == premature labor. ii. bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  == human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase a2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. the striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase a2 activity. activity was found in bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus a and b, escherichia coli, klebsiella, staphylococcus epidermidis, pneumococcus, lactobacillus, and mycoplasma hominis.  bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and s viridans had the highest activities. the specific activities of phospholipase a2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase a2 of the amnion and chorion. we postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase a2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.

TI  == bacterial interference between clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  == clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. it is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by c. difficile. the inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against c. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of c. difficile, with lactobacillus organisms and group d enterococci displaying  the most antagonistic activity. c. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. all eight strains of c. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera bacteroides, peptococcus, and peptostreptococcus.

AB  == nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in zaria have been identified. the work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. the isolates in order of prevalence were: candida albicans (20.9%), klebsiella sp (15.0%), escherichia coli (9.1%), streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), streptococcus viridans (2.1%), staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), proteus mirabilis (1.1%), peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus sp, lactobacillus sp, and clostridium sp were sought but not found. chlamydia, viruses, and t-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. it appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. for this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.

AB  == because puerperal sepsis is the second most common cause of maternal death in papua new guinea some aspects of its aetiology and prevention have been investigated. 91% of 125 women with puerperal fever were found to have post-partum uterine infection. the anaerobes bacteroides and peptostreptococcus singly or together, were the commonest causes, while streptococcus pyogenes was the predominant aerobic species. antibiotic sensitivity patterns were established, and chloramphenicol was found to be the most active agent against anaerobic and most aerobic strains. endocervical cultures obtained from 103 ante-partum and 50 afebrile post-partum women demonstrated all the species associated with post-partum genital infection in this study. an analysis of the records of all patients was made to determine the redisposing factors associated  with puerperal fever; only operative delivery was found to be significant, especially when it followed prolonged labour. metronidazole given to 72 women before induction of labour was associated with puerperal fever in 4%, compared with 21% in matched controls.

AB  == quantitative anaerobic culture of urine samples obtained from 593 pregnant women  by suprapubic bladder aspiration was performed to establish the involvement of anaerobic bacteria in asymptomatic urinary tract infections. the fluorescent antibody (fa) test was applied to the sediments of bladder aspirates to determine the site of infection. anaerobic bacteriuria (greater than or equal to 10(4) microorganisms/ml of urine) was found in 34 patients, of whom five were fa-positive. these anaerobes were identified as lactobacillus minutus, veillonella parvula (two patients). clostridium putrefaciens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. aerobic bacteriuria (greater than 10(4) microorganisms/ml of urine) was detected in 27 patients, of whom 13 were fa-positive. in 10 women with mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteriuria, no fa-positive bacteria were found. the finding of fa-positive anaerobes may indicate that these organisms are involved in silent renal infection.

AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

TI  == evaluation of bacteriological transport systems.
AB  == seven commercially manufactured bacteriological transport systems, including culturette, trans-cul (with stuart and amies), handiswab, securline (with amies and amies without charcoal) and culture caddy, were evaluated to determine whether these systems were capable of maintaining the viability and constant numbers of mixtures of hardy, fastidious and anaerobic organisms over 72 hours at 25c and 4c. the results of the study indicated that if specimens are maintained in transport systems at 25c they should be cultured at four hours to minimize loss of viability and to assure accurate quantitation. no one transport system excelled over the other for maintenance of cultures at room temperature. most organisms survived well in all of the transport systems for 72 hours when refrigerated.

TI  == puerperal endometritis: a prospective microbiologic study.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the flora in the endometrial cavity of two groups of puerperal patients: 47 afebrile control subjects and 27 with endometritis. a transcervical culturing technique designed to avoid cervical contamination and to preserve aerobes, anaerobes, and mycoplasma was employed, and bacterial colony counts were reported semiquantitatively. no difference was found in the flora of these two groups. furthermore, the most common pathogenic organisms (in decreasing order of frequency) were peptostreptococci, peptococci,  bacteroides sp., gamma-streptococci, enterococci, beta-streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and e. coli.

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == importance of the isovalerate carboxylation pathway of leucine biosynthesis in the rumen.
AB  == certain anaerobic ruminal bacteria synthesize the leucine carbon skeleton by use  of a pathway different from that described in other microorganisms. these organisms carboxylate the intact carbon skeleton of isovalerate, synthesizing leucine-2-c(14) from isovalerate-1-c(14). strains of bacteroides ruminicola and peptostreptococcus elsdenii were like ruminococcus flavefaciens in that they incorporated appreciable amounts of c(14) from isovalerate-1-c(14) into cellular  protein and in that the only labeled amino acid found was leucine. the specific activity of beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase in extracts from r. flavefaciens and from the mixed bacterial population from the rumen was very low as compared with the specific activity of this enzyme in extracts from escherichia coli. this suggests that the pathway of leucine biosynthesis that operates in many aerobic and facultative microorganisms is not the major pathway in rumen bacteria. this was supported by the finding that after fermentation of whole rumen contents with acetate-2-c(14), leucine from the bacterial cells had a specific activity lower than one would expect if acetate was incorporated directly into carbons 1 and 2 of leucine.

TI  == establishment of human indigenous bacteria in germ-free mice.
AB  == gibbons, r. j. (forsyth dental center and harvard school of dental medicine, boston, mass.), s. s. socransky, and b. kapsimalis. establishment of human indigenous bacteria in germ-free mice. j. bacteriol. 88:1316-1323. 1964.-thirteen strains of bacteria indigenous to the gingival crevice area of man were tested for their ability to establish as monocontaminants in germ-free mice. three facultative organisms, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus albus, and a "diphtheroid," established, as well as three anaerobes. fusobacterium fusiforme,  an anaerobic diphtheroid, and a bacteroides strain. seven other anaerobes (two strains of b. melaninogenicus, and one strain each of treponema microdentium, veillonella alcalescens, a peptostreptococcus strain, vibrio sputorum, and b. oralis) failed to establish. a mixture consisting of ten organisms representative of the predominant groups of cultivable bacteria present in the gingival crevice  area of man was inoculated intraorally into germ-free mice. all organisms with the exception of b. melaninogenicus and t. microdentium became established as polycontaminants. escherichia coli could be established in the above polycontaminated mice, as well as in those contaminated directly with human gingival debris. e. coli comprised approximately 50 and 6% of the fecal flora in  the two groups, respectively. diet, cecal contents, and feces of germ-free and polycontaminated mice were tested for inhibitory action against t. microdentium and b. melaninogenicus. none inhibited t. microdentium, whereas all three inhibited b. melaninogenicus. the inhibitory effect appeared to be due to dietary alfalfa. b. melaninogenicus could become established in mice monocontaminated with a facultative diptheroid and maintained on an alfalfa-free diet. these experiments indicate that human indigenous bacteria can become established in germ-free mice, and that microbial interactions and diet composition are important determinants.
