TI  == butyrylated starch intake can prevent red meat-induced o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine adducts in human rectal tissue: a randomised clinical trial.
AB  == epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (crc) risk with high red meat (hrm) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be protective. in the present study, we examined whether a hrm diet increased rectal o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (o6meg) adduct levels in healthy human subjects, and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (hamsb) was protective. a group of  twenty-three individuals consumed 300 g/d of cooked red meat without (hrm diet) or with 40 g/d of hamsb (hrm+hamsb diet) over 4-week periods separated by a 4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. stool and rectal biopsy samples were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. the hrm diet increased rectal o6meg adducts relative to its baseline by 21 % (p< 0.01), whereas the addition of hamsb to the hrm diet prevented this increase. epithelial proliferation increased with both the hrm (p< 0.001) and hrm+hamsb (p< 0.05) diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower following the hrm+hamsb diet compared with the hrm diet (p< 0.05). relative to its baseline, the hrm+hamsb diet increased the excretion of scfa by over 20 % (p< 0.05) and increased the absolute abundances of the clostridium coccoides group (p< 0.05), the clostridium leptum group (p< 0.05), lactobacillus spp. (p< 0.01),  parabacteroides distasonis (p< 0.001) and ruminococcus bromii (p< 0.05), but lowered ruminococcus torques (p< 0.05) and the proportions of ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus torques and escherichia coli (p< 0.01). hrm consumption could increase the risk of crc through increased formation of colorectal epithelial o6meg adducts. hamsb consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct formation, which may be associated with increased stool scfa levels and/or changes in the microbiota composition.

TI  == characterization of 1706, a virulent phage from lactococcus lactis with similarities to prophages from other firmicutes.
AB  == the virulent lactococcal phage 1706, isolated in 1995 from a failed cheese production in france, represents a new lactococcal phage species of the siphoviridae family. this phage has a burst size of 160 and a latent period of 85 min. its linear double-stranded dna genome was composed of 55,597 bp with a 33.7% g+c content. its deduced proteome (76 orfs) shared limited similarities to other  known phage proteins. sds-page coupled with lc-ms/ms analyses led to the identification of 15 structural proteins. the most striking feature of the 1706 proteome was that 22 orfs shared similarities with proteins deduced from the genome of either ruminococcus torques and/or clostridium leptum. both are firmicutes bacteria found in the gut flora of humans. we also identified a four-gene module in phage 1706, most likely involved in host recognition that shared similarities with lactococcal prophages. we propose that the virulent phage 1706 infected another bacterial genus before picking up a lactococcal host  recognition module.

TI  == assessment of microbial diversity in human colonic samples by 16s rdna sequence analysis.
AB  == abstract the bacterial species diversity of three colonic tissue samples from elderly people was investigated by sequence analysis of randomly cloned eubacterial 16s rdna. the majority of sequences (87%) clustered within three bacterial groups: (1) bacteroides; (2) low g+c content gram-positives related to  clostridium coccoides (cluster xiva); (3) gram-positives related to clostridium leptum (cluster iv). these groups have been shown to dominate the human faecal flora. only 25% of sequences were closely related (>97%) to current species type  strains, and 28% were less than 97% related to any database entry. 19% of sequences were most closely related to recently isolated butyrate-producing bacteria belonging to clusters xiva and iv, with a further 18% of the sequences most closely related to ruminococcus obeum and ruminococcus torques (members of cluster xiva). these results provide the first molecular information on the microbial diversity present in human colonic samples.
