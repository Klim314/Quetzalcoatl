effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
this study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/l), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/l; origanum oil, 0.50 g/l, and peppermint oil, 1 g/l), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/l) in vitro. methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. protozoa population decreased, but abundances of ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella bryantii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella ruminicola, clostridium aminophilum, and ruminobacter amylophilus increased with increasing doses of vanillin. origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. all the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, selenomonas ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola and p. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. the abundances of megasphaera elsdenii, c. aminophilum, and clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of b. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of s. ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola, and p. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). the results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.
inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline of the breakdown of peptides by rumen bacteria  and protozoa.
the rate of peptide breakdown in the rumen frequently exceeds the rate at which the amino acids released can be used for microbial growth. the final step in this often wasteful process involves the cleavage of dipeptides. the main rumen bacterial species with high dipeptidase activity, prevotella ruminicola, fibrobacter succinogenes, lachnospira multipara and megasphaera elsdenii, had activities which were inhibited > 95% by 1,10-phenanthroline, a chelator of divalent metal ions and metalloprotease inhibitor. dipeptidase activity in digesta taken from the rumen of sheep decreased by 33% in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline, while mixed bacteria from the same samples were inhibited by 80% and the activity of mixed protozoa decreased by only 15%. thus a substantial amount of dipeptide breakdown appears to be due to ciliate protozoa in the mixed population. extensive washing of the protozoa increased the sensitivity of protozoal dipeptidase activity to 1,10-phenanthroline, suggesting that protozoa too have a metallo-dipeptidase activity but that it is normally protected from inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline. breakdown of the pentapeptide, ala5, was also inhibited 27% by 1,10-phenanthroline in the mixed population, and when trypticase, a pancreatic casein hydrolysate containing a mixture of oligopeptides, dipeptides and amino acids, was incubated with rumen fluid, the production of ammonia and free amino groups was inhibited 71% by 1,10-phenanthroline. it was concluded that metal ion chelation inhibits oligopeptidase and dipeptidase activities of rumen micro-organisms and may be a means of controlling ammonia production from peptides in the rumen.
