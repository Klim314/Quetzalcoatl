TI  == potential use of bacillus thuringiensis bacteriocins to control antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with mastitis in dairy goats.
AB  == mastitis caused by microbial infections in dairy goats reduces milk yield, modifies milk composition, and potentially contributes to morbidity in herds and  consumers of dairy products. microorganisms associated with mastitis in dairy goats are commonly controlled with antibiotics, but it is known that continued use of these chemical agents promotes antibiotic resistance among bacterial populations. recently, it has been shown that bacteriocins of bacillus thuringiensis inhibit growth of food-borne pathogens and also bacteria associated with bovine mastitis. however, there is no report on their ability to inhibit microorganisms linked to mastitis in dairy goats. in this study, using 16s rdna and its regions of rdna, we identified nine bacterial isolates and an encapsulated yeast associated with mastitis in dairy goats. enterococcus durans,  brevibacillus sp., and staphylococcus epidermidis 2 were resistant to, respectively, 75, ~67, ~42, and ~42 % of the antibiotics screened. in addition, 60 % of the bacterial isolates were resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, vancomycin, and dicloxacillin. importantly, 60 % of the isolates were inhibited by the bacteriocins, but s. epidermidis 1, enterobacter sp., escherichia vulneris, and cryptococcus neoformans were not susceptible to these antimicrobial peptides. using brevibacillus sp. and staphylococcus chromogenes as indicator bacteria, we show that peptides of ~10 kda that correspond to the molecular mass  of bacteriocins used in this study are responsible for the inhibitory activity. our results demonstrate that multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria associated with subclinical mastitis in dairy goats from guanajuato, mexico, are susceptible to bacteriocins produced by b. thuringiensis.

TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == bacillus polymachus sp. nov., with a broad range of antibacterial activity, isolated from forest topsoil samples by using a modified culture method.
AB  == a new, modified culture method that utilizes a transwell plate with a 0.4 microm  pore-size microporous membrane was developed. this system allows only trace nutrients from the soil into the liquid culture through the microporous membrane. the method is a more powerful tool for the discovery of novel species from soils  than are traditional methods. such newly identified species could potentially produce useful metabolites. a bacterial strain, t515(t), was isolated using this  modified culture method. growth of strain t515(t) occurred at ph 4-9 in a temperature range between 20 degrees c and 40 degrees c and in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) nacl on r2a agar. colonies on the agar plates were tiny, white, and convex after 5 days incubation at 28 degrees c. comparative analysis of the nearly full-length 16s rrna gene sequence of strain t515(t) revealed close pairwise similarity with species of the genus bacillus, and strain t515(t) was most closely related to bacillus panaciterrae gsoil 1517(t) (96.7 %) and bacillus funiculus naf001(t) (96.0 %). the major quinone of strain t515(t) was menaquinone-7 (mk-7) and the major fatty acids were iso-c15 : 0 (45.5 %), anteiso-c15 : 0 (23.2 %) and c16 : 0 (10.9 %). the predominant polar lipids were  diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. strain t515(t) was sensitive to streptomycin and tetracycline, but resistant to rifampicin (0.125 microg ml(-1)), ampicillin (0.5 microg ml(-1)) and chloramphenicol (1 microg ml(-1)). the strain showed antimicrobial activities against the six strains tested: bacillus subtilis kemb 51201-001, staphylococcus  aureus kemb 4659, pseudomonas aeruginosa kacc 10185, staphylococcus epidermidis kacc 13234, paenibacillus larvae kacc 14031 and escherichia coli kemb 212-234. based on these results, strain t515(t) represents a novel species of the genus bacillus with the proposed name, bacillus polymachus sp. nov. the type strain is  t515(t) ( = kemb 9005-168(t) = kacc 18242(t) = nbrc 110614(t)).

TI  == bacterial constituents of indoor air in a high throughput building in the tropics.
AB  == airborne bacteria are significant biotic constituents of bioaerosol. bacteria at  high concentrations in the air can compromise indoor air quality (iaq) and result in many diseases. in tropical environments like malaysia that extensively utilize air-conditioning systems, this is particularly significant due to continuous recirculation of indoor air and the potential implications for human health. currently, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the impact of airborne bacteria on iaq in malaysia. this study was prompted by a need for reliable baseline data  on airborne bacteria in the indoor environment of tropical equatorial malaysia, that may be used as a reference for further investigations on the potential role  played by airborne bacteria as an agent of disease in this region. it was further necessitated due to the threat of bioterrorism with the potentiality of release of exotic pathogenic microorganisms into indoor or outdoor air. before scientists can detect the latter, a gauge of the common microorganisms in indoor (as well as outdoor) air needs to be ascertained, hence the expediency of this study. bacterial counts from the broad-based and targeted study were generally in the order of 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu) per m(3) of air. the most prevalent airborne bacteria found in the broad-based study that encompassed all five levels of the building were gram-positive cocci (67.73%), followed by gram-positive rods (24.26%) and gram-negative rods (7.10%). gram-negative cocci were rarely detected (0.71%). amongst the genera identified, kytococcus sp., micrococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., leifsonia sp., bacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. predominated in indoor air. the most dominant bacterial species were kytococcus sedentarius, staphylococcus epidermidis and micrococcus luteus. the opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen, stenotrophomonas maltophilia was also discovered at a high percentage in the cafeteria. the bacteria isolated in this study have been increasingly documented to cause opportunistic infections in immuno-compromised patients, sometimes with fatal outcomes. furthermore, some of them are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. hence, we propose that indoor reservoirs of these bacteria and their associated clinical and more subtle health effects, if any, be investigated further.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel lipopeptide from streptomyces amritsarensis sp. nov. active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == nowadays antimicrobial lipopeptides are being widely exploited for developing potential therapeutic agents for treating bacterial infections. in the present study, we have purified and characterized an antimicrobial lipopeptide produced by streptomyces amritsarensis sp. nov. (= mtcc 11845(t) = jcm 19660(t)). the lipopeptide was purified using silica gel chromatography, size exclusion chromatography and reverse phase- hplc. the ms/ms analysis of the lipopeptide revealed that it has amino acid sequence as ala-thr-gly-ser-his-gln and a long chain fatty acid tail with six times repeated the molecular mass of 161 da which  is corresponding to -c12h19. based on the molecular mass (878.5 da) and amino acid composition, the lipopeptide was identified as a novel lipopeptide. the mic  values of purified lipopeptide against bacillus subtilis (mtcc 619), staphylococcus epidermidis (mtcc 435), mycobacterium smegmatis (mtcc 6) and clinical strain, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were found to be 10, 15, 25 and 45 mug/ml, respectively. it was completely stable at 70 degrees c for 1 h and retained 81.8% activity after autoclaving (121 degrees c for 15 min). it did not show any change in its activity profile between ph 5.0 - 9.0 and is stable to trypsin, proteinase k and lipase enzymes. it was found to be non-mutagenic against salmonella typhimurium (ta98) and did not show cytotoxicity when checked against chinese hamster ovary (cho) cell line. in addition to antibacterial activity it also exhibits biosurfactant activity.

TI  == [microbiological study of infectious endophthalmitis with positive culture within a 13 year-period].
AB  == introduction: our objectives are to describe the microbial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis. material and methods: retrospective study of patients with microbiological diagnosis of endophthalmitis treated at the ophthalmology department of the general hospital la mancha centro in the period 1996-2008. the  identification of isolates was performed using the automated vitek-2(r) and api galleries (biomerieux, spain sa). the antimicrobial susceptibility was performed  by the vitek-2(r) system (biomerieux, spain sa), e-test strips (mic test strip, liofilchem, italy) and sensititre(r) yeastone trading system (trek diagnostic systems, ohio, usa) for candida species. results: forty four (70%) of 63 cases of endophthalmitis were culture positive. gram-positive bacteria were much more common than gram-negative bacteria in both postoperative endophthalmitis (poe) and post-traumatic endophthalmitis (pte). staphylococcus epidermidis was predominant in poe, while bacillus sp. predominated in the pte; furthermore, the  75% of total fungal isolates corresponded to postraumatic cases. the isolated strains showed 100% susceptibility to vancomycin, ceftazidime and amikacin, while resistance to ciprofloxacin was greater than 15%. the empirical antifungal therapy failed in 50% of cases. the visual prognosis was significantly less favorable in the pte. conclusions: based on the susceptibility of our isolates, vancomycin, ceftazidime and amikacin are good choices for empirical treatment of  endophthalmitis, unlike ciprofloxacin. we recommend conducting antifungal prophylaxis after penetrating ocular trauma in a rural environment.

TI  == spiromastixones a-o, antibacterial chlorodepsidones from a deep-sea-derived spiromastix sp. fungus.
AB  == fifteen new depsidone-based analogues named spiromastixones a-o (1-15) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep-sea spiromastix sp. fungus. their  structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive nmr and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. spiromastixones a-o are classified into two subtypes based on the orientation of ring c relative to ring  a, while the n-propyl substituents on rings a and c are rarely seen in natural products. most analogues are substituted by various numbers of chlorine atoms. all compounds exhibited significant inhibition against gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and bacillus subtilis with mic values ranging from 0.125 to 8.0 mug/ml. in addition, compounds 6-10 displayed potent inhibitory effects against methicillin-resistant bacterial strains of s. aureus (mrsa) and s. epidermidis (mrse), while 10 also inhibited the growth of the vancomycin-resistant bacteria enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (vre). the structure-activity relationships are discussed.

TI  == impact of donor arm cleaning with different aseptic solutions for prevention of contamination in blood bags.
AB  == transfusion associated sepsis cases are encountered occasionally and bacterial transmission remains the major cause. the goal of our study was to compare the efficacy of disinfectants in phlebotomy site preparation. after selection of donor the antecubital fossa area of the arm was disinfected with different types  of disinfectants namely sprit (70% isopropyl alcohol), povidone iodine (0.5% w/v  available iodine in distilled water), savlon (1.5% v/v chlorhexidine gluconate solution and 3.0% cetrimide solution) and combination of sprit and povidone iodine. swabs were collected from 20 donors using a sterile forceps, after cleaning with different antiseptic solutions. swab was streaked on blood agar plate aseptically and the plate was incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. colonies  were counted and a single colony was re-cultured by growing on nutrient and mac-conkey agar. the biochemical characteristics were determined by performing gram staining, motility, catalase and oxidase tests. the mean values of colonies  were significantly higher with savlon compared to other three solutions. the difference was statistically significant by "t" test (t values 1.7-3.0; p < 0.05). staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp., micrococcus sp., bacillus megaterium and bacillus cereus were the organisms identified. after completion of bleeding, samples from the bag were aseptically inoculated in aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles to be tested on bact/alert system. the bag containing donor's blood did not show any contamination when three cleanings were carried out using sprit, povidone iodine and spirit respectively.

TI  == cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe): a new antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant cyclic dipeptide from bacillus sp. n strain associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode.
AB  == a new microbial cyclic dipeptide (diketopiperazine), cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) was isolated for the first time from the ethyl acetate extract of fermented modified  nutrient broth of bacillus sp. n strain associated with rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode. antibacterial activity of the compound was determined  by minimum inhibitory concentration and agar disc diffusion method against medically important bacteria and the compound recorded significant antibacterial  against test bacteria. highest activity was recorded against staphylococcus epidermis (1 microg/ml) followed by proteus mirabilis (2 microg/ml). the activity of cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) against s. epidermis is better than chloramphenicol, the standard antibiotics. cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) recorded significant antitumor activity  against a549 cells (ic50 value: 10 mum) and this compound recorded no cytotoxicity against factor signaling normal fibroblast cells up to 100 mum. cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) induced significant morphological changes and dna fragmentation associated with apoptosis in a549 cells. acridine orange/ethidium bromide stained cells indicated apoptosis induction by cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe). flow cytometry analysis showed that the cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) did not induce cell cycle arrest. effector molecule of apoptosis such as caspase-3 was found activated in treated cells, suggesting apoptosis as the main mode of cell death. antioxidant activity was evaluated by free radical scavenging and reducing power activity, and the compound recorded significant antioxidant activity. the free radical scavenging activity of cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) is almost equal to that of butylated hydroxyanisole, the standard antioxidant agent. we also compared the biological activity of natural cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) with synthetic cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) and cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe). natural and synthetic cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) recorded similar pattern of activity. although synthetic cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe) recorded lower activity. but in the case of reducing power activity, synthetic cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe) recorded significant activity than natural and synthetic cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe). the results of the present study reveals that cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) is more bioactive than cyclo(l-tyr-l-phe). to the best of our  knowledge, this is the first time that cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) has been isolated from  microbial natural source and also the antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant  activity of cyclo(d-tyr-d-phe) is also reported for the first time.

TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == effects of a skin neuropeptide (substance p) on cutaneous microflora.
AB  == background: skin is the largest human neuroendocrine organ and hosts the second most numerous microbial population but the interaction of skin neuropeptides with the microflora has never been investigated. we studied the effect of substance p  (sp), a peptide released by nerve endings in the skin on bacterial virulence. methodology/principal findings: bacillus cereus, a member of the skin transient microflora, was used as a model. exposure to sp strongly stimulated the cytotoxicity of b. cereus (+553+/-3% with sp 10(-6) m) and this effect was rapid  (<5 min). infection of keratinocytes with sp treated b. cereus led to a rise in caspase1 and morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton. secretome analysis revealed that sp stimulated the release of collagenase and superoxide dismutase. moreover, we also noted a shift in the surface polarity of the bacteria linked to a peel-off of the s-layer and the release of s-layer proteins. meanwhile, the biofilm formation activity of b. cereus was increased. the thermo  unstable ribosomal elongation factor (ef-tu) was identified as the sp binding site in b. cereus. other gram positive skin bacteria, namely staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis also reacted to sp by an increase of virulence. thermal water from uriage-les-bains and an artificial polysaccharide (teflose(r)) were capable to antagonize the effect of sp on bacterial virulence.  conclusions/significance: sp is released in sweat during stress and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases through neurogenic inflammation. our study suggests that a direct effect of sp on the skin microbiote should be another mechanism.

TI  == cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  == the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h  nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

TI  == bacterial contamination of unused, disposable non-sterile gloves on a hospital orthopaedic ward.
AB  == background: non-sterile disposable gloves are used on large hospital wards, however their potential role as a vehicle for pathogen transmission has not been  explored in this setting. aims: this study investigates glove use on a hospital orthopaedic ward to examine whether pathogen contamination occurs prior to contact with patients. method: glove samples were aseptically removed from boxes  on a hospital orthopaedic ward on opening and days 3, 6 and 9 thereafter. following elution of bacteria and viable counts, glove isolates were identified by standard techniques and 16s rdna sequencing. methicillin resistance of staphylococci was determined by disc diffusion, epsilon tests and pcr. gloves were inoculated to determine two isolate survival rates. results: total bacterial counts ranged from 0 to 9.6 x 10(3) cfu/glove. environmental bacteria, particularly bacillus species, were present on 31/38 (81.6%) of samples. half (19/38) the samples were contaminated with skin commensals; coagulase negative staphylococci were predominant. enterococcus faecalis , klebsiella pneumoniae , pseudomonas sp. or methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus were recovered from 5/38 (13.2%) of samples. significantly more skin commensals and pathogens were recovered from samples from days 3, 6, 9 than box-opening samples. staphylococcus epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae inoculated onto gloves remained viable for several days but counts decreased. conclusion: health care workers introduced skin commensals and pathogenic bacteria into glove boxes indicating that unused, non-sterile gloves are potential pathogen transmission vehicles in hospitals. findings highlight adherence to handwashing guidelines, common glove retrieval practice, and glove-box design as targets for decreasing bacteria transmission via gloves on hospital wards.

TI  == nurses' uniforms: how many bacteria do they carry after one shift?
AB  == this pilot study investigated the pathogens that nurses are potentially bringing  into the public and their home when they wear work uniforms outside of the work environment. to achieve this, sterilized uniforms were distributed to 10 nurses at a local hospital in washington state at the beginning of their shift. worn uniforms were collected at the end of the shifts and sent to a laboratory for analysis. four tests were conducted: 1) a heterotrophic growth plate count, 2) methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) growth, 3) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), and 4) identification of the heterotrophic plate counts. each participant completed a questionnaire and a survey. the results showed that the average bacteria colony growth per square inch was 1,246 and 5,795 for day and night shift, respectively. after 48 h, mrsa  positives were present on 4 of the day shift and 3 of the night shift uniforms. additional bacteria identified include: bacillus sp., micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and micrococcus roseus. the significant presence of bacteria on the uniforms 48 h after the shift ended necessitates further study, discussions and policy consideration regarding wearing health care uniforms outside of the work environment.

TI  == [linezolid resistant staphylococcus epidermidis in a patient with a knee replacement].
AB  == staphylococcus epidermidis is the most prevalent species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns). it accounts for over 65% of all staphylococci isolated from  samples. in recent years the increasing relevance of cns as pathogens is evident, mainly causing bacteraemia and prosthetic device infection. linezolid, being an effective antibiotic against this pathogen, and due to its ease of use and oral posology, is becoming the treatment of choice in outpatients. however, the continued use of this drug is causing the development of resistant strains. we describe a prosthetic infection due to linezolid resistant s. epidermidis that appeared in a patient who had been previously treated with this drug for 16 days  due to the isolation of bacillus sp. this case was not related to a resistant strain hospital outbreak.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == nonrecovery of varying proportions of viable bacteria during spread plating governed by the extent of spreader usage and proposal for an alternate spotting-spreading approach to maximize the cfu.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the cause of high variations and inconsistencies in bacterial  cfu observed within and between different experiments while assessing viable bacterial counts through spread plating (sp). methods and results: following the  inconsistent results, cfu estimations were undertaken through conventional sp using the spreader, or a modified approach that did not use spreader employing four organisms. the latter approach involving spotting-and-tilt-spreading of inoculum on agar surface [spotting spreading (ss)] yielded higher cfu by 11-120%  over the weighted average depending on the organism and diluent. the adverse effect owing to the spreader was the most obvious in escherichia coli followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus pumilus. plate attributes that determined the surface moisture levels of agar medium and the spreading practice adopted by the personnel formed two other major influencing factors. plating for shorter periods (<60 s) using fresh 15/20 ml plates caused loss of 3-12% cfu owing to inoculum adhesion to spreader irrespective of glass or polypropylene make. on the other hand, prolonging the plating brought down the cfu significantly. spreader movement on agar surface subsequent to the exhaustion of free moisture, which was marked by the experiencing of some friction to smooth spreader movement, was detrimental to vegetative cells, while bacillus spores were less affected. conclusions: the study brings out that the way sp is carried  out exerts significant effects on cfu influenced by plate conditions. prolonged use of spreader on dry agar surface could be highly detrimental to bacterial cells. a mild use of spreader accounting for spreader-adhering inoculum or the practice of ss not involving the spreader is recommended. significance and impact of the study: this study unravels the effects owing to the spreader on bacterial  cells and the cfu and recommends an alternate approach of ss to minimize cfu inconsistencies and to maximize the viable bacterial counts.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial activities of two streptomyces isolates from soil in the periphery of universiti putra malaysia.
AB  == this study was to assess the identification and antimicrobial activities of two actinomycete isolates. the two isolates designated as b8 and c2, were isolated from a patch of soil in the peripheral area of universiti putra malaysia by streaking on starch casein agar after standard serial dilution procedures. their  antimicrobial activities were first evaluated against eight clinical laboratory strains namely bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, klebsiella sp.,  pseudomonas sp., salmonella sp., staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis by perpendicular streak method on mueller hinton and tryptic soy agar. in both media, a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was observed for both isolates, with b8 against all the test bacteria and c2 against five of them  (bacillus sp., e. coli, pseudomonas sp., s. aureus and s. epidermidis). re-assessment against e. coli atcc 25922 and s. aureus atcc 25923 strains by similar method showed antibacterial activities by isolate b8 against both attc strains while c2 only against s. aureus atcc 25923. streptomyces griseus atcc 10137 was included in the later experiment and showed antibacterial activity against both atcc strains. subsequently, the two isolates were identified by pcr/sequencing techniques and phylogenetic analysis to be streptomyces species (>93% homology based on 16s rrna and rpob genes). characterization on cultural characteristic and viable count at different temperatures (37 masculinec and 28 masculinec), on different microbiological media (aia, isp-2, mha, na, pda and tsa), were performed. more morphological features were observed on isp-2 for both isolates. a higher growth yield was also observed at 28 masculinec in all media but in comparing that between the two isolates, isolate b8 outnumbered c2 at all  experimental conditions. the observed variation in cultural traits and growth yield indicate unique properties between the two antibiotic-producing isolates.

TI  == expression of an organic solvent stable lipase from staphylococcus epidermidis at2.
AB  == an organic solvent tolerant lipase gene from staphylococcus epidermidis at2 was successfully cloned and expressed with ptrchis2 in e. coli top10. sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame (orf) of 1,933 bp in length which coded for a polypeptide of 643 amino acid residues. the polypeptide comprised of a signal peptide (37 amino acids), pro-peptide and a mature protein of 390 amino acids. expression of at2 lipase resulted in an 18-fold increase in activity, upon the induction of 0.6 mm iptg after a 10 h incubation period. interestingly, this  lipase was stable in various organic solvents (25% (v/v), mainly toluene, octanol, p-xylene and n-hexane). literature shows that most of the organic solvent stable bacterial lipases were produced by pseudomonas sp. and bacillus sp., but very few from staphylococcus sp. this lipase demonstrates great potential to be employed in various industrial applications.

TI  == a survey of veterinary hospitals in nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the sokoto metropolis of north-western nigeria. a total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: bacillus sp. (27.3%), staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), listeria sp. (13.6%), streptococcus sp. (11.4%), salmonella sp. (6.8%), escherichia coli (4.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), citrobacter sp. (2.3%), klebsiella sp. (2.3%), lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), micrococcus sp. (2.3%), pasteurella sp. (2.3%), proteus sp. (2.3%), and yersinia sp. (2.3%). a higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. in this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the sokoto region of north-western nigeria. of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in nigeria. it was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and  hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.

TI  == walkmycin b targets walk (yycg), a histidine kinase essential for bacterial cell  growth.
AB  == the walk (a histidine kinase)/walr (a response regulator, aka yycg/yycf) two-component system is indispensable in the signal transduction pathway for the  cell-wall metabolism of bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. the inhibitors directed against walk would be expected to have a bactericidal effect. after we screened 1368 culture broths of streptomyces sp. by a differential growth assay, walkmycin a, b and c, which were produced by strain mk632-100f11, were purified using silica-gel column chromatography and hplc. in this paper, the chemical structure of the major product (walkmycin b) was determined to be di-anthracenone (c(44)h(44)cl(2)o(14)), which was very similar to be40665a. mics  of walkmycin b against b. subtilis and s. aureus were 0.39 and 0.20 microg ml(-1), and ic(50) measurements against walk were 1.6 and 5.7 microm, respectively. to clarify the affinity between walk and walkmycin b, surface plasmon resonance was measured to obtain the equilibrium dissociation constant, k(d1), of 7.63 microm at the higher affinity site of b. subtilis walk. these results suggest that walkmycin b inhibits walk autophosphorylation by binding to  the walk cytoplasmic domain.

TI  == insight in to the phylogeny of polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis: horizontal gene transfer.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoates (phas) are gaining more and more importance the world over  due to their structural diversity and close analogy to plastics. their biodegradability makes them extremely desirable substitutes for synthetic plastics. phas are produced in organisms under certain stress conditions. here, we investigated 253 sequenced (completely and unfinished) genomes for the diversity and phylogenetics of the pha biosynthesis. discrepancies in the phylogenetic trees for phaa, phab and phac genes of the pha biosynthesis have led to the suggestion that horizontal gene transfer (hgt) may be a major contributor  for its evolution. twenty four organisms belonging to diverse taxa were found to  be involved in hgt. among these, bacillus cereus atcc 14579 and xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str. 306 seem to have acquired all the three genes through hgt events and have not been characterized so far as pha producers. this study also revealed certain potential organisms such as streptomyces coelicolor a3(2),  staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, brucella suis 1330, burkholderia sp., dsmz 9242 and leptospira interrogans serovar lai str. 56601, which can be transformed  into novel pha producers through recombinant dna technology.

AB  == mexican tarragon (tagetes lucida cv. asteraceae: campanulatae) is an important, nutritious plant and an effective herbal medicine. seven coumarins, 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (4), umbelliferone (7-hydroxycoumarin) (5), scoparone (6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) (7), esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) (11), 6-hydroxy-7-methoxycoumarin (12), herniarin (7-methoxycoumarin) (13), and scopoletin (6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin) (14), and three flavonoids, patuletin (18), quercetin (19), and quercetagetin (20), were isolated from ch2cl2 and meoh  extracts from aerial parts of t. lucida. in addition, 6,7-diacetoxy coumarin (15), 6-methoxy-7-acetylcoumarin (16), and 6-acetoxy-7-methoxycoumarin (17) derivatives were synthesized. 8-methoxypsoralen (1), 8-acetyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (2), 7,8-dihydroxy-6-meth-oxycoumarin (3), 6,7-dimethoxy-4-methylcoumarin (6), 5,7-dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (8), 4-hydroxycoumarin (9), 4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethylcoumarin (10), naringenin (21), glycoside-7-rhamnonaringin  (22), and rutin (23) were commercially obtained (sigma-aldrich). all of these compounds and extracts (m1 and m2) were assayed against bacteria and fungi. the antibacterial activity was determined on bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, salmonella sp., shigella boydii, shigella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans,  sarcina lutea, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterolitica, vibrio cholerae (three el tor strains, cdc-v12, clinic case, and indre-206, were obtained from contaminated water), and v. cholerae (no-o1). the evaluated fungi were aspergillus niger, penicillium notatum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium sporotrichum, rhizoctonia solani, and trichophyton mentagrophytes. the most active compounds against gram-positive and -negative bacteria were the dihydroxylated coumarins 3 and 4. in addition, 2-4, 6, 7, and 11 showed an interesting activity against v. cholerae, a key bacterium in the contaminated water; 2-4 were the most active. coumarins were the most effective compounds against gram-negative bacteria. the extract meoh/ch2cl2 (1: 4) m2 at 0.4 microg/disk inhibited the growth of e. coli and p. mirabilis (40%), k. pneumoniae (31.1%), salmonella sp. (35.5%), and shigella sp. (0%) at 72 h of culture. the dimethoxy compounds 6 and 7 showed a strong activity against fungal  strains, especially t. mentagrophytes and r. solani (100% of inhibition at 125.0  and 250.0 microg/ml, respectively).

TI  == surface microflora of four smear-ripened cheeses.
AB  == the microbial composition of smear-ripened cheeses is not very clear. a total of  194 bacterial isolates and 187 yeast isolates from the surfaces of four irish farmhouse smear-ripened cheeses were identified at the midpoint of ripening using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), repetitive sequence-based pcr, and 16s rrna gene sequencing for identifying and typing the bacteria and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and mitochondrial dna restriction fragment length polymorphism (mtdna rflp) analysis for identifying and typing the yeast. the yeast microflora was very uniform, and debaryomyces hansenii was the dominant species in the four cheeses. yarrowia lipolytica was also isolated in low numbers from one cheese. the bacteria were highly diverse, and 14 different species, corynebacterium casei, corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter arilaitensis, arthrobacter sp., microbacterium gubbeenense, agrococcus sp. nov., brevibacterium linens, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus equorum, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus luteus, halomonas venusta, vibrio sp., and bacillus sp., were identified on the four cheeses. each cheese had a more or less unique microflora with four to nine species on its surface. however, two bacteria, c. casei and a. arilaitensis, were found on each cheese. diversity at the strain level was also observed, based on the different pfge patterns and mtdna rflp profiles of the dominant bacterial and yeast species. none of the ripening cultures deliberately inoculated onto the surface were reisolated from the cheeses. this study confirms the importance of the adventitious, resident microflora in the ripening of smear cheeses.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == [organic extracts with antimicrobian activity from penicillium sp. (moniliales) isolated from the sponge ircinia felix (porifera: demospongiae)].
AB  == this research expresses the potential of the bacterial activity present in the organic extracts obtained from penicillium sp., isolated from the esponge irciniafelix. this activity was evaluated through agar diffusion test and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic). the susceptibility trials of organic fractions were carried out against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis. the use of the chromatographic techniques (clv and tlc), permitted to obtain bioactive organic extracts of different polarities, of which  only the etoac and meoh fractions inhibited the growth of the bacteria used. of the etoac fractionation, only fraction number 3 etoac/hex presented greatest activity against the gram-positive bacteria. number 1 etoac/hex fraction increased its activity against s. aureus (24 mm) and s. epidermidis (25 mm), which can be explained by the loss of possible antagonistic effect during the fractionation process. the cmi trials were carried out for the etoac number i subfraction against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, b. cereus and b. subtilis, wich was clinical interest, and shows the potential of this organic extract as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of lantana  xenica.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria  micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.

TI  == antibiotic-labeled probes and microvolume fluorimetry for the rapid detection of  bacterial contamination in platelet components: a preliminary report.
AB  == background: approximately 1 platelet in 2000 components is bacterially contaminated. most commonly, contaminating organisms are gram positive skin saprophytes (such as staphylococcus sp. or bacillus sp.). a novel approach to the rapid diagnosis of gram positive contamination by the use of a fluorescence-labeled antibiotic probe with affinity for the gram positive cell was investigated. study design and methods: two isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis were inoculated into bags of day 0 platelets. quantitative cultures along with a semi-automated screening assay on a microvolume fluorimeter employing a fluorescence-conjugated vancomycin probe was performed for each day of storage. in addition, serial dilutions of the bacteria were added to sterile platelets to achieve a range spanning 10(1) to 10(8) cfus per ml. results: all samples with a bacterial contamination of > or =10(5) cfu per ml were detected. sterile samples were nonreactive. the entire procedure requires three pipetting steps and took less than 1 hour to perform. conclusion: these preliminary results with the use of fluorescence-labeled antibiotics as probes combined with microvolume fluorimetry for the rapid detection of bacterial contamination of platelet components suggest that this is a promising approach. further studies with additional organisms and alternative conjugates, bacteria, and antibiotics are underway.

TI  == bacterial interdigital scaly erythema (kitamura): a possible new clinical entity.
AB  == four patients with scaly erythema on their finger webs and sides of their fingers during summer are described. these patients were working in either butcher's shops or a sushi bar, where they handled raw meat, chicken or fish for many hours. the eruptions first appeared as scaly erythema, sometimes accompanied by small pustules, on the second, third and fourth finger webs, and later the erythema extended to the sides of the fingers and palms. maceration and/or shallow erosion sometimes appeared on the finger webs. symptoms were usually mild; the patients complained of slight itching, irritation or pain. direct examination of specimens stained with parker blue-black ink containing koh revealed scales containing bacterial granules or filaments. several species of bacteria were cultured including corynebacterium sp. fungus was not detected in either koh specimens or in cultures. the lesions responded rapidly to topical or  oral antibiotics; however, they recurred frequently during hot and humid weather. hitherto a similar condition has not been described and is possibly a new clinical entity.

AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii.
AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == influence of fowl uropygial gland and its secretory lipid components on growth of skin surface bacteria of fowl.
AB  == bacterial species, which occur on the breast skin surface of adult (1 year old) white leghorn fowl with intact uropygial gland, were identified as : staphylococcus epidermidis, sarcina lutea, streptomyces sp. and a facultative diphtheroid belonging to the genus corynebacterium; s. epidermidis being the most predominant one. two species of bacteria, namely, staphylococcus aureus and proteus sp. were shown to colonize the skin surface after 60 days of captivity. extirpation of uropygial gland caused severe depletion of population of s. epidermidis, streptomyces sp. and diphtheroid. the effect was more conspicuous after 60 days compared to that after 30 days of the gland removal. on the skin surface of glandless fowls the population of s. aureus increased significantly and a new form identified as anthracoid bacillus became the most predominant species after 60 days. addition of total lipids from the free-flowing fowl uropygial secretion, as 0.2% suspension, to trypticase soya broth cultures of individual bacteria of fowl skin surface encouraged strongly the growth of s. epidermidis, streptomyces sp. and proteus sp. but suppressed the population of the anthracoid. when identical amount of diester wax or wax alcohol of the secretion was supplemented to the culture, more or less similar result was obtained. wax alcohol also had a mild inhibitory effect on streptomyces sp. wax acids, added to the culture (0.2%) suppressed population of all the bacterial forms except proteus sp., while the hydrocarbon fraction, which also contained some amount of squalene, produce an opposite effect.

AB  == results of skin cultures obtained before 413 of 505 operations for cerebrospinal  fluid-diverting ventricular shunt placement or revision in a pediatric population from april 1980 to may 1983 are analyzed and compared to results of cultures from 20 subsequent shunt infections. sensitivities to 11 different antibiotics were determined for each isolate cultured. the total operative infection rate was 20 of 505 (4%). gram-negative bacilli alone accounted for 3 of 20 (15%) shunt infections. one gram-negative bacillus/staphylococcus aureus infection occurred.  factors predisposing for gram-negative bacillus shunt infection were found in all 4 cases. the majority of shunt infections were caused by typical resident skin organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis alone, 9/20 (45%); staphylococcus aureus alone, 4/20 (20%); corynebacterium sp., 1/20 (5%); alpha-streptococcus with s. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%); and micrococcus with s. epidermidis, 1/20 (5%). only 4 (20%) of the 20 shunt infections were due to organisms identical to those originally grown from the skin. another 4 (20%) seemed to be infected with a strain of organism different from that initially recovered from the skin. the remaining skin organism shunt infections may or may not have come from the patient's skin. the data suggest that not all skin organism shunt infections arise from contamination by resident skin bacteria at the incision sites at the time of operation. alternate sources for the infecting organisms are discussed. the antibiotic sensitivity data on skin isolates and shunt isolates suggest that  vancomycin is the antibiotic best suited for prophylaxis against shunt infection  at our institution.

TI  == the nosocomial colonization of t. bear.
AB  == a national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the national institutes of health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. the program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (t. bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. one of the items used is a stuffed toy t. bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the t. bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. a prospective study of 39 sterilized t. bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. hospital acquired organisms cultured from the t. bear included staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, corynebacterium acnes, micrococcus sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillus sp, and species of candida, cryptococcus, trichosporon, aspergillus and others. concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. although the t. bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.

AB  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). a total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). a total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). the predominant aerobic isolates were s. epidermidis, s. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas sp., and group d streptococcus. the predominant anaerobic isolates were: p. acnes, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and bacteroides sp. blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: s. aureus, e. coli, peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and b. fragilis. the numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). gram-negative enteric rods and group d streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and p. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. all children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. these data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.

TI  == aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. the most frequently isolated microorganisms included: iij, ef-4, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci, corynebacterium sp., enterobacteria, neisseria sp., moraxella sp., and bacillus sp. other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. the high incidence of iij, ef-4, p. multocida, and s. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.

TI  == bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  == during 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. the mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: streptococcus (5 species), lactobacillus sp, veillonella alcalescens, staphylococcus aureus, staph epidermidis, propioni-bacterium acnes, corynebacterium acnes, and bacillus subtilis. seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. there was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. a  follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.

TI  == a simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  == an efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. the caesarean-derived infant dutch or japanese-white rabbits and their hybrids (f1; japanese-white female x dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, a and b, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (table 2) and  administered intragastrically once a day through a nelaton's catheter. bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. on the third day, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus, and bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. the weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. there was, however, no significant difference milk diet a and b on the weaning rate.

TI  == a special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  == a 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. there is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. another died. at autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. the deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (scid). the autopsy findings showed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of scid. after a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (dv) was placed in the isolator. laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes  showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (pha). specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. the patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four hla matches but none has  been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (mlc). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter agglomerans, microcossu sp. subgroup 1,  bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: p. acnes, c. bifermentans, b. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, e. agglomerans, c. parapsilosis. no viruses or protozoa have been isolated. at age 3 years, the mean quantitation of  anaerobic cells was 7.9 x 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. the mean aerobic concentration was 1.2  x 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. this child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...

TI  == [kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
