TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for ABSSSI and CABP; and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant Gram-positive organisms and select Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. Ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. There is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been published in a small series of case reports. Randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity against organisms isolated from respiratory tract infections in USA hospitals: results from the AWARE Program, 2009-2011.
AB  - The Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation Program monitors the  activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against pathogens causing either respiratory or skin and soft tissue infections. A total of 7733 isolates from patients in 80 medical centers across the United States (USA) identified as respiratory tract pathogens by the infection type and/or specimen site recorded by the submitting laboratory during 2009-2011 were evaluated. There were 3360 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1799 Haemophilus influenzae, 1087 Staphylococcus aureus, 678 Moraxella catarrhalis, 459 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 223 Escherichia coli, and 127 Klebsiella oxytoca. Annual penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae ranged from 21.9 to 24.3%. All S. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at a ceftaroline MIC of </=0.5 mug/mL with 100.0% of isolates categorized as susceptible. Ceftaroline was 16-fold more active than ceftriaxone and 32-fold more active than amoxicillin-clavulanate against penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Only 49.8% of the penicillin-resistant isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. There were a total of 1087 S. aureus (48.9% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) isolates, and the yearly MRSA rate ranged from 47.9 to 49.7%. The ceftaroline MIC50/90 for S. aureus was at 0.25/1 mug/mL; 98.2% susceptible and no resistant strains (>/=4 mug/mL). Ceftaroline activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 and 0.25 mug/mL, respectively; 100% susceptible) was 2- to 4-fold greater than for MRSA (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/mL; 96.2% susceptible). The ceftriaxone MIC90 for MSSA was 4 mug/mL. Ceftaroline was active against H. influenzae (MIC50/90 </=0.015/0.03 mug/mL; 100.0% susceptible) and against M. catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/mL). Ceftaroline was active against non-extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype strains of Enterobacteriaceae but not against ESBL-positive phenotype strains. In summary, ceftaroline was highly active against a large collection of bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in the USA during 2009 through 2011.
TI  - Secretion of a pneumococcal type II secretion system pilus correlates with DNA uptake during transformation.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that successfully adapts to the host environment via an efficient uptake system for free DNA liberated from other organisms in the upper respiratory tract, facilitating immune evasion and drug resistance. Although the initial signaling events leading to pneumococcal competence for DNA transformation and the fate of DNA when it has been taken up have been extensively studied, the actual mechanism by which DNA in the environment may traverse the thick capsular and cell wall layers remains unknown. Here we visualize that induction of competence results in the formation of a native morphologically distinct pilus structure on the bacterial surface. This plaited pilus is encoded by the competence (com)G locus, and, after assembly, it is rapidly released into the surrounding medium. Heterologous pneumococcal pilus expression in Escherichia coli was obtained by replacing the pulE-K putative pilin genes of the Klebsiella oxytoca type II secretion system with the complete comG locus. In the pneumococcus, the coordinated secretion of pili from the cells correlates to DNA transformation. A model for DNA transformation is proposed whereby pilus assembly "drills" a channel across the thick cell wall that becomes transiently open by secretion of the pilus, providing the entry port for exogenous DNA to gain access to DNA receptors associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - [Vitreal surgery and etiological diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of vitreal surgery and the importance of etiological diagnosis in the treatment for bacterial endophthalmitis. METHODS: Retrospective series case study. 20 cases (20 eyes) of bacterial endophthalmitis that were treated in Peking Union Hospital were enrolled. 14 eyes were post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and 6 eyes were postoperative endophthalmitis. Twenty cases of aged 3 to 83 years [mean (40.5 +/- 23.9) years] were enrolled, including 12 male and 8 female patients. Pre-operative visual acuity: 2 cases were able to count fingers, 6 cases were able to perform hand movement, 11 cases had light perception, light projection were uncertain in all cases, and there was no light perception in 1 case. Hypopyon was seen in 13 eyes. Severe anterior chamber inflammatory reaction was seen in the other 7 eyes. The fundus could not be observed in all 20 eyes. B-Scan ultrasound examination indicated that all 20 eyes displayed moderate to severe vitreous opacity; proliferation and organization were apparent in 12 eyes, and retinal detachment in 2 eyes. Vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were performed in 18 eyes, and only intravitreal injection of antibiotics was administered in the other 2 eyes. At the beginning of operation, vitreous fluids were smeared and Gram stained. To eyes that showed a positive result in Gram staining, 1 mg of Vancomycin was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (balanced salt solution, BSS) in the eyes. To eyes that showed a negative result in Gram staining, 2 mg or 4 mg of Ceftazidime was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (BSS) in the eyes, respectively. Additionally, we examined the vitreous specimens and performed drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria cultured from the specimens. The antibiotics that the bacteria were susceptible to were chosen according to the drug sensitivity tests. The follow-up period is from 1 to 102 months (average 16.6 months). RESULTS: Thirteen eyes presented with a positive Gram staining result, and 3 eyes presented a negative result; the other 4 eyes were not infected. Bacteria were cultured in 15 eyes. The detection rate of pathogen was 75%. The result for 11 eyes was consistent with the smear results. The bacteria detected were Staphylococcus aureus in 3 eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 eyes, and Bacillus spp in 2 eyes. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Plesiomonas, Pseudomonas cepacia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Loffi Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in 1 eye. The remaining 5 eyes did not have bacterial growth. The intraocular infection of all 20 eyes was controlled, and the intraocular inflammation was relieved. The visual acuity was significantly elevated. Postoperative visual acuity achieved were >/= 0.3 in 4 eyes, 0.1 to 0.2 in 4 eyes, 0.02 to 0.09 in 6 eyes, CF in 2 eyes, HM in 3 eyes and LP in 1 eye. The retinas of 17 eyes were normal, but recurrent retinal detachment occurred in the other 3 eyes, postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy combined with antibiotics and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were an effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis. We obtained the vitreous fluid smears at the beginning of surgery to quickly and accurately obtain etiological diagnoses by Gram staining. It is crucial to use etiological diagnosis to choose the susceptible antibiotics.
TI  - High load of multi-drug resistant nosocomial neonatal pathogens carried by cockroaches in a neonatal intensive care unit at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches have been described as potential vectors for various pathogens for decades; although studies from neonatal intensive care units are scarce. This study assessed the vector potential of cockroaches (identified as Blatella germanica) in a neonatal intensive care unit setup in Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 400 Blatella germanica roaches were aseptically collected for five consecutive months. Standard laboratory procedures were used to process the samples. RESULTS: From the external and gut homogenates, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter aeruginosa, Salmonella C1, Non Group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Shigella flexneri were isolated. Multi-drug resistance was seen in all organisms. Resistance to up to all the 12 antimicrobials tested was observed in different pathogens. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches could play a vector role for nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit and environmental control measures of these vectors is required to reduce the risk of infection. A high level of drug resistance pattern of the isolated pathogens was demonstrated.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Complications of PORT-A-CATH(R) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (SCD). However, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (CVCs) in adult patients with moderate or severe SCD. AIMS: To review our experience with the use of the PORT-A-CATH((R)) device in sixteen patients with SCD undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. METHODS: Among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen SCD patients required the insertion of a PORT-A-CATH((R)) device. These patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- SD]. A total of 24 PORT-A-CATH((R)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. Eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. RESULTS: Out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. The organisms involved were Candida spp. (3), C. Parapsilosis (2), C. albicans (1), C. famata (1), C. lusitanice (1), Staphylococcus spp. (6), and S. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic Streptococcus (1), Diphtheroid bacilli (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Ps. Spp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella spp. (1), Serratia liquefaciens (1), Serratia fanticola (1), Achromobacter spp. (2) Chromobacterium violaceum (1), Delftia acidovirans (1), Stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), Alcaligenes faecalis (1), and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. One case presented with right atrial thrombosis/SVC syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. Two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. The median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). The rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [Pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that patients with SCD suffer infective complications associated with the PORT-A-CATH((R)), which often necessitate its removal. Although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.
TI  - Assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  - Despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. One key component of better control of this disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. Mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. Development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. This study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial DNA extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples to complement traditional microbiological identification. Extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. The following species were identified: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Klebsiella spp. (including Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The detection procedure includes specific genomic DNA amplification by multiplex PCR for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. The specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. The extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. The analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/mL for milk samples spiked with Staph. aureus, Strep. dysgalactiae, and E. coli, with a tendency for K. pneumoniae. The detection limit was 500 cfu/mL for Strep. uberis and Strep. agalactiae. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. When the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, DNA purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. Of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive Staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16S sequencing. The proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated PCR detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - XLA-associated neutropenia treatment: a case report and review of the literature.
AB  - X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary B-cell deficiency syndrome with an incidence of 5 to 10 cases per million. The current treatment approach includes intravenous immunoglobulin and aggressive antibiotic regimens for infections. Besides recurrent infections, XLA patients may present with other manifestations, such as alopecia, enteropathy, amyloidosis, and neutropenia. Neutropenia, which has been shown in up to 25% of affected patients, might also contribute to the degree of severity of bacterial infections that have been reported in these cases. Here we present our experience with the granulocyte colony-stimulant factor, filgrastim (Neupogen), in the treatment of neutropenia in a 14-month-old child with XLA.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Faecal coliform bacteria in Febros river (northwest Portugal): temporal variation, correlation with water parameters, and species identification.
AB  - Febros river water was sampled weekly, during 35 successive weeks, and analyzed for microbiological (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and enterococci) and chemical-physical (ammonia and temperature) parameters. All microbiological parameters were highly correlated with each other and with ammonia, suggesting that the simultaneous determination of all variables currently in use in the evaluation of the microbiological quality of waters is probably redundant, and could be simplified, and that ammonia should be tested as a sentinel parameter of the microbiological pollution load of Febros river. From the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms test (multiple tube fermentation technique) and retested in this assay, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains were positive, indicating that the faecal coliforms test is not totally specific for Escherichia coli, and can detect other bacteria. Considering that these Klebsiella spp. are not necessarily of faecal origin, it was concluded that the faecal coliforms test can overestimate true faecal pollution. From the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms procedure, only Escherichia coli strains were clearly positive in the beta-D-glucuronidase test. All other species were negative or very weakly positive, suggesting that the assay of the beta-D-glucuronidase activity is less prone to false positives than the faecal coliforms test in the quantification of Escherichia coli in environmental waters.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - Clinical effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin on hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin (CPFX) on hospital-acquired pneumonia was examined. The subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group I, group II, and group III, based on The Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. None of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. CPFX 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. Intravenous CPEX was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of Serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of Klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). Abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. Based on the above data, intravenous CPFX may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - [Bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. The sooner the diagnosis is established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. When the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. On the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. It is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. The AIM of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in the Paediatric Department of the Institute from January 1, 1978 to December 31, 2000. Patients originated from all parts of Yugoslavia. After the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. CSF was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. Diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by CSF culture; 2. elevation of CSF leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the Gram stain of CSF sediment. In 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Causes of meningitis were as follows: E. coli in 46 newborns (N) (26.5%), Streptococcus B haemolyticus group B in 35 N (20.2%), K. pneumoniae in 27 N (15.6%), K. oxytoca in 3 N (1.7%), Proteus spp in 14 N (8%), Salmonella spp in 12 N, Pseudomonas spp in 9 N, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 N, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 N, Enterobacter spp in 3 N, L. monocytogenes and Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus in 2 N each, and in one N. meningitidis, Streptococcus group D, Citrobacter, Morganella morganii and Alkaligenes xilosoxidans. Over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: E. coli (28.2%), SBHB (26.8%) and Klebsiella spp (11.3%). Over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: Klebsiella spp (26.8%), E. coli (19.2%), SBHB (14.1%), etc. In addition, new causes appeared, namely: Morganella morganii, Citrobacter, K. oxitoca and Alkaligenes xylosoxidans (Table 2). Of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died: of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (Table 1). Comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (Table 2). The explanation might be that the patients came to the Institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. The precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. Newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions where the intensive care units for newborns exist. CONCLUSION: The most frequent causes of meningitis are the following: E. coli, SBHB and Klebsiella pn. Frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. New uncommon causes have appeared. The mortality-rate remained very high.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - Bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.
AB  - A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in Taiwan from January 1999 to December 1999 was performed. There were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. Three of the 5 isolates of S. aureus were resistant to methicillin. Twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. Of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent antibiotic use, P. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (10%), K. pneumoniae (10%), Escherichia coli (10%), and E. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. Relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were the independent risk factors of bacteremia. There were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, S. aureus, and Streptococcus mitis, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against recent clinical isolates of bacteria in Korea.
AB  - Gemifloxacin is an enhanced-affinity fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. In Korea, resistant bacteria are relatively more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. In this study, we studied the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other commonly used antimicrobial agents against 1,689 bacterial strains isolated at four Korean university hospitals during 1999-2000. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the agar dilution method of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Gemifloxacin had the lowest MICs for the respiratory pathogens: 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.03 mg/L, respectively. Gemifloxacin was more active than the other fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC90s of gemifloxacin for Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. were 0.25, 1.0, and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, while those for other Gram-negative bacilli were 4-64 mg/L. In conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active among the comparative agents against Gram-positive species, including respiratory pathogens isolated in Korea.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters in young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of bacterial colonization of IV catheters  among young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis, to identify the organisms responsible for catheter colonization, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms that were obtained. DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: 100 dogs. PROCEDURE: Catheters were aseptically removed when fluid therapy was discontinued, the catheter was replaced, or the dog died. The distal tip of the catheter was cut off, split open, and vortexed with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. The saline solution was plated on culture plates, which were then incubated and examined for bacterial growth every 24 hours for 72 hours. All bacteria cultured were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 22 catheters. Most bacteria that were isolated were of gastrointestinal tract or environmental origin (Serratia odorifera, S. liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Acinobacter anitratus, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp). Only 2 gram-positive organisms were isolated (Staphylococcus intermedius and Streptococcus spp). High percentages of organisms were resistant to penicillin, lincomycin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin. Percentages of organisms resistant to amikacin, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, potentiated sulfonamides, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were low. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that IV catheters may be colonized with bacteria in 22% of young dogs suspected to have parvovirus infection.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Predictors of infectious complications after burn injuries in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. Knowledge of their occurrence and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. We performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. OBJECTIVE: To delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. METHODS: Children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. Characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (TBSA), burn 15%]. Twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis, 6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13 involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia, 2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). Twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by CDC criteria no organism was recovered. Organisms causing infection were: Staphylococcus aureus, 19; Candida albicans, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 4; Enterococcus sp., 3; Escherichia coli, 1; Klebsiella oxytoca, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and Candida parapsilosis, 1. Burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (TBSA >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors for infection; young age and site of burn were not. CONCLUSION: The most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. Characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. Children with flame and inhalation injury, TBSA burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  - An optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, Clostridium bifermentans and C. sordellii, and Prevotella bivia. Serial electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. Four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. Thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. The analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. The method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of S. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. Since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - Suture abscesses after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - Eighteen suture abscesses that developed after penetrating keratoplasty in 15 patients were reviewed. The time from keratoplasty to the diagnosis of an abscess ranged from 1 to 53 months with a mean of 21.5 months. In 13 of the 18 cases, the patient was taking topical steroids at the time of diagnosis. All were culture-proven bacterial ulcers, except for one case that had a positive Gram's stain, but no growth on culture. The organisms cultured were Staphylococcus epidemidis (six eyes), Streptococcus pneumoniae (five eyes), Sta. aureus (four eyes), Str. viridans (two eyes), Klebsiella oxytoca (one eye), Serratia marcescens (one eye), Moraxella sp (one eye), and Escherichia coli (one eye). The offending suture was removed in all cases, and the eyes were treated with topical fortified antibiotics (cefazolin and tobramycin). After treatment, 67% (12 of 18 eyes) had clear grafts, 17% (three of 18 eyes) were scarred, and 16% (three of 19 eyes) had failed grafts. Intensive topical steroid therapy was used when a subsequent graft rejection developed. Retained sutures following corneal transplants can result in sight-threatening infections and should be considered for removal as soon as the wound is well healed.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of CDZM and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. The followings are a summary of the results: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter diversus, most of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Some strains of Klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant Escherichia coli seemed likely. Among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including CDZM and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. MIC90's of CDZM against Streptococcus spp., H. infleunzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. This indicates that CDZM would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. However, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant S. pneumoniae, cephem resistant E. coli and cephem resistant K. oxytoca with CDZM. 3. Among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. Therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of CDZM with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. Antibacterial activities of CDZM we observed in this study seem to indicate that CDZM concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above MIC levels for relatively long periods of time.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. I. Antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester HR 916. RU 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci RU 29 246 (MIC90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. RU 29 246 inhibited hemolytic Streptococci of the serogroups A, B, C and G as well as penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). MIC90s of RU 29 246 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Only RU 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Most strains of Pseudomonas spp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., Hafnia alvei and Bacteroides spp. were resistant to RU 29 246. RU 29 246 killed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times MIC. The pH value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of RU 29 246. RU 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Clinical examination of ceftibuten in acute bronchitis].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of ceftibuten (CETB, 7432-S) was performed in 20 patients with acute bronchitis. They were consisted of 10 males and 10 females aged from 20 to 80 years old. CETB was given orally in daily dose of 300 mg (18 cases) or 600 mg (2 cases) in three divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 to 14 days. Especially they were given for 7 days in 16 cases. A total of 11 strains comprising 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of beta-Streptococcus and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii were identified from sputa before administration. All of the above bacteria were eradicated but, in 1 case, a strain of Streptococcus pyogenes appeared after the treatment (eradication ratio = 100%). The clinical efficacy rate was 100%: Responses were excellent in 3 cases and good in 17 cases. There was no side effect and no abnormal changes in laboratory test results. From the avobe results, it is concluded that CETB is effective, safe and useful new oral cephem on acute bronchitis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new carbapenem, SM-7338.
AB  - SM-7338, a new carbapenem, inhibited most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at MICs of 0.015 to 0.25 microgram/ml, including Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus vulgaris isolates resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin. It was two- to eightfold more active than imipenem, but it inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1 to 8 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of imipenem. Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Branhamella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, which was superior to the activity of imipenem. SM-7338 inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at 0.25 microgram/ml, but for methicillin-resistant isolates MICs were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. Group A, B, and C streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. Bacteroides species, including clindamycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. There was no major inoculum size effect, and the MBCs were within a dilution of the MICs. SM-7338 was more active than imipenem at an acid pH under anaerobic conditions. Plasmid beta-lactamases of TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, SHV-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, PSE-3, OXA-2, OXA-3, OXA-4, OXA-5, and OXA-7; Staphylococcus aureus enzymes; and the chromosomal beta-lactamases P-99 and K-1; Morganella species; and Proteus vulgaris did not hydrolyze SM-7338. The repeated transfer of organisms increased the MICs of SM-7338, as it did the MICs of imipenem.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of S 6472 granule preparation (sustained-release cefaclor) in chronic bronchitis].
AB  - S 6472 granule preparation, a sustained-release cefaclor, was orally administered to 20 acutely exacerbated cases of chronic bronchitis at a daily dosage of 750 mg (titer) in 2 divided doses for a duration of 7-15 days and its clinical usefulness was evaluated. Clinical efficacies were good in 17 cases and fair in 3 cases, with a rate of efficacy of 85.0%. Organisms isolated from 13 patients were totalling 14 strains, i.e., 5 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 2 strains of Streptococcus sp., 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 strain of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus. All these strains, except the strains of Streptococcus sp., disappeared upon the administration of the drug. With regard to the safety, no side effects nor abnormal laboratory test values were encountered.
TI  - Bacterial interference by anaerobic species isolated from human feces.
AB  - Eighty-four anaerobic fecal isolates obtained from five healthy volunteers were tested for their ability to inhibit in vitro growth of eight species of Enterobacteriaceae, four species of faculative gram-positive cocci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Forty-nine of the 84 anaerobic isolates (58%) inhibited the growth of at least one indicator bacterium. Isolates of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp. were most consistently inhibitory. Anaerobic cocci and clostridia were infrequently inhibitory; eubacteria showed no inhibitory activity. Serratia marcescens was the indicator most often inhibited; 54% of all anaerobic isolates tested, all of nine Bifidobacterium isolates and 33 of 43 Bacteroides isolates inhibited this organism. No anaerobes inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - [Piperacillin in the newborn infant. A clinical and pharmacologic study].
AB  - The study involved 70 neonates born at 27 to 48 weeks of pregnancy (mean: 34.2 weeks) and weighing between 840 and 4350 g (mean: 1860 g). In every case piperacillin was combined with an aminoglycoside. The infants were treated for materno-foetal infection (14), post-partum infection (19), enterocolitis (18, surgical in 9 cases) and other post-operative infections (19). The antibiotic combination was given prophylactically in 2 cases. Fifty micro-organisms were isolated in 39 patients: 24 from blood (hemoculture), 2 from CSF, 24 from multiple peripheral samples. There were 13 Gram-positive organisms (Streptococcus B, D, A, Listeria spp.) and 37 Gram-negative organisms (E. coli 14, Klebsiella spp. 10, Enterobacter spp. 6). Clinical and bacteriological cure was obtained in 67 patients. Three failures were recorded, with resistance to treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae and emergence (at hemoculture) of Klebsiella oxytoca under treatment in one patient and of Enterobacter cloacae in another patient. A pharmacokinetic study was performed in 47 neonates. Piperacillin (75 mg/kg per dose) was given twice a day until the 8th day post-partum and three times a day subsequently. The antibiotic was administered either by 30-min infusions or by intravenous or intramuscular injections; 124 serum level measurements were carried out at peak and/or residual level. In 44 infants with normal renal and hepatic function the mean residual level was 23 micrograms/ml (range: 7-100 micrograms/ml) and the mean peak level was 119 micrograms/ml (range: 47-278 micrograms/ml). No local or systemic side-effect was noted, and there was no evidence of toxicity.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftazidime increased by netilmicin.
AB  - Cephalosporins are often used in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics in the treatment of gram-negative infections. Although ceftazidime possesses activity against gram-negative bacteria, especially against Pseudomonas, combined use with aminoglycosides is useful. In this study, 12 healthy volunteers (6 men, 6 women; mean age 21.5 yr) received a single dose of ceftazidime 1 g iv and one week later ceftazidime 1 g iv with netilmicin 100 mg iv. Both antibiotics were infused over five minutes. Concentrations of ceftazidime were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was evaluated against seven microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. The mean peak serum level of ceftazidime was 113.4 micrograms/ml. At eight hours, we observed a concentration of 2.6 micrograms/ml. The total clearance was 126 ml/min, while the renal clearance was 100 ml/min. Ceftazidime exhibited a half-life of 1.9 hours. Up to ten hours, the SBA of ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi was greater than 1:8 in more than 90 percent of samples. At one hour, ceftazidime exhibited a SBA of 1:4 for Staphylococcus aureus, and 1:16 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With the addition of netilmicin, median SBA against Staph. aureus and P. aeruginosa were 1:32 and 1:64, respectively, at one hour. Netilmicin enhanced the SBA of ceftazidime. The combination was not effective against Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a new N-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest MICs of the antibiotics tested. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of Klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. The superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of P. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime. Carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. Carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. In general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (MIC); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin and seven other antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was tested against 469 clinical isolates derived mainly from urinary samples from outpatients. It inhibited all Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus strains at a concentration of 0.25 micrograms/ml, and all Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains at a concentration of 8 micrograms/ml or less. Norfloxacin proved to be more effective than nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, mecillinam and nitrofurantoin against all gram-negative rods tested.
TI  - Evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  - An experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. The teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. Included were: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Numerous strains were tested for strain differences. Environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. All excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 X 10(8) cfu/ml. Negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. Positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. Effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. The sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. However, differences were generally slight. The experimental teat dip appeared effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. Lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with Staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was basically and clinically studied in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was compared with that of CEZ, CMZ and ABPC. T-1982 was more active than the other drugs against Gram-negative bacteria, the sensitivity of E. coli (22 strains), K. pneumoniae (18 strains), P. mirabilis (19 strains), P. vulgaris (4 strains), P. morganii (5 strains) and K. oxytoca (4 strains) distributing less than 0.39, 0.1, 1.56, 0.39, 6.25 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. Two of 3 strains of C. freundii were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of T-1982 was inferior to that of the other drugs. S. pyogenes (28 strains) were inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml or less, but the sensitivity of S. aureus (34 strains distributed 12.5-100 micrograms/ml). 2. T-1982 was administered to each 3 children at a dose of 20 mg/kg by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion, or at dose of 40 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion. The mean serum levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were respectively 74.3, 56.3, 42.3, 17.6, 5.7 and 1.2 micrograms/ml with the mean half-life of 1.01 hours. The values were 32.9, 50.0, 73.7, 27.5, 12.4 and 4.5 micrograms/ml and 1.31 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg and 50.4, 104.7, 136.3, 62.3, 18.6 and 6.9 micrograms/ml and 1.16 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 40 mg/kg. The mean urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 47.7, 67.6 and 60.9%, respectively. 3. Treatment with T-1982 was made in 28 cases of pediatric infections; 1 case of acute bronchitis, 19 cases of acute bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 4 cases of acute pyelonephritis and each 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and suspected bacterial endocarditis. The clinical responses assessed in 27 cases were excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 96.3%. Bacteriologically, 2 strains of S. aureus, 3 strains of S. pneumoniae, 4 strains of H. influenzae, 2 strains of E. coli and 1 strain of P. mirabilis were eradicated. One strain of S. faecalis was reduced. No side effects were observed in any cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT and that of GOT were noted in each 1 case.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperzone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, were carried out  in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. Peak MIC of T-1982 against S. pyogenes (group A) lately isolated was 0.39 micrograms/ml, and the drug was active even against highly resistant strains of macrolides, lincomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. 2. Peak MICs of T-1982 were 0.78 microgram/ml against B. pertussis, 0.2 microgram/ml against E. coli and less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml against K. oxytoca, and the drug was also active against ampicillin-resistant bacteria. 3. Serum levels and urinary excretions of T-1982 were investigated in 6 cases. When given at a dose of 20-28 mg/kg by 1 hour intravenous drip infusion, serum concentrations of T-1982 attained the peak level of 63.5-75.9 micrograms/ml at the end of administration and sustained the level of 0.9-2.6 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, the serum half-life (T 1/2) ranging 70-82 minutes. Approximately 20-72% of the dose were excreted in the active form into urine within 6 hours. 4. Twenty-seven cases of acute pediatric infections were treated with T-1982 mainly by intravenous drip infusion, and satisfactory clinical results were obtained in all the cases of angina lacunaris, bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, pertussis, sepsis caused by Serratia and acute urinary tract infections caused by ampicillin-resistant E. coli. The efficacy rate was 96.3%. In this study the drug was administered chiefly at a daily dose of 50-70 mg/kg 2-3 times a day for 2-12 days. 5. Gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes) and Gram-negative rods (H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae P. vulgaris, B. pertussis, S. marcescens, E. coli) were eradicated by the treatment with T-1982. 6. No noticeable side effects were observed, except for temporary increase of eosinophil in 2 cases and slight elevation of GOT in 1 case.
