TI  == advancing rhodobacter sphaeroides as a platform for expression of functional membrane proteins.
AB  == membrane protein overexpression is often hindered by toxic effects on the expression host, limiting achievable volumetric productivity. moreover, protein structure and function may be impaired due to inclusion body formation and proteolytic degradation. to address these challenges, we employed the photosynthetic bacterium, rhodobacter sphaeroides for expression of challenging membrane proteins including human aquaporin 9 (haqp9), human tight junction protein occludin (occ), escherichia coli toxin peptide ghot, cellulose synthase enzyme complex (bcsab) of r. sphaeroides and cytochrome-cy (cyt-cy) from rhodobacter capsulatus. titers of 47mg/l for cyt-cy, 7.5mg/l for occ, 1.5mg/l for bcsab and 0.5mg/l for haqp9 were achieved from affinity purification. while purification of ghot was not successful, transformants displayed a distinct growth phenotype that correlated with ghot expression. we also evaluated the functionality of these proteins by performing water transport studies for haqp9,  peroxidase activity for cytochrome-cy, and in vitro cellulose synthesis activity  assay for bcsab. while previous studies with rhodobacter have utilized oxygen-limited semi-aerobic growth for membrane protein expression. substantial titer improvements are achieved as a result of a 3-fold increase in biomass yield using the anaerobic photoheterotrophic growth regime, which utilizes the strong native puc promoter. this versatile platform is shown to enable recovery of a wide variety of difficult-to-express membrane proteins in functional form.

TI  == high-level soluble expression of the hema gene from rhodobacter capsulatus and comparative study of its enzymatic properties.
AB  == the rhodobacter capsulatus hema gene, which encodes 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (alas), was expressed in escherichia coli rosetta (de3) and the enzymatic properties of the purified recombinant alas (rc-alas) were studied. compared with alass encoded by hema genes from agrobacterium radiobacter (ar-alas) and rhodobacter sphaeroides (rs-alas), the specific activity of rc-alas reached 198.2 u/mg, which was about 31.2% and 69.5% higher than those of ar-alas  (151.1 u/mg) and rs-alas (116.9 u/mg), respectively. the optimum ph values and temperatures of the three above mentioned enzymes were all ph 7.5 and 37 degrees  c, respectively. moreover, rc-alas was more sensitive to ph, while the other two  were sensitive to temperature. the effects of metals, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (edta), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) on the three alass were also investigated. the results indicate that they had the same effects on the activities of the three alass. sds and metal ions such as co(2+), zn(2+), and cu(2+) strongly inhibited the activities of the alass, while mn(2+) exerted slight inhibition, and k(+), ca(2+), ba(2+), mg(2+), or edta had no significant effect. the specificity constant of succinyl coenzyme a [(kcat/km)(s-coa)] of rc-alas was 1.4989, which was higher than those of ar-alas (0.7456) and rs-alas (1.1699), showing its high catalytic efficiency. the fed-batch fermentation was conducted using the recombinant strain containing the r. capsulatus hema gene, and the yield of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ala) achieved was 8.8 g/l (67 mmol/l) under the appropriate conditions.

TI  == rhodobacter capsulatus dpra is essential for reca-mediated gene transfer agent (rcgta) recipient capability regulated by quorum-sensing and the ctra response regulator.
AB  == gene transfer agents (gtas) are genetic exchange elements that resemble small dna bacteriophages that transfer random pieces of the producing cell's genome to recipient cells. the best-studied gta is that of rhodobacter capsulatus, termed rcgta. we discovered that the putative response regulator ctra, which is essential for rcgta production, is required for rcgta-mediated gene acquisition,  and confirmed that a reca homologue is required. it was also discovered that a dpra (dna-protecting protein a) homologue is essential for rcgta-mediated gene acquisition, and that dpra expression is induced by gtai-dependent quorum-sensing and non-phosphorylated ctra. modelling of the r. capsulatus dpra structure indicated the presence of a c-terminal region that resembles a dsdna-binding protein domain. purified his-tagged r. capsulatus dpra protein bound to both single-stranded (ss)dna and double-stranded (ds)dna, but with a greater affinity  for ssdna. additionally, dpra protected dsdna from endonuclease digestion, and increased the rate of nucleation of escherichia coli reca onto ssdna. single-cell expression analyses revealed that dpra is expressed in the majority of cells throughout a population. overall, the results suggest that incorporation of rcgta dna into the recipient cell genome proceeds through a homologous recombination pathway resembling dna recombination in natural transformation.

TI  == transport of nickel and cobalt ions into bacterial cells by s components of ecf transporters.
AB  == energy-coupling factor (ecf) transporters form a distinct group of abc-type micronutrient importers in prokaryotes that do not contain extracytoplasmic, soluble substrate-binding proteins. instead, they consist of a transmembrane substrate-specific s component that interacts with a module composed of a moderately conserved transmembrane (t) component and abc atpases. the majority of s components is considered to act as high-affinity binding proteins that strictly depend on their cognate t and atpase units for transport activity. for a fraction of biotin-specific s units, however, transport activity was demonstrated in their solitary state. here, we compared the activities of nickel- and cobalt-specific ecf transporters in the presence and absence of their t and atpase units. accumulation assays with radioactive metal ions showed that the truncated transporters led to approx. 25% of cell-bound radioactivity compared to the holotransporters. activity of urease, an intracellular nickel-dependent enzyme, was used as a reporter and clearly indicated that the cell-bound radioactivity correlates with the cytoplasmic metal concentration. the results demonstrate that s units of metal transporters not only bind their substrates on the cell surface  but mediate transport across the membrane, a finding of general importance on the way to understand the mechanism of ecf transporters.

TI  == the chaperone fdsc for rhodobacter capsulatus formate dehydrogenase binds the bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor.
AB  == molybdoenzymes are complex enzymes in which the molybdenum cofactor (moco) is deeply buried in the enzyme. most molybdoenzymes contain a specific chaperone for the insertion of moco. for the formate dehydrogenase fdsgba from rhodobacter capsulatus the two chaperones fdsc and fdsd were identified to be essential for enzyme activity, but are not a subunit of the mature enzyme. here, we purified and characterized the fdsc protein after heterologous expression in escherichia coli. we were able to copurify fdsc with the bound moco derivate bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide. this cofactor successfully was used as a  source to reconstitute the activity of molybdoenzymes.

TI  == the oxygen-tolerant and nad+-dependent formate dehydrogenase from rhodobacter capsulatus is able to catalyze the reduction of co2 to formate.
AB  == the formate dehydrogenase from rhodobacter capsulatus (rcfdh) is an oxygen-tolerant protein with an (alphabetagamma)2 subunit composition that is localized in the cytoplasm. it belongs to the group of metal and nad(+)-dependent fdhs with the coordination of a molybdenum cofactor, four [fe4s4] clusters and one [fe2s2] cluster associated with the alpha-subunit, one [fe4s4] cluster and one fmn bound to the beta-subunit, and one [fe2s2] cluster bound to the gamma-subunit. rcfdh was heterologously expressed in escherichia coli and characterized. cofactor analysis showed that the bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor is bound to the fdsa subunit containing a cysteine ligand at the active site. a turnover rate of 2189 min(-1) with formate as substrate was determined. the back reaction for the reduction of co2 was catalyzed with a k(cat) of 89 min(-1). the preference for formate oxidation shows an energy barrier for co2 reduction of the enzyme. furthermore, the fmn-containing and [fe4s4]-containing beta-subunit together with the [fe2s2]-containing gamma-subunit forms a diaphorase unit with activities for both nad(+) reduction and nadh oxidation. in addition to the structural genes fdsg, fdsb, and fdsa, the fds operon in r. capsulatus contains the fdsc and fdsd genes. expression studies  showed that rcfdh is only active when both fdsc and fdsd are present. both proteins are proposed to be involved in bis-molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide modification and insertion into rcfdh.

TI  == phosphate concentration and the putative sensor kinase protein ccka modulate cell lysis and release of the rhodobacter capsulatus gene transfer agent.
AB  == the gene transfer agent of rhodobacter capsulatus (rcgta) is a bacteriophage-like genetic element with the sole known function of horizontal gene transfer. homologues of rcgta genes are present in many members of the alphaproteobacteria  and may serve an important role in microbial evolution. transcription of rcgta genes is induced as cultures enter the stationary phase; however, little is known about cis-active sequences. in this work, we identify the promoter of the first gene in the rcgta structural gene cluster. additionally, gene transduction frequency depends on the growth medium, and the reason for this is not known. we  report that millimolar concentrations of phosphate posttranslationally inhibit the lysis-dependent release of rcgta from cells in both a complex medium and a defined medium. furthermore, we found that cell lysis requires the genes rcc00555 and rcc00556, which were expressed and studied in escherichia coli to determine their predicted functions as an endolysin and holin, respectively. production of  rcgta is regulated by host systems, including a putative histidine kinase, ccka,  and we found that ccka is required for maximal expression of rcc00555 and for maturation of rcgta to yield gene transduction-functional particles.

TI  == nicotinamide is a specific inhibitor of dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, a nitrogenase-like enzyme, from rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (dpor) is a nitrogenase-like enzyme consisting of two components, l-protein as a reductase component and nb-protein as a catalytic component. elucidation of the crystal structures of nb-protein (muraki et al., nature 2010, 465: 110-114) has enabled us to study its reaction mechanism in combination with biochemical analysis. here we demonstrate  that nicotinamide (na) inhibits dpor activity by blocking the electron transfer from l-protein to nb-protein. a reaction scheme of dpor, in which the binding of  protochlorophyllide (pchlide) to the nb-protein precedes the electron transfer from the l-protein, is proposed based on the na effects.

TI  == iron and copper act synergistically to delay anaerobic growth of bacteria.
AB  == transition metals are known to cause toxic effects through their interaction with oxygen, but toxicity under anoxic conditions is poorly understood. here we investigated the effects of iron (fe) and copper (cu) on the anaerobic growth and gene expression of the purple phototrophic bacterium rhodopseudomonas palustris tie-1. we found that fe(ii) and cu(ii) act synergistically to delay anaerobic growth at environmentally relevant metal concentrations. cu(i) and cu(ii) had similar effects both alone and in the presence of ascorbate, a cu(ii) reductant,  indicating that reduction of cu(ii) to cu(i) by fe(ii) is not sufficient to explain the growth inhibition. addition of cu(ii) increased the toxicity of co(ii) and ni(ii); in contrast, ni(ii) toxicity was diminished in the presence of fe(ii). the synergistic anaerobic toxicity of fe(ii) and cu(ii) was also observed for escherichia coli mg1655, shewanella oneidensis mr-1, and rhodobacter capsulatus sb1003. gene expression analyses for r. palustris identified three regulatory genes that respond to cu(ii) and not to fe(ii): homologs of cuer and cusr, two known proteobacterial copper homeostasis regulators, and csor, a copper regulator recently identified in mycobacterium tuberculosis. two p-type atpase efflux pumps, along with an f(o)f(1) atp synthase, were also upregulated by cu(ii) but not by fe(ii). an escherichia coli mutant deficient in copa, cus, and  cueo showed a smaller synergistic effect, indicating that iron might interfere with one or more of the copper homeostasis systems. our results suggest that interactive effects of transition metals on microbial physiology may be widespread under anoxic conditions, although the molecular mechanisms remain to be more fully elucidated.

TI  == heterologous carotenoid-biosynthetic enzymes: functional complementation and effects on carotenoid profiles in escherichia coli.
AB  == a limited number of carotenoid pathway genes from microbial sources have been studied for analyzing the pathway complementation in the heterologous host escherichia coli. in order to systematically investigate the functionality of carotenoid pathway enzymes in e. coli, the pathway genes of carotenogenic microorganisms (brevibacterium linens, corynebacterium glutamicum, rhodobacter sphaeroides, rhodobacter capsulatus, rhodopirellula baltica, and pantoea ananatis) were modified to form synthetic expression modules and then were complemented with pantoea agglomerans pathway enzymes (crte, crtb, crti, crty, and crtz). the carotenogenic pathway enzymes in the synthetic modules showed unusual activities when complemented with e. coli. for example, the expression of heterologous crtes of b. linens, c. glutamicum, and r. baltica influenced p. agglomerans crti to convert its substrate phytoene into a rare product-3,4,3',4'-tetradehydrolycopene-along with lycopene, which was an expected product, indicating that crte, the first enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, can influence carotenoid profiles. in addition, crtis of r. sphaeroides  and r. capsulatus converted phytoene into an unusual lycopene as well as into neurosporene. thus, this study shows that the functional complementation of pathway enzymes from different sources is a useful methodology for diversifying biosynthesis as nature does.

TI  == photokinetic, biochemical and structural features of chimeric photoactive yellow  protein constructs.
AB  == of the 10 photoactive yellow protein (pyps) that have been characterized, the two from rhodobacter species are the only ones that have an additional intermediate spectral form in the resting state (lambdamax = 375 nm), compared to the prototypical halorhodospira halophila pyp. we have constructed three chimeric pyp proteins by replacing the first 21 residues from the n-terminus (hyb1pyp), 10 from the beta4-beta5 loop (hyb2pyp) and both (hyb3pyp) in hhal pyp with those from rb. capsulatus pyp. the n-terminal chimera behaves both spectrally and kinetically like hhal pyp, indicating that the rcaps n-terminus folds against the core of hhal pyp. a small fraction shows dimerization and slower recovery, possibly due to interaction at the n-termini. the loop chimera has a small amount of the intermediate spectral form and a photocycle that is 20 000 times slower than hhal pyp. the third chimera, with both regions exchanged, resembles rcaps pyp with a significant amount of intermediate spectral form (lambdamax = 380 nm), but has even slower kinetics. the effects are not strictly additive in the double chimera, suggesting that what perturbs one site, affects the other as well. these chimeras suggest that the intermediate spectral form has its origins in overall protein stability and solvent exposure.

TI  == functional assignment of gene aac16202.1 from rhodobacter capsulatus sb1003: new  insights into the bacterial sdr sorbitol dehydrogenases family.
AB  == short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (sdr) constitute one of the largest enzyme  superfamilies with over 60,000 non-redundant sequences in the database, many of which need a correct functional assignment. among them, the gene aac16202.1 (ncbi) from rhodobacter capsulatus sb1003 has been assigned in uniprot both as a  sorbitol dehydrogenase (#d5auy1) and, as an n-acetyl-d-mannosamine dehydrogenase  (#o66112), both enzymes being of biotechnological interest. when the gene was overexpressed in escherichia coli rosetta (de3)plys, the purified enzyme was not  active toward n-acetyl-d-mannosamine, whereas it was active toward d-sorbitol and d-fructose. however, the relative activities toward xylitol and l-iditol (0.45 and 6.9%, respectively) were low compared with that toward d-sorbitol. thus, the  enzyme could be considered sorbitol dehydrogenase (sdh) with very low activity toward xylitol, which could increase its biotechnological interest for determining sorbitol without the unspecific cross-determination of added xylitol  in food and pharma compositions. the tetrameric enzyme (120 kda) showed similar catalytic efficiency (2.2 x 10(3) m(-1) s(-1)) to other sorbitol dehydrogenases for d-sorbitol, with an optimum ph of 9.0 and an optimum temperature of 37 degrees c. the enzyme was also more thermostable than other reported sdh, ammonium sulfate being the best stabilizer in this respect, increasing the melting temperature (t(m)) up to 52.9 degrees c. the enzyme can also be considered as a new member of the zn(2+) independent sdh family since no effect on activity was detected in the presence of divalent cations or chelating agents. finally, its in silico analysis enabled the specific conserved sequence blocks that are the fingerprints of bacterial sorbitol dehydrogenases and mainly located at c-terminal of the protein, to be determined for the first time. this knowledge will facilitate future data curation of present databases and a better functional assignment of newly described sequences.

TI  == essential amino acid residues of bioy reveal that dimers are the functional s unit of the rhodobacter capsulatus biotin transporter.
AB  == energy-coupling factor transporters are a large group of importers for trace nutrients in prokaryotes. the in vivo oligomeric state of their substrate-specific transmembrane proteins (s units) is a matter of debate. here we focus on the s unit bioy of rhodobacter capsulatus, which functions as a low-affinity biotin transporter in its solitary state. to analyze whether oligomerization is a requirement for function, a tail-to-head-linked bioy dimer was constructed. monomeric and dimeric bioy conferred comparable biotin uptake activities on recombinant escherichia coli. fluorophore-tagged variants of the dimer were shown by fluorescence anisotropy analysis to oligomerize in vivo. quantitative mass spectrometry identified biotin in the purified proteins at a stoichiometry of 1:2 for the bioy monomer and 1:4 (referring to single bioy domains) for the dimer. replacement of the conserved asp164 (by asn) and lys167 (by arg or gln) in the monomer and in both halves of the dimer inactivated the proteins. the presence of those mutations in one half of the dimers only slightly affected biotin binding but reduced transport activity to 25% (asp164asn and lys167arg) or 75% (lys167gln). our data (i) suggest that intermolecular interactions of domains from different dimers provide functionality, (ii) confirm an oligomeric architecture of bioy in living cells, and (iii) demonstrate an essential role of the last transmembrane helix in biotin recognition.

TI  == biosynthesis of caffeic acid in escherichia coli using its endogenous hydroxylase complex.
AB  == background: caffeic acid (3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid) is a natural phenolic compound derived from the plant phenylpropanoid pathway. caffeic acid and its phenethyl ester (cape) have attracted increasing attention for their various pharmaceutical properties and health-promoting effects. nowadays, large-scale production of drugs or drug precursors via microbial approaches provides a promising alternative to chemical synthesis and extraction from plant sources. results: we first identified that an escherichia coli native hydroxylase complex  previously characterized as the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase (4hpa3h) was able to convert p-coumaric acid to caffeic acid efficiently. this critical enzymatic step catalyzed in plants by a membrane-associated cytochrome p450 enzyme, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase (c3h), is difficult to be functionally expressed in prokaryotic systems. moreover, the performances of two tyrosine ammonia lyases (tals) from rhodobacter species were compared after overexpression in e. coli. the results indicated that the tal from r. capsulatus (rc) possesses  higher activity towards both tyrosine and l-dopa. based on these findings, we further designed a dual pathway leading from tyrosine to caffeic acid consisting  of the enzymes 4hpa3h and rctal. this heterologous pathway extended e. coli native tyrosine biosynthesis machinery and was able to produce caffeic acid (12.1 mg/l) in minimal salt medium. further improvement in production was accomplished  by boosting tyrosine biosynthesis in e. coli, which involved the alleviation of tyrosine-induced feedback inhibition and carbon flux redirection. finally, the titer of caffeic acid reached 50.2 mg/l in shake flasks after 48-hour cultivation. conclusion: we have successfully established a novel pathway and constructed an e. coli strain for the production of caffeic acid. this work forms a basis for further improvement in production, as well as opens the possibility of microbial synthesis of more complex plant secondary metabolites derived from caffeic acid. in addition, we have identified that tal is the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. thus, exploration for more active tals via bio-prospecting and protein engineering approaches is necessary for further improvement of caffeic acid production.

TI  == a t7 rna polymerase-based toolkit for the concerted expression of clustered genes.
AB  == bacterial genes whose enzymes are either assembled into complex multi-domain proteins or form biosynthetic pathways are frequently organized within large chromosomal clusters. the functional expression of clustered genes, however, remains challenging since it generally requires an expression system that facilitates the coordinated transcription of numerous genes irrespective of their natural promoters and terminators. here, we report on the development of a novel  expression system that is particularly suitable for the homologous expression of  multiple genes organized in a contiguous cluster. the new expression toolkit consists of an omega interposon cassette carrying a t7 rna polymerase specific promoter which is designed for promoter tagging of clustered genes and a small set of broad-host-range plasmids providing the respective polymerase in different bacteria. the uptake hydrogenase gene locus of the photosynthetic non-sulfur purple bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus which consists of 16 genes was used as an example to demonstrate functional expression only by t7 rna polymerase but not by bacterial rna polymerase. our findings clearly indicate that due to its unique properties t7 rna polymerase can be applied for overexpression of large and complex bacterial gene regions.

TI  == heterologous high-level gene expression in the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the functional expression of heterologous genes in standard hosts such as escherichia coli is often hampered by various limitations including improper folding, incomplete targeting, and missassembly of the corresponding enzymes. this observation led to the development of numerous expression systems that are based on alternative, metabolic versatile hosts. one such organism is the gram-negative phototrophic nonsulfur purple bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus. during photosynthetic growth, r. capsulatus exhibits several unique properties including the formation of an intracytoplasmic membrane system as well as the synthesis of various metal-containing cofactors. these properties make r. capsulatus a promising expression host particularly suited for difficult-to-express proteins such as membrane proteins. in this chapter, we describe a novel r. capsulatus expression system and its application.

TI  == insights into structure and function of the active site of soxax cytochromes.
AB  == soxax cytochromes catalyze the formation of heterodisulfide bonds between inorganic sulfur compounds and a carrier protein, soxyz. they contain unusual his/cys-ligated heme groups with complex spectroscopic signatures. the heme-ligating cysteine has been implicated in soxax catalysis, but neither the soxax spectroscopic properties nor its catalysis are fully understood at present. we have solved the first crystal structure for a group 2 soxax protein (snsoxax), where an n-terminal extension of soxx forms a novel structure that supports dimer formation. crystal structures of soxax with a heme ligand substitution (c236m) uncovered an inherent flexibility of this soxa heme site, with both bonding distances and relative ligand orientation differing between asymmetric units and  the new residue, met(236), representing an unusual rotamer of methionine. the flexibility of the snsoxax(c236m) soxa heme environment is probably the cause of  the four distinct, new epr signals, including a high spin ferric heme form, that  were observed for the enzyme. despite the removal of the catalytically active cysteine heme ligand and drastic changes in the redox potential of the soxa heme  (wt, -479 mv; c236m, +85 mv), the substituted enzyme was catalytically active in  glutathione-based assays although with reduced turnover numbers (wt, 3.7 s(-1); c236m, 2.0 s(-1)). snsoxax(c236m) was also active in assays using soxyz and thiosulfate as the sulfur substrate, suggesting that cys(236) aids catalysis but  is not crucial for it. the soxyz-based soxax assay is the first assay for an isolated component of the sox multienzyme system.

TI  == loss of a conserved tyrosine residue of cytochrome b induces reactive oxygen species production by cytochrome bc1.
AB  == production of reactive oxygen species (ros) induces oxidative damages, decreases  cellular energy conversion efficiencies, and induces metabolic diseases in humans. during respiration, cytochrome bc(1) efficiently oxidizes hydroquinone to quinone, but how it performs this reaction without any leak of electrons to o(2)  to yield ros is not understood. using the bacterial enzyme, here we show that a conserved tyr residue of the cytochrome b subunit of cytochrome bc(1) is critical for this process. substitution of this residue with other amino acids decreases cytochrome bc(1) activity and enhances ros production. moreover, the tyr to cys mutation cross-links together the cytochrome b and iron-sulfur subunits and renders the bacterial enzyme sensitive to o(2) by oxidative disruption of its catalytic [2fe-2s] cluster. hence, this tyr residue is essential in controlling unproductive encounters between o(2) and catalytic intermediates at the quinol oxidation site of cytochrome bc(1) to prevent ros generation. remarkably, the same tyr to cys mutation is encountered in humans with mitochondrial disorders and in plasmodium species that are resistant to the anti-malarial drug atovaquone. these findings illustrate the harmful consequences of this mutation in human diseases.

TI  == control of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis by ftsh-mediated proteolysis of lpxc is conserved in enterobacteria but not in all gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == despite the essential function of lipopolysaccharides (lps) in gram-negative bacteria, it is largely unknown how the exact amount of this molecule in the outer membrane is controlled. the first committed step in lps biosynthesis is catalyzed by the lpxc enzyme. in escherichia coli, the cellular concentration of  lpxc is adjusted by the only essential protease in this organism, the membrane-anchored metalloprotease ftsh. turnover of e. coli lpxc requires a length- and sequence-specific c-terminal degradation signal. lpxc proteins from salmonella, yersinia, and vibrio species carry similar c-terminal ends and, like  the e. coli enzyme, were degraded by ftsh. although lpxc proteins are highly conserved in gram-negative bacteria, there are striking differences in their c termini. the aquifex aeolicus enzyme, which is devoid of the c-terminal extension, was stable in e. coli, whereas lpxc from the alphaproteobacteria agrobacterium tumefaciens and rhodobacter capsulatus was degraded by the lon protease. proteolysis of the a. tumefaciens protein required the c-terminal end of lpxc. high stability of pseudomonas aeruginosa lpxc in e. coli and p. aeruginosa suggested that pseudomonas uses a proteolysis-independent strategy to  control its lps content. the differences in lpxc turnover along with previously reported differences in susceptibility against antimicrobial compounds have important implications for the potential of lpxc as a drug target.

TI  == maltose-neopentyl glycol (mng) amphiphiles for solubilization, stabilization and  crystallization of membrane proteins.
AB  == the understanding of integral membrane protein (imp) structure and function is hampered by the difficulty of handling these proteins. aqueous solubilization, necessary for many types of biophysical analysis, generally requires a detergent  to shield the large lipophilic surfaces of native imps. many proteins remain difficult to study owing to a lack of suitable detergents. we introduce a class of amphiphiles, each built around a central quaternary carbon atom derived from neopentyl glycol, with hydrophilic groups derived from maltose. representatives of this maltose-neopentyl glycol (mng) amphiphile family show favorable behavior  relative to conventional detergents, as manifested in multiple membrane protein systems, leading to enhanced structural stability and successful crystallization. mng amphiphiles are promising tools for membrane protein science because of the ease with which they may be prepared and the facility with which their structures may be varied.

TI  == the putative assembly factor ccoh is stably associated with the cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase.
AB  == cytochrome oxidases are perfect model substrates for analyzing the assembly of multisubunit complexes because the need for cofactor incorporation adds an additional level of complexity to their assembly. cbb(3)-type cytochrome c oxidases (cbb(3)-cox) consist of the catalytic subunit ccon, the membrane-bound c-type cytochrome subunits ccoo and ccop, and the ccoq subunit, which is required for cbb(3)-cox stability. biogenesis of cbb(3)-cox proceeds via ccoqp and ccono subcomplexes, which assemble into the active cbb(3)-cox. most bacteria expressing cbb(3)-cox also contain the ccoghis genes, which encode putative cbb(3)-cox assembly factors. their exact function, however, has remained unknown. here we analyzed the role of ccoh in cbb(3)-cox assembly and showed that ccoh is a single spanning-membrane protein with an n-terminus-out-c-terminus-in (n(out)-c(in)) topology. in its absence, neither the fully assembled cbb(3)-cox nor the ccoqp or ccono subcomplex was detectable. by chemical cross-linking, we demonstrated that  ccoh binds primarily via its transmembrane domain to the ccop subunit of cbb(3)-cox. a second hydrophobic stretch, which is located at the c terminus of ccoh, appears not to be required for contacting ccop, but deleting it prevents the formation of the active cbb(3)-cox. this suggests that the second hydrophobic domain is required for merging the ccono and ccopq subcomplexes into the active cbb(3)-cox. surprisingly, ccoh does not seem to interact only transiently with the cbb(3)-cox but appears to stay tightly associated with the active, fully assembled complex. thus, ccoh behaves more like a bona fide subunit of the cbb(3)-cox than an assembly factor per se.

AB  == ecf-class transporters comprise abundant importers for micronutrients such as vitamins and transition-metal ions, and for intermediates of salvage pathways in  bacteria and archaea. they are composed of abc atpases (a units), a conserved transmembrane protein (t unit) and a substrate-specific transmembrane protein (s  unit or core transporter). here we analyzed the function of an ecf-type co(2+) transporter (cbimnqo) and, in particular, the derived bipartite s unit cbimn. cbimn was characterized as the minimal unit that functions as a co(2+) transporter. neither the solitary cbim nor a tripartite cbimqo complex was active, indicating an essential role for cbin. cbin was loosely bound in cbimnqo  and cbimn complexes, and did not copurify with its partners. generating a contiguous reading frame resulted in a cbi(mn) fusion protein that displayed co(2+)-transport activity and interacted with cbiqo in vivo. sixteen variants of  cbi(mn) with modifications in the strongly conserved n-terminal stretch of ten amino-acid residues were constructed and analyzed for transport activity. the results indicate that the length and sequence of this region are critical for functioning of the core transporter. specifically, they point to essential roles  of his(2) and the distance of his(2) to the amino group of the peptide chain in metal recognition.

TI  == ctpa, a copper-translocating p-type atpase involved in the biogenesis of multiple copper-requiring enzymes.
AB  == the ctpa (ccoi) gene product, a putative inner membrane copper-translocating p1b-type atpase present in many bacteria, has been shown to be involved only in the cbb(3) assembly in rhodobacter capsulatus and bradyrhizobium japonicum. ctpa  was disrupted in rubrivivax gelatinosus, and the mutants showed a drastic decrease in both cbb(3) and caa(3) oxidase activities. inactivation of ctpa results also in a decrease in the amount of the nitrous oxide reductase, nosz. this pleiotropic phenotype could be partially rescued by excess copper in the medium, indicating that ctpa is likely a copper transporter that supplies copper-requiring proteins in the membrane with this metal. although ctpa shares significant sequence homologies with the homeostasis copper efflux p1b-type atpases including the bacterial copa and the human atp7a and atp7b, disruption of ctpa did not result in any sensitivity to excess copper. this indicates that the  ctpa is not crucial for copper tolerance but is involved in the assembly of membrane and periplasmic copper enzymes in this bacterium. the potential roles of ctpa in bacteria in comparison with copa are discussed.

TI  == targeting the active site gate to yield hyperactive variants of 5-aminolevulinate synthase.
AB  == the rate of porphyrin biosynthesis in mammals is controlled by the activity of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ec 2.3.1.37). based on the postulate that turnover in this enzyme is controlled by conformational dynamics associated with a highly conserved active site loop, we constructed a variant library by targeting imperfectly conserved noncatalytic loop residues and examined the effects on product and porphyrin production. functional loop variants of the enzyme were isolated via genetic complementation  in escherichia coli strain hu227. colony porphyrin fluorescence varied widely when bacterial cells harboring the loop variants were grown on inductive media; this facilitated identification of clones encoding unusually active enzyme variants. nine loop variants leading to high in vivo porphyrin production were purified and characterized kinetically. steady state catalytic efficiencies for the two substrates were increased by up to 100-fold. presteady state single turnover reaction data indicated that the second step of quinonoid intermediate decay, previously assigned as reaction rate-limiting, was specifically accelerated such that in three of the variants this step was no longer kinetically significant. overall, our data support the postulate that the active  site loop controls the rate of product and porphyrin production in vivo and suggest the possibility of an as yet undiscovered means of allosteric regulation.

TI  == a new system for heterologous expression of membrane proteins: rhodospirillum rubrum.
AB  == heterologous expression of membrane proteins has met with only limited success. this work presents a new host/vector system for the production of heterologous membrane proteins based on a mutant of the facultatively phototrophic bacterium rhodospirillum rubrum. under certain growth conditions, r. rubrum forms an intracytoplasmic membrane (icm) that houses the photosynthetic apparatus, the structural proteins of which are encoded by puha and pufbalm. the mutant r. rubrum h2, which was constructed by allelic exchange deleting puha and pufbalm, does not form icm. this strain was used as a host for a plasmid expressing the pseudomonas aeruginosa membrane protein mscl from the rhodobacter capsulatus puc  promoter. icm was formed in the h2 strain producing mscl but not in the vector control strain. these results suggest that a heterologous membrane protein stimulates icm formation in r. rubrum and indicate that the capacity to form an icm that can accommodate heterologous proteins makes r. rubrum a host that will be useful for membrane protein production. p. aeruginosa mscl, which forms inclusion bodies when produced in escherichia coli, was expressed in r. rubrum h2 and purified from membranes with a yield of 22.8-23.4 mg/l culture (5.53-5.60 mg/g cell paste). additionally streptomyces lividans kcsa and p. aeruginosa cycb  were produced and purified from r. rubrum h2 with yields of 13.7-14.4 mg/l culture (2.19-2.55 mg/g cell paste) and 6.6-7.4 mg/l culture (1.1-1.2mg/g cell paste), respectively.

TI  == a novel t7 rna polymerase dependent expression system for high-level protein production in the phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the functional expression of heterologous genes using standard bacterial expression hosts such as escherichia coli is often limited, e.g. by incorrect folding, assembly or targeting of recombinant proteins. consequently, alternative bacterial expression systems have to be developed to provide novel strategies for protein synthesis exceeding the repertoire of the standard expression host e. coli. here, we report on the construction of a novel expression system that combines the high processivity of t7 rna polymerase with the unique physiological properties of the facultative photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus. this system basically consists of a recombinant r. capsulatus t7 expression strain (r. capsulatus b10s-t7) harboring the respective polymerase gene under control of a fructose inducible promoter. in addition, a set of different broad-host-range vectors (prho) was constructed allowing t7 rna polymerase dependent and independent target gene expression in r. capsulatus and other gram-negative bacteria. the expression efficiency of the novel system was studied in r. capsulatus and e. coli using the yellow fluorescent protein (yfp) as model  protein. expression levels were comparable in both expression hosts and yielded up to 80mg/l yfp in phototrophically grown r. capsulatus cultures. this result clearly indicates that the novel r. capsulatus-based expression system is well suited for the high-level expression of soluble proteins.

TI  == site directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues at the active site of mouse aldehyde oxidase aox1.
AB  == mouse aldehyde oxidase (maox1) forms a homodimer and belongs to the xanthine oxidase family of molybdoenzymes which are characterized by an essential equatorial sulfur ligand coordinated to the molybdenum atom. in general, mammalian aos are characterized by broad substrate specificity and an yet obscure physiological function. to define the physiological substrates and the enzymatic  characteristics of maox1, we established a system for the heterologous expression of the enzyme in escherichia coli. the recombinant protein showed spectral features and a range of substrate specificity similar to the native protein purified from mouse liver. the epr data of recombinant maox1 were similar to those of ao from rabbit liver, but differed from the homologous xanthine oxidoreductase enzymes. site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids val806, met884 and glu1265 at the active site resulted in a drastic decrease in the oxidation of aldehydes with no increase in the oxidation of purine substrates. the double mutant v806e/m884r and the single mutant e1265q were catalytically inactive enzymes regardless of the aldehyde or purine substrates tested. our results show  that only glu1265 is essential for the catalytic activity by initiating the base-catalyzed mechanism of substrate oxidation. in addition, it is concluded that the substrate specificity of molybdo-flavoenzymes is more complex and not only defined by the three characterized amino acids in the active site.

TI  == rna degradation in archaea and gram-negative bacteria different from escherichia  coli.
AB  == exoribonucleolytic and endoribonucleolytic activities are important for controlled degradation of rna and contribute to the regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by influencing the half-lives of specific messenger rnas. the rna half-lives are determined by the characteristics of the rna substrates and by the availability and the properties of the involved proteins-ribonucleases and assisting polypeptides. much is known about rna degradation in eukarya and bacteria, but there is limited information about rna-degrading enzymes and rna destabilizing or stabilizing elements in the domain of the archaea. the recent progress in the understanding of the structure and function of the archaeal exosome, a protein complex with rna-degrading and rna-tailing capabilities, has given some first insights into the mechanisms of rna degradation in the third domain of life and into the evolution of rna-degrading enzymes. moreover, other archaeal rnases with degrading potential have been described and a new mechanism for protection of the 5'-end of rna in archaea was discovered. here, we summarize the current knowledge on rna degradation in the archaea. additionally, rna degradation mechanisms in rhodobacter capsulatus and pseudomonas syringae are compared to those in the major model organism for gram-negatives, escherichia coli, which dominates our view on rna degradation in bacteria.

TI  == catalytic properties of the expressed acyclic carotenoid 2-ketolases from rhodobacter capsulatus and rubrivivax gelatinosus.
AB  == purple photosynthetic bacteria synthesize the acyclic carotenoids spheroidene and spirilloxanthin which are ketolated to spheroidenone and 2,2'-diketospirilloxanthin under aerobic growth. for the studies of the catalytic reaction of the ketolating enzyme, the crta genes from rubrivivax gelatinosus and rhodobacter capsulatus encoding acyclic carotenoid 2-ketolases were expressed in  escherichia coli to functional enzymes. with the purified enzyme from the latter, the requirement of molecular oxygen and reduced ferredoxin for the catalytic activity was determined. furthermore, the putative intermediate 2-ho-spheroidene  was in vitro converted to the corresponding 2-keto product. therefore, a monooxygenase mechanism involving two consecutive hydroxylation steps at c-2 were proposed for this enzyme. by functional pathway complementation studies in e. coli and enzyme kinetic studies, the product specificity of both enzymes were investigated. it appears that the ketolases could catalyze most intermediates and products of the spheroidene and spirilloxanthin pathway. this was also the case for the enzyme from rba. capsulatus from which spirilloxanthin synthesis is absent. in general, the ketolase of rvi. gelatinosus had a better specificity for spheroidene, ho-spheroidene and spirilloxanthin as substrates than the ketolase from rba. capsulatus.

TI  == intrinsic uncoupling in the atp synthase of escherichia coli.
AB  == the atp hydrolysis activity and proton pumping of the atp synthase of escherichia coli in isolated native membranes have been measured and compared as a function of adp and pi concentration. the atp hydrolysis activity was inhibited by pi with an half-maximal effect at 140 microm, which increased progressively up in the millimolar range when the adp concentration was progressively decreased by increasing amounts of an adp trap. in addition, the relative extent of this inhibition decreased with decreasing adp. the half-maximal inhibition by adp was  found in the submicromolar range, and the extent of inhibition was enhanced by the presence of pi. the parallel measurement of atp hydrolysis activity and proton pumping indicated that, while the rate of atp hydrolysis was decreased as  a function of either ligand, the rate of proton pumping increased. the latter showed a biphasic response to the concentration of pi, in which an inhibition followed the initial stimulation. similarly as previously found for the atp synthase from rhodobacter caspulatus [p. turina, d. giovannini, f. gubellini, b.a. melandri, physiological ligands adp and pi modulate the degree of intrinsic  coupling in the atp synthase of the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus, biochemistry 43 (2004) 11126-11134], these data indicate that the e.  coli atp synthase can operate at different degrees of energetic coupling between  hydrolysis and proton transport, which are modulated by adp and pi.

AB  == dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (dpor) is a nitrogenase-like enzyme catalyzing d-ring reduction of protochlorophyllide in chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis. dpor consists of two components, l-protein and  nb-protein, which are structurally related to nitrogenase fe-protein and mofe-protein, respectively. neither fe-protein nor mofe-protein is expressed as an active form in escherichia coli due to the requirement of many nif proteins for the assembly of the metallocenter and the maturation specific for diazotrophs. here we report the functional expression of dpor components from rhodobacter capsulatus in escherichia coli. two overexpression plasmids for l-protein and nb-protein were constructed. l-protein and nb-protein purified from e. coli showed spectroscopic properties similar to those purified from r. capsulatus. l-protein and nb-protein activities were evaluated using a crude extract of e. coli overexpressing nb-protein and l-protein, respectively. specific activities of the purified l-protein and nb-protein were 219+/-38 and 52.8+/-5.5 nmolchlorophyllide min(-1) mg(-1), respectively, which were even higher than those of l-protein and nb-protein purified from r. capsulatus. these  e. coli strains provide a promising system for structural and kinetic analyses of the nitrogenase-like enzymes.

TI  == compensatory thio-redox interactions between dsba, ccda and ccmg unveil the apocytochrome c holdase role of ccmg during cytochrome c maturation.
AB  == during cytochrome c maturation (ccm), the dsba-dependent thio-oxidative protein-folding pathway is thought to introduce a disulphide bond into the haem-binding motif of apocytochromes c. this disulphide bond is believed to be reduced through a thio-reductive pathway involving the ccm components ccda (dsbd), ccmg and ccmh. here, we show in rhodobacter capsulatus that in the absence of dsba cytochrome c levels were decreased and ccda or ccmg or the putative glutathione transporter cyddc was not needed for ccm. this decrease was  not due to overproduction of the periplasmic protease degp as a secondary effect  of dsba absence. in contrast, ccmh was absolutely necessary regardless of dsba, indicating that compensatory thio-redox interactions excluded it. remarkably, the double (dsba-ccmg) and triple (dsba-ccmg-ccda) mutants produced cytochromes c at  lower levels than the dsba-null mutants, unless they contained a ccmg derivative  (ccmg*) lacking its thio-reductive activity. purified ccmg* can bind apocytochrome c in vitro, revealing for the first time a thiol-independent, direct interaction between apocytochrome c and ccmg. furthermore, elimination of  the thio-redox components does not abolish cytochrome c production, restricting the number of ccm components essential for haem-apocyt c ligation per se during ccm.

TI  == photoactive yellow protein from the halophilic bacterium salinibacter ruber.
AB  == a gene for photoactive yellow protein (pyp) was identified from the genome sequence of the extremely halophilic aerobic bacterium salinibacter ruber (sr). the sequence is distantly related to the prototypic pyp from halorhodospira halophila (hh) (37% identity) and contains most of the amino acid residues identified as necessary for function. however, the sr pyp gene is not flanked by  its two biosynthetic genes as in other species. to determine as to whether the sr pyp gene encodes a functional protein, we cloned and expressed it in escherichia  coli, along with the genes for chromophore biosynthesis from rhodobacter capsulatus. the sr pyp has a 31-residue n-terminal extension as compared to other pyps that appears to be important for dimerization; however, truncation of these  extra residues did not change the spectral and photokinetic properties. sr pyp has an absorption maximum at 431 nm, which is at shorter wavelengths than the prototypical hh pyp (at 446 nm). it is also photoactive, being reversibly bleached by either blue or white light. the kinetics of dark recovery is slower than any of the pyps reported to date (4.27 x 10(-4) s(-1) at ph 7.5). sr pyp appears to have a normal photocycle with the i1 and i2 intermediates. the presence of the i2' intermediate is also inferred on the basis of the effects of  temperature and alchohol on recovery. sr pyp has an intermediate spectral form in equilibrium with the 431 nm form, similar to r. capsulatus pyp and the y42f mutant of hh pyp. increasing ionic strength stabilizes the 431 nm form at the expense of the intermediate spectral form, and the kinetics of recovery is accelerated 6.4-fold between 0 and 3.5 m salt. this is observed with ions from both the chaotropic and the kosmotropic series. ionic strength also stabilizes pyp against thermal denaturation, as the melting temperature is increased from 74 degrees c in buffer alone to 92 degrees c in 2 m kcl. sr accumulates kcl in the cytoplasm, like halobacterium, to balance osmotic pressure and has very acidic proteins. we thus believe that sr pyp is an example of a halophilic protein that  requires kcl to electrostatically screen the excess negative charge and stabilize the tertiary structure.

TI  == overproduction or absence of the periplasmic protease degp severely compromises bacterial growth in the absence of the dithiol: disulfide oxidoreductase dsba.
AB  == facultative phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus dsba-null mutants are proficient in photosynthesis but are defective in respiration especially in enriched growth medium at 35 degrees c. they also exhibit severe pleiotropic phenotypes extending from motility defects to osmofragility and oxidative stresses. in this work, using a combined proteomics and molecular genetics approach, we demonstrated that the respiratory defect of r. capsulatus dsba-null  mutants originates from the overproduction of the periplasmic protease degp, which renders them temperature-sensitive for growth. the dsba-null mutants reverted frequently to overcome this growth defect by decreasing, but not completely eliminating, their degp activity. in agreement with these findings, we showed that overproduction of degp abolishes the newly restored respiratory growth ability of the revertants in all growth media. structural localizations of the reversion mutations in degp revealed the regions and amino acids that are important for its protease-chaperone activity. remarkably although r. capsulatus  dsba-null or degp-null mutants were viable, degp-null dsba-null double mutants were lethal at all growth temperatures. this is unlike escherichia coli, and it indicates that in the absence of dsba some degp activity is required for survival of r. capsulatus. absence of a degq protease homologue in some bacteria together  with major structural variations among the degp homologues, including a critical  disulfide bond-bearing region, correlates well with the differences seen between  various species like r. capsulatus and e. coli. our findings illustrate the occurrence of two related but distinct periplasmic protease families in bacterial species.

TI  == rhodobacter capsulatus olsa is a bifunctional enzyme active in both ornithine lipid and phosphatidic acid biosynthesis.
AB  == the rhodobacter capsulatus genome contains three genes (olsa [plsc138], plsc316,  and plsc3498) that are annotated as lysophosphatidic acid (1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate) acyltransferase (agpat). of these genes, olsa was previously shown to be an o-acyltransferase in the second step of ornithine lipid biosynthesis, which is important for optimal steady-state levels of c-type  cytochromes (s. aygun-sunar, s. mandaci, h.-g. koch, i. v. j. murray, h. goldfine, and f. daldal. mol. microbiol. 61:418-435, 2006). the roles of the remaining plsc316 and plsc3498 genes remained unknown. in this work, these genes  were cloned, and chromosomal insertion-deletion mutations inactivating them were  obtained to define their function. characterization of these mutants indicated that, unlike the escherichia coli plsc, neither plsc316 nor plsc3498 was essential in r. capsulatus. in contrast, no plsc316 olsa double mutant could be isolated, indicating that an intact copy of either olsa or plsc316 was required for r. capsulatus growth under the conditions tested. compared to olsa null mutants, plsc316 null mutants contained ornithine lipid and had no c-type cytochrome-related phenotype. however, they exhibited slight growth impairment and highly altered total fatty acid and phospholipid profiles. heterologous expression in an e. coli plsc(ts) mutant of either r. capsulatus plsc316 or olsa  gene products supported growth at a nonpermissive temperature, exhibited agpat activity in vitro, and restored phosphatidic acid biosynthesis. the more vigorous agpat activity displayed by plsc316 suggested that plsc316 encodes the main agpat required for glycerophospholipid synthesis in r. capsulatus, while olsa acts as an alternative agpat that is specific for ornithine lipid synthesis. this study therefore revealed for the first time that some olsa enzymes, like the enzyme of  r. capsulatus, are bifunctional and involved in both membrane ornithine lipid and glycerophospholipid biosynthesis.

TI  == crystal structure of an unusual thioredoxin protein with a zinc finger domain.
AB  == many gram-negative bacteria have two cytoplasmic thioredoxins, thioredoxin-1 and  -2, encoded by the trxa and trxc genes, respectively. both thioredoxins have the  highly conserved wcgpc motif and function as disulfide-bond reductases. however,  thioredoxin-2 has unique features: it has an n-terminal motif that binds a zinc ion, and its transcription is under the control of oxyr, which allows it to be up-regulated under oxidative stress. here, we report the crystal structure of thioredoxin-2 from rhodobacter capsulatus. the c-terminal region of thioredoxin-2 forms a canonical thioredoxin fold with a central beta-sheet consisting of five strands and four flanking alpha-helices on either side. the n-terminal zinc finger is composed of four short beta-strands (s1-s4) connected by three short loops (l1-l3). the four cysteines are at loops l1 and l3 and form a tetragonal binding site for a zinc ion. the zinc finger is close to the first beta-strand and first alpha-helix of the thioredoxin fold. nevertheless, the zinc finger may  not directly affect the oxidoreductase activity of thioredoxin-2 because the zinc finger is not near the active site of a protomer and because thioredoxin-2 is a monomer in solution. on the basis of structural similarity to the zinc fingers in npl4 and vps36, we propose that the n-terminal zinc finger of thioredoxin-2 mediates protein-protein interactions, possibly with its substrates or chaperones.

TI  == the highly toxic oxyanion tellurite (teo (3) (2-) ) enters the phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus via an as yet uncharacterized monocarboxylate transport system.
AB  == the facultative phototroph rhodobacter capsulatus takes up the highly toxic oxyanion tellurite when grown under both photosynthetic and respiratory growth conditions. previous works on escherichia coli and r. capsulatus suggested that tellurite uptake occurred through a phosphate transporter. here we present evidences indicating that tellurite enters r. capsulatus cells via a monocarboxylate transport system. indeed, intracellular accumulation of tellurite was inhibited by the addition of monocarboxylates such as pyruvate, lactate and acetate, but not by dicarboxylates like malate or succinate. acetate was the strongest tellurite uptake antagonist and this effect was concentration dependent, being already evident at 1 microm acetate. conversely, tellurite at 100 microm was able to restrict the acetate entry into the cells. both tellurite  and acetate uptakes were energy dependent processes, since they were abolished by the protonophore fccp and by the respiratory electron transport inhibitor kcn. interestingly, cells grown on acetate, lactate or pyruvate showed a high level resistance to tellurite, whereas cells grown on malate or succinate proved to be  very sensitive to the oxyanion. taking these data together, we propose that: (a)  tellurite enters r. capsulatus cells via an as yet uncharacterized monocarboxylate(s) transporter, (b) competition between acetate and tellurite results in a much higher level of tolerance against the oxyanion and (c) the toxic action of tellurite at the cytosolic level is significantly restricted by preventing tellurite uptake.

AB  == a tyrosine ammonia-lyase (tal) enzyme from the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides (rstal) was identified, cloned and functionally expressed in escherichia coli, where conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxycinnamic acid (phca) was demonstrated. the rstal enzyme is implicated in production of phca, which serves as the cofactor for synthesis of the photoactive yellow protein (pyp) in photosynthetic bacteria. the wild type rstal enzyme, while accepting both tyrosine and phenylalanine as substrate, prefers tyrosine, but a serendipitous rstal mutant identified during pcr amplification of the rstal gene, demonstrates much higher preference for phenylalanine as substrate and deaminates it to produces cinnamic acid. sequence analysis showed the presence of three mutations: met4 --> ile, ile325 --> val and val409 --> met in this mutant. sequence comparison with rhodobacter capsulatus tal (rctal) shows that val409 is  conserved between rctal and rstal. two single mutants of rstal, val409 --> met and val 409 --> ile, generated by site-directed mutagenesis, demonstrate greater  preference for phenylalanine compared to the wild type enzyme. our studies illustrate that relatively minor changes in the primary structure of an ammonia-lyase enzyme can significantly affect its substrate specificity.

TI  == s-adenosyl-l-methionine:magnesium-protoporphyrin ix o-methyltransferase from rhodobacter capsulatus: mechanistic insights and stimulation with phospholipids.
AB  == the enzyme bchm (s-adenosyl-l-methionine:magnesium-protoporphyrin ix o-methyltransferase) from rhodobacter capsulatus catalyses an intermediate reaction in the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. overexpression of his(6)-tagged protein in escherichia coli resulted in the majority of polypeptide existing as inclusion bodies. purification from inclusion bodies was performed using metal-affinity chromatography after an elaborate wash step involving surfactant polysorbate-20. initial enzymatic assays involved an in situ generation of s-adenosyl-l-methionine substrate using a crude preparation of s-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetase and this resulted in higher enzymatic activity compared with commercial s-adenosyl-l-methionine. a heat-stable stimulatory component present in the s-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetase was found to be a phospholipid, which increased enzymatic activity 3-4-fold. purified phospholipids also stabilized enzymatic activity and caused a disaggregation of the protein to  lower molecular mass forms, which ranged from monomeric to multimeric species as  determined by size-exclusion chromatography. there was no stimulatory effect observed with magnesium-chelatase subunits on methyltransferase activity using his-bchm that had been stabilized with phospholipids. substrate specificity of the enzyme was limited to 5-co-ordinate square-pyramidal metalloporphyrins, with  magnesium-protoporphyrin ix being the superior substrate followed by zinc-protoporphyrin ix and magnesium-deuteroporphyrin. kinetic analysis indicated a random sequential reaction mechanism. three non-substrate metalloporphyrins acted as inhibitors with different modes of inhibition exhibited with manganese iii-protoporphyrin ix (non-competitive or uncompetitive) compared with cobalt ii-protoporphyrin ix (competitive).

TI  == a beta-galactosidase-based bacterial two-hybrid system to assess protein-protein  interactions in the correct cellular environment.
AB  == the vast majority of proteins functions in complex with one or more of the same or other proteins, indicating that protein-protein interactions play crucial roles in biology. here, we present a beta-galactosidase reconstitution-based bacterial two-hybrid system in which two proteins of interest are fused to two non-functional but complementing beta-galactosidase truncations (delta alpha and  delta omega). the level of complemented beta-galactosidase activity, driven by the protein-protein recognition between both non-beta-galactosidase parts of the  chimeras, reflects whether or not the proteins of interest interact. our approach was validated by reconfirming some well-established escherichia coli cytoplasmic  and membranous interactions, including well-chosen mutants, and providing the first in vivo evidence for the transient periplasmic interaction between rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c2 and cytochrome c peroxidase. we demonstrated the major advantages of this in vivo two-hybrid technique: i) analyses of interactions are not limited to particular cellular compartments, ii) the potential of using the system in mutation-driven structure-function studies, and  iii) the possibility of its application to transiently interacting proteins. these benefits demonstrate the relevance of the method as a powerful new tool in  the broad spectrum of interaction assessment methods.

AB  == a decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsa, genbank accession no. dq191802) was cloned from rhodobacter capsulatus b10 by constructing and screening the genome library. an open reading frame of 1002 bp was revealed from sequence analysis. the deduced polypeptide consisted of 333 amino acids residues with an molecular mass of about 37 kda. the ddsa protein contained the conserved amino acid sequence (ddxxd) of e-type polyprenyl diphosphate synthase and showed high similarity to others. in contrast, ddsa showed only 39% identity to a solanesyl diphosphate synthase cloned from r. capsulatus sb1003. ddsa was expressed successfully in escherichia coli. assaying the enzyme in vivo found it made e.coli synthesize uq-10 in addition to the endogenous production uq-8.

TI  == biotin uptake in prokaryotes by solute transporters with an optional atp-binding  cassette-containing module.
AB  == biomny proteins are considered to constitute tripartite biotin transporters in prokaryotes. recent comparative genomic and experimental analyses pointed to the  similarity of biomn to homologous modules of prokaryotic transporters mediating uptake of metals, amino acids, and vitamins. these systems resemble atp-binding cassette-containing transporters and include typical atpases (e.g., biom). absence of extracytoplasmic solute-binding proteins among the members of this group, however, is a distinctive feature. genome context analyses uncovered that  only one-third of the widespread bioy genes are linked to biomn. many bioy genes  are located at loci encoding biotin biosynthesis, and others are unlinked to biotin metabolic or transport genes. heterologous expression of the biomny operon and of the single bioy of the alpha-proteobacterium rhodobacter capsulatus conferred biotin-transport activity on recombinant escherichia coli cells. kinetic analyses identified bioy as a high-capacity transporter that was converted into a high-affinity system in the presence of biomn. biomny-mediated biotin uptake was severely impaired by replacement of the walker a lysine residue in biom, demonstrating dependency of high-affinity transport on a functional atpase. biochemical assays revealed that biom, bion, and bioy proteins form stable complexes in membranes of the heterologous host. expression of truncated bio transport operons, each with one gene deleted, resulted in stable biomn complexes but revealed only low amounts of biomy and biony aggregates in the absence of the respective third partner. the results substantiate our earlier suggestion of a mechanistically novel group of membrane transporters.

TI  == the appa and ppsr proteins from rhodobacter sphaeroides can establish a redox-dependent signal chain but fail to transmit blue-light signals in other bacteria.
AB  == the appa protein of rhodobacter sphaeroides has the unique ability to sense and transmit redox and light signals. in response to decreasing oxygen tension, appa  antagonizes the transcriptional regulator ppsr, which represses the expression of photosynthesis genes, including the puc operon. this mechanism, which is based on direct protein-protein interaction, is prevented by blue-light absorption of the  bluf domain located in the n-terminal part of appa. in order to test whether appa and ppsr are sufficient to transmit redox and light signals, we expressed these proteins in three different bacterial species and monitored oxygen- and blue-light-dependent puc expression either directly or by using a luciferase-based reporter construct. the appa/ppsr system could mediate redox-dependent gene expression in the alphaproteobacteria rhodobacter capsulatus and paracoccus denitrificans but not in the gammaproteobacterium escherichia coli. analysis of a prra mutant strain of r. sphaeroides strongly suggests that light-dependent gene expression requires a balanced interplay of the appa/ppsr system with the prra response regulator. therefore, the appa/ppsr system was unable to establish light signaling in other bacteria. based on our data, we present a model for the interdependence of appa/ppsr signaling and the prra transcriptional activator.

TI  == conservation and variation between rhodobacter capsulatus and escherichia coli tat systems.
AB  == the tat system allows the translocation of folded and often cofactor-containing proteins across biological membranes. here, we show by an interspecies transfer of a complete tat translocon that tat systems are largely, but not fully, interchangeable even between different classes of proteobacteria. the tat apparatus from the alpha-proteobacterium rhodobacter capsulatus was transferred to a tat-deficient escherichia coli strain, which is a gamma-proteobacterium. similar to that of e. coli, the r. capsulatus tat system consists of three components, rc-tata, rc-tatb, and rc-tatc. a fourth gene (rc-tatf) is present in  the rc-tatabcf operon which has no apparent relevance for translocation. the translational starts of rc-tatc and rc-tatf overlap in four nucleotides (atga) with the preceding tat genes, pointing to efficient translational coupling of rc-tatb, rc-tatc, and rc-tatf. we show by a variety of physiological and biochemical assays that the r. capsulatus tat system functionally targets the e.  coli tat substrates tora, amia, amic, and formate dehydrogenase. even a tat substrate from a third organism is accepted, demonstrating that usually tat systems and tat substrates from different proteobacteria are compatible with each other. only one exceptional tat substrate of e. coli, a membrane-anchored dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) reductase, was not targeted by the r. capsulatus tat system, resulting in a dmso respiration deficiency. although the general features of tat substrates and translocons are similar between species, the data indicate  that details in the targeting pathways can vary considerably.

TI  == immunobiological activities of a new nontoxic lipopolysaccharide from acidiphilium gs18h/atcc55963, a soil isolate from an indian copper mine.
AB  == a novel nontoxic lipopolysaccharide (lps) was purified from acidiphilium strain gs18h/atcc55963. the chemical composition of the lipid a part of this lps is distinctly different from that of known lipid a molecules. the lps was investigated to determine its capacity to provide protection against toxic lps or endotoxic shock, as has been reported for other nontoxic lpss (rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodobacter capsulatus), and also the extent and type of immunomodulatory response in terms of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), interleukin-1beta (il-beta), and il-6 release as well as no secretion by stimulated monocyte-macrophage systems. this study demonstrates clearly that mice immunized or primed with this lps are fully protected against challenge with toxic escherichia coli lps. unlike most of the extensively studied nontoxic lpss, this lps induced reactive nitrogen intermediates and released tnf-alpha, il-beta  and il-6 in both mouse and human monocyte-macrophage systems. however, the extent of the cytokine and lymphokine releasing response was well below the range of the toxic lps, for example that of e. coli. owing to its capacity to provide immunostimulation of the host without causing any lethality to ensure protection  against endotoxic shock, this lps appears to have potential therapeutic value.

TI  == atpase activity associated with the magnesium chelatase h-subunit of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway is an artefact.
AB  == magnesium chelatase inserts mg2+ into protoporphyrin ix and is the first unique enzyme of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. it is a heterotrimeric enzyme, composed of i- (40 kda), d- (70 kda) and h- (140 kda) subunits. the i- and d-proteins belong to the family of aaa+ (atpases associated with various cellular activities), but only i-subunit hydrolyses atp to adp. the d-subunits provide a platform for the assembly of the i-subunits, which results in a two-tiered hexameric ring complex. however, the d-subunits are unstable in the chloroplast unless atpase active i-subunits are present. the h-subunit binds protoporphyrin and is suggested to be the catalytic subunit. previous studies have indicated that the h-subunit also has atpase activity, which is in accordance with an earlier suggested two-stage mechanism of the reaction. in the present study, we demonstrate that gel filtration chromatography of affinity-purified rhodobacter capsulatus h-subunit produced in escherichia coli generates a high- and a low-molecular-mass fraction. both fractions were dominated by the h-subunit, but  the atpase activity was only found in the high-molecular-mass fraction and magnesium chelatase activity was only associated with the low-molecular-mass fraction. we demonstrated that light converted monomeric low-molecular-mass h-subunit into high-molecular-mass aggregates. we conclude that atp utilization by magnesium chelatase is solely connected to the i-subunit and suggest that a contaminating e. coli protein, which binds to aggregates of the h-subunit, caused the previously reported atpase activity of the h-subunit.

TI  == modulation of proton pumping efficiency in bacterial atp synthases.
AB  == the atp synthase in chromatophores of rhodobacter caspulatus can effectively generate a transmembrane ph difference coupled to the hydrolysis of atp. the rate of hydrolysis was rather insensitive to the depletion of adp in the assay medium  by an atp regenerating system (phospho-enol-pyruvate (pep) and pyruvate kinase (pk)). the steady state values of deltaph were however drastically reduced as a consequence of adp depletion. the clamped concentrations of adp obtained using different pk activities in the assay medium could be calculated and an apparent kd approximately 0.5 microm was estimated. the extent of proton uptake was also strongly dependent on the addition of phosphate to the assay medium. the kd for this effect was about 70 microm. analogous experiments were performed in membrane fragment from escherichia coli. in this case, however, the hydrolysis rate was strongly inhibited by pi, added up to 3 mm. inhibition by pi was nearly completely suppressed following depletion of adp. the kd's for the adp and pi were in the micromolar range and submillimolar range, respectively, and were mutually dependent from the concentration of the other ligand. contrary to hydrolysis, the pumping of protons was rather insensitive to changes in the concentrations of the two ligands. at intermediate concentrations, proton pumping was actually stimulated, while the hydrolysis was inhibited. it is concluded that, in these two bacterial organisms, adp and phosphate induce a functional state of the atp synthase competent for a tightly coupled proton pumping, while the depletion of either one of these two ligands favors an inefficient (slipping) functional state. the switch between these states can probably be related to a structural change in the c-terminal alpha-helical hairpin of the epsilon-subunit, from an extended conformation, in which atp hydrolysis is tightly coupled to proton pumping, to a retracted one, in which atp hydrolysis and proton pumping are loosely coupled.

TI  == rhodobacter capsulatus xdhc is involved in molybdenum cofactor binding and insertion into xanthine dehydrogenase.
AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase (xdh) is a cytoplasmic enzyme with  an (alphabeta)2 heterodimeric structure that is highly identical to homodimeric eukaryotic xanthine oxidoreductases. the crystal structure revealed that the molybdenum cofactor (moco) is deeply buried within the protein. a protein involved in moco insertion and xdh maturation has been identified, which was designated xdhc. xdhc was shown to be essential for the production of active xdh  but is not a subunit of the purified enzyme. here we describe the purification of xdhc and the detailed characterization of its role for xdh maturation. we could show that xdhc binds moco in stoichiometric amounts, which subsequently can be inserted into moco-free apo-xdh. a specific interaction between xdhc and xdhb was identified. we show that xdhc is required for the stabilization of the sulfurated form of moco present in enzymes of the xanthine oxidase family. our findings imply that enzyme-specific proteins exist for the biogenesis of molybdoenzymes, coordinating moco binding and insertion into their respective target proteins. so far, the requirement of such proteins for molybdoenzyme maturation has been described only for prokaryotes.

TI  == heterologous overexpression and purification of cytochrome c' from rhodobacter capsulatus and a mutant (k42e) in the dimerization region. mutation does not alter oligomerization but impacts the heme iron spin state and nitric oxide binding properties.
AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c' (rccp) has been overexpressed in escherichia coli, and its spectroscopic and ligand-binding properties have been investigated. it is concluded that the heterologously expressed protein is assembled correctly, as judged by uv-vis absorption, epr, and resonance raman (rr) spectroscopy of the unligated protein as well as forms in which the heme is ligated by co or no. to probe the oligomerization state of rccp and its potential influence on heme reactivity, we have compared the properties of wild-type rccp with a mutant (k42e) that lacks a salt bridge at the subunit interface. analytical ultracentrifugation indicates that wild-type and k42e proteins are both monomeric in solution, contrary to the homodimeric structure of the crystalline state. surprisingly, the k42e mutation produces a number of changes at the heme center (nearly 20 a distant), including perturbation of the ferric spin-state equilibrium and a change in the ferrous heme-nitrosyl complex from a six-coordinate/five-coordinate mixture to a predominantly five-coordinate heme-no species. rr spectra indicate that ferrous k42e and wild-type rccp both have relatively high fe-his stretching frequencies, suggesting that the more favored five-coordinate heme-nitrosyl formation in k42e is not caused by a weaker fe2+-his bond. nevertheless, the altered reactivity of ferrous k42e with no, together with its modified ferric spin state, shows that structural changes originating at the dimer interface can affect the properties of the heme center,  raising the exciting possibility that intermolecular encounters at the protein surface might modulate the reactivity of cytochrome c' in vivo.

TI  == novel ligands for the extracellular solute receptors of two bacterial trap transporters.
AB  == tripartite atp-independent periplasmic (trap) transporters are relatively common  prokaryotic secondary transporters which comprise an extracytoplasmic solute receptor (esr) protein and two dissimilar membrane proteins or domains, yet the substrates and physiological functions of only a few of these systems are so far  known. in this study, a biophysical approach was used to identify the ligands for the purified rhodobacter capsulatus rrc01191 and escherichia coli yiao proteins,  which are members of two phylogenetically distinct families of trap-esrs found in diverse bacteria. in contrast to previous indirect evidence pointing to rrc01191  orthologues being involved in polyol uptake, it was shown that rrc01191 binds pyruvate, 2-oxobutyrate and a broad range of aliphatic monocarboxylic 2-oxoacid anions with varying affinities (k(d) values 0.08-3 mum), consistent with a predicted role in monocarboxylate transport related to branched-chain amino-acid  biosynthesis. the e. coli yiamno trap transporter has previously been proposed to be an l-xylulose uptake system [plantinga et al. (2004) mol membr biol 21, 51-57], but purified yiao did not bind l- or d-xylulose as judged by fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism or mass spectrometry. instead, these techniques  showed that a breakdown product of l-ascorbate, 2,3-diketo-l-gulonate (2,3-dkg),  binds by a simple one-step mechanism with sub-micromolar affinity. the data provide the first evidence for the existence of esr-dependent transporters for 2-oxoacids and 2,3-dkg, homologues of which appear to be widespread amongst prokaryotes. the results also underline the utility of direct esr ligand-binding  studies for trap transporter characterization.

TI  == regulation and characterization of two nitroreductase genes, npra and nprb, of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == among photosynthetic bacteria, strains b10 and e1f1 of rhodobacter capsulatus photoreduce 2,4-dinitrophenol (dnp), which is stoichiometrically converted into 2-amino-4-nitrophenol by a nitroreductase activity. the reduction of dnp is inhibited in vivo by ammonium, which probably acts at the level of the dnp transport system and/or physiological electron transport to the nitroreductase, since this enzyme is not inhibited by ammonium in vitro. using the complete genome sequence data for strain sb1003 of r. capsulatus, two putative genes coding for possible nitroreductases were isolated from r. capsulatus b10 and disrupted. the phenotypes of these mutant strains revealed that both genes are involved in the reduction of dnp and code for two major nitroreductases, npra and nprb. both enzymes use nad(p)h as the main physiological electron donor. the nitroreductase npra is under ammonium control, whereas the nitroreductase nprb is not. in addition, the expression of the nprb gene seems to be constitutive, whereas npra gene expression is inducible by a wide range of nitroaromatic and heterocyclic compounds, including several dinitroaromatics, nitrofuran derivatives, cb1954, 2-aminofluorene, benzo[a]pyrene, salicylic acid, and paraquat. the identification of two putative mar/sox boxes in the possible promoter region of the npra gene and the induction of npra gene expression by salicylic acid and 2,4-dinitrophenol suggest a role in the control of the npra gene for the two-component marra regulatory system, which in escherichia coli controls the response to some antibiotics and environmental contaminants. in addition, upregulation of the npra gene by paraquat indicates that this gene is probably a member of the soxrs regulon, which is involved in the response to stress conditions in other bacteria.

AB  == for the oxidation and removal of hydrogen sulfide, which causes an offensive odor from the contents of animal intestines, recombinant strains of escherichia coli were constructed. the sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase gene (sqr) from rhodobacter  capsulatus was integrated in low copy numbers into the chromosome of escherichia  coli w3110. multiple copies of sqr on plasmids were also delivered into the cytoplasm of the same strain. the sqr genes were homologously transducted onto the chromosomal lacz region and their existence there was verified by southern blot analysis. sulfide oxidation in a chemical medium effectively increased for the recombinant strains which carried 2 approximately 3 copies of sqr under the control of the lac or tac promoter in the chromosome, and also for strains which  carried 10 copies of sqr under the control of the lac or tac promoter on plasmids. in both types of recombinant, the tac promoter was more effective for sqr expression than the lac promoter. construction of a recombinant with 3 copies of sqr under the control of the tac promoter in the chromosome was unsuccessful.  in recombinants with sqr activity lower than 700 nmol/mg cell protein/min, oxygen consumption increased proportionally to sqr activity. an elevation in sqr activity in this range resulted in an increase in oxygen consumption and a decrease in sulfide concentration. when the recombinant cells were cultured until the 160th generation, wl2, wl3 and wt2, which carried 2, 3 and 2 copies of sqr in the chromosome, respectively, retained sqr activity similar to that of the first  generation. for wl300 and wt20 which carried multi-copies of sqr in plasmids sqr  activity was undetectable. the recombinant with 2 copies of sqr in the chromosome regulated by the tac promoter was most suitable for sulfide oxidation and growth  of the cells.

TI  == microbial dimethylsulfoxide and trimethylamine-n-oxide respiration.
AB  == over the last two decades, the biochemistry and genetics of dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) and trimethylamine-n-oxide (tmao) respiration has been characterised, particularly in escherichia coli marine bacteria of the genus shewanella and the  purple phototrophic bacteria, rhodobacter sphaeroides and r. capsulatus. all of the enzymes (or catalytic subunits) involved the final step in dmso and tmao respiration contain a pterin molybdenum cofactor and are members of the dmso reductase family of molybdoenzymes. in e. coli, the dimethylsulfoxide reductase (dmsabc) can be purified from membranes as a complex, which exhibits quinol-dmso  oxidoreductase activity. the enzyme is anchored to the membrane via the dmsc subunit and its catalytic subunit dmsa is now considered to face the periplasm. electron transfer to dmsa involves the dmsb subunit, which is a polyferredoxin related to subunits found in other molybdoenzymes such as nitrate reductase and formate dehydrogenase. a characteristic of the dmsab-type dmso reductase is its ability to reduce a variety of s- and n-oxides. e. coli contains a trimethylamine-n-oxide reductase (tora) that is highly specific for n-oxides. this enzyme is located in the periplasm and is connected to the quinone pool via  a membrane-bound penta-haem cytochrome (torc). dorca in purple phototrophic bacteria of the genus rhodobacter is very similar to torca with the critical difference that dora catalyses reduction of both dmso and tmao. it is known as a  dmso reductase because the s-oxide is the best substrate. crystal structures of dora and tora have revealed critical differences at the mo active site that may explain the differences between substrate specificity between the two enzymes. dmsa, tora and dora possess a "twin arginine" n-terminal signal sequence consistent with their secretion via the tat secretory system and not the sec system. the enzymes are secreted with their bound prosthetic groups: this take place in the cytoplasm and the biogenesis involves a chaperone protein, which is  cognate for each enzyme. expression of the dmso and tmao respiratory operons is induced in response to a fall in oxygen tension. dmsabc expression is positively  controlled by the oxygen-responsive transcription factor, fnr and mode, a transcription factor that binds molybdate. in contrast, torcad expression is not  under fnr- or mode-control but is dependent upon a sensor histidine kinase-response regulator pair, torsr, which activate gene expression under conditions of low oxygen tension in the presence of n- or s-oxide. regulation of  dorcda expression is similar to that seen for torcad but it appears that the expression of the sensor histidine kinase-response regulator pair, dorsr is regulated by fnr and there is an additional tier of regulation involving the mode-homologue mopb, molybdate and the transcription factor dorx. analysis of microbial genomes has revealed the presence of dms and tor operons in a wide variety of bacteria and in some archaea and duplicate dms and tor operons have been identified in e. coli. challenges ahead will include the determination of the significance of the presence of the dms operon in bacterial pathogens and the determination of the significance of dmso respiration in the global turnover of marine organo-sulfur compounds.

AB  == endoribonuclease e, a key enzyme involved in rna decay and processing in bacteria, organizes a protein complex called degradosome. in escherichia coli, rhodobacter capsulatus, and streptomyces coelicolor, rnase e interacts with the phosphate-dependent exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, dead-box helicase(s), and additional factors in an rna-degrading complex. to characterize  the degradosome of the psychrotrophic bacterium pseudomonas syringae lz4w, rnase  e was enriched by cation exchange chromatography and fractionation in a glycerol  density gradient. most surprisingly, the hydrolytic exoribonuclease rnase r was found to co-purify with rnase e. co-immunoprecipitation and ni(2+)-affinity pull-down experiments confirmed the specific interaction between rnase r and rnase e. additionally, the dead-box helicase rhle was identified as part of this  protein complex. fractions comprising the three proteins showed rnase e and rnase r activity and efficiently degraded a synthetic stem-loop containing rna in the presence of atp. the unexpected association of rnase r with rnase e and rhle in an rna-degrading complex indicates that the cold-adapted p. syringae has a degradosome of novel structure. the identification of rnase r instead of polynucleotide phosphorylase in this complex underlines the importance of the interaction between endo- and exoribonucleases for the bacterial rna metabolism.  the physical association of rnase e with an exoribonuclease and an rna helicase apparently is a common theme in the composition of bacterial rna-degrading complexes.

AB  == hydrogen metabolism is closely related to other important metabolic and energetic processes of bacterial cells, such as photosynthesis, anaerobic respiration and sulphur metabolism. even small environmental changes influence these networks through different regulatory systems. the presence or absence of oxygen is one of the most important signals; how the cascades evolved to transmit this signal in different bacteria is summarized. in many instances, hydrogen is released only under anoxic conditions, because of bioenergetic considerations. most [nife] hydrogenases are inactivated by oxygen, but many of them can be re-activated under reducing conditions. in addition to direct inactivation of the hydrogenases, oxygen can also regulate their expression. the global regulatory systems [fnr (fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator), arcab (aerobic respiratory control) and regab], which respond to alterations in oxygen content and redox conditions of the environment, have an important role in hydrogenase regulation of several bacteria. fnr-like proteins were shown to be important for  the regulation of hydrogenases in escherichia coli, thiocapsa roseopersicina and  rhizobium leguminosarum, whereas rega protein modulates the expression of hupsl genes in rhodobacter capsulatus.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel vitamin b12 (cobalamin) biosynthetic enzyme (cobz) from rhodobacter capsulatus, containing flavin, heme,  and fe-s cofactors.
AB  == one of the most intriguing steps during cobalamin (vitamin b12) biosynthesis is the ring contraction process that leads to the extrusion of one of the integral macrocyclic carbon atoms from the tetrapyrrole-derived framework. the aerobic cobalamin pathway requires the action of a monooxygenase called cobg (precorrin-3b synthase), which generates a hydroxylactone intermediate that is subsequently ring-contracted by cobj. however, in the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus, which harbors an aerobic-like pathway, there is no cobg in the main cobalamin biosynthetic operon although it does contain an additional  uncharacterized gene called orf663. to demonstrate the involvement of orf663 in cobalamin synthesis, the first dedicated 10 genes of the b12 pathway (including orf663), encoding enzymes for the transformation of uroporphyrinogen iii into hydrogenobyrinic acid (hba), were sequentially cloned into a plasmid to generate  an artificial operon, which, when transformed into escherichia coli, endowed the  host with the ability to make hba. deletion of orf663 from this operon prevented  hba synthesis, demonstrating that it was essential for corrin construction. hba synthesis was restored to this recombinant strain either by returning orf663 or by substituting it with cobg. recombinant overproduction of orf663, now renamed cobz, allowed the characterization of a novel cofactor-rich protein, housing two  fe-s centers, a flavin, and a heme group, which like b12 itself is a modified tetrapyrrole. a mechanism for orf663 (cobz) in cobalamin biosynthesis is proposed.

TI  == the glutathione-glutaredoxin system in rhodobacter capsulatus: part of a complex  regulatory network controlling defense against oxidative stress.
AB  == mutants with defects in components of the glutathione-glutaredoxin (gsh/grx) system of rhodobacter capsulatus were constructed to study its role in defense against oxidative stress and the redox-dependent formation of photosynthetic complexes. the lack of the glutaredoxin 3 gene (grxc) or the glutathione synthetase b gene (gshb) resulted in lower growth rates under aerobic conditions  and higher sensitivity to oxidative stress, confirming the role of the gsh/grx system in oxidative stress defense. both mutants are highly sensitive to disulfide stress, indicating a major contribution of the gsh/grx system to the thiol-disulfide redox buffer in the cytoplasm. like mutations in the thioredoxin  system, mutations in the gsh/grx system affected the formation of photosynthetic  complexes, which is redox dependent in r. capsulatus. expression of the genes grxc, gshb, grxa for glutaredoxin 1, and gora for glutathione reductase, all encoding components of the gsh/grx system, was not induced by oxidative stress. other genes, for which a role in oxidative stress was established in escherichia  coli, acna, fpr, fur, and katg, were strongly induced by oxidative stress in r. capsulatus. mutations in the grxc, and/or gshb, and/or trxc (thioredoxin 2) genes affected expression of these genes, indicating an interplay of the different defense systems against oxidative stress. the oxyr and the soxrs regulons control the expression of many genes involved in oxidative stress defense in e. coli in response to h2o2 and superoxide, respectively. our data and the available genome  sequence of r. capsulatus suggest that a soxrs system is lacking but an alternative superoxide specific regulator exists in r. capsulatus. while the expression of gora and grxa is regulated by h2o2 in e. coli this is not the case  in r. capsulatus, indicating that the oxyr regulons of these two species are significantly different.

TI  == hydroxylamine assimilation by rhodobacter capsulatus e1f1. requirement of the hcp gene (hybrid cluster protein) located in the nitrate assimilation nas gene region for hydroxylamine reduction.
AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus e1f1 grows phototrophically with nitrate as nitrogen source. using primers designed for conserved motifs in bacterial assimilatory nitrate reductases, a 450-bp dna was amplified by pcr and used for the screening  of a genomic library. a cosmid carrying an insert with four sali fragments of 2.8, 4.1, 4.5, and 5.8 kb was isolated, and dna sequencing revealed that it contains a nitrate assimilation (nas) gene region, including the hcp gene coding  for a hybrid cluster protein (hcp). expression of hcp is probably regulated by a  nitrite-sensitive repressor encoded by the adjacent nsrr gene. a his(6)-hcp was overproduced in escherichia coli and purified. hcp contained about 6 iron and 4 labile sulfide atoms per molecule, in agreement with the presence of both [2fe-2s] and [4fe-2s-2o] clusters, and showed hydroxylamine reductase activity, forming ammonia in vitro with methyl viologen as reductant. the apparent k(m) values for nh(2)oh and methyl viologen were 1 mm and 7 microm, respectively, at the ph and temperature optima (9.3 and 40 degrees c). the activity was oxygen-sensitive and was inhibited by sulfide and iron reagents. r. capsulatus e1f1 grew phototrophically, but not heterotrophically, with 1 mm nh(2)oh as nitrogen source, and up to 10 mm nh(2)oh was taken up by anaerobic resting cells. ammonium was transiently accumulated in the media, and its assimilation was prevented by l-methionine-d,l-sulfoximine, a glutamine synthetase inhibitor. in addition, hydroxylamine- or nitrite-grown cells showed the higher hydroxylamine reductase activities. however, r. capsulatus b10s, a strain lacking the whole hcp-nas region, did not grow with 1 mm nh(2)oh. also, e. coli cells overproducing hcp tolerate hydroxyl-amine better during anaerobic growth. these results suggest that hcp is involved in assimilation of nh(2)oh, a toxic product that could be formed during nitrate assimilation, probably in the nitrite reduction step.

TI  == the role of active site glutamate residues in catalysis of rhodobacter capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase.
AB  == xanthine dehydrogenase (xdh) from the bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus catalyzes  the hydroxylation of xanthine to uric acid with nad+ as the electron acceptor. r. capsulatus xdh forms an (alphabeta)2 heterotetramer and is highly homologous to homodimeric eukaryotic xanthine oxidoreductases. here we first describe reductive titration and steady state kinetics on recombinant wild-type r. capsulatus xdh purified from escherichia coli, and we then proceed to evaluate the catalytic importance of the active site residues glu-232 and glu-730. the steady state and  rapid reaction kinetics of an e232a variant exhibited a significant decrease in both kcat and kred as well as increased km and kd values as compared with the wild-type protein. no activity was determined for the e730a, e730q, e730r, and e730d variants in either the steady state or rapid reaction experiments, indicating at least a 10(7) decrease in catalytic effectiveness for this variant. this result is fully consistent with the proposed role of this residue as an active site base that initiates catalysis.

TI  == protein splicing and auto-cleavage of bacterial intein-like domains lacking a c'-flanking nucleophilic residue.
AB  == bacterial intein-like (bil) domains are newly identified homologs of intein protein-splicing domains. the two known types of bil domains together with inteins and hedgehog (hog) auto-processing domains form the hog/intein (hint) superfamily. bil domains are distinct from inteins and hogs in sequence, phylogenetic distribution, and host protein type, but little is known about their biochemical activity. here we experimentally study the auto-processing activity of four bil domains. an a-type bil domain from clostridium thermocellum showed both protein-splicing and auto-cleavage activities. the splicing is notable, because this domain has a native ala c'-flanking residue rather than a nucleophilic residue, which is absolutely necessary for intein protein splicing.  b-type bil domains from rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhodobacter capsulatus cleaved their n' or c' ends. we propose an alternative protein-splicing mechanism for the a-type bil domains. after an initial n-s acyl shift, creating a thioester bond at the n' end of the domain, the c' end of the domain is cleaved by asn cyclization. the resulting amino end of the c'-flank attacks the thioester bond next at the n' end of the domain. this aminolysis step splices the two flanks of  the domain. the b-type bil domain cleavage activity is explained in the context of the canonical intein protein-splicing mechanism. our results suggest that the  different hint domains have related biochemical activities of proteolytic cleavages, ligation and splicing. yet the predominant reactions diverged in each  hint type according to their specific biological roles. we suggest that the bil domain cleavage and splicing reactions are mechanisms for post-translationally generating protein variability, particularly in extracellular bacterial proteins.

TI  == temperature-dependent processing of the cspa mrna in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the expression of genes for cold-shock proteins is proposed to be regulated primarily at the post-transcriptional level by increase of mrna stability after transition to low temperatures. destabilization of the escherichia coli cold-induced cspa transcript at 37 degrees c as well as stabilization upon cold shock is known to depend on the unusually long (159 nt) 5'-untranslated region. determination of the cspa mrna 5'-end from rhodobacter capsulatus revealed a shorter distance between the start of transcription and the start codon for translation. the cspa mrna of r. capsulatus was shown to be stabilized at low temperatures to a greater extent than other investigated transcripts. to address  the mechanism of decay of the cspa transcript, it was incubated with purified degradosome of r. capsulatus. endoribonucleolytic in vitro cleavage in the 5'-untranslated region as reported for the cspa transcript of e. coli in vivo was not observed. instead, the data indicated that the cspa mrna decay in r. capsulatus is mediated by endoribonucleolytic cleavages within the cspa coding region.

TI  == rhodobacter capsulatus photoactive yellow protein: genetic context, spectral and  kinetics characterization, and mutagenesis.
AB  == a gene for photoactive yellow protein (pyp) was previously cloned from rhodobacter capsulatus (rc), and we have now found it to be associated with genes for gas vesicle formation in the recently completed genome sequence. however, the pyp had not been characterized as a protein. we have now produced the recombinant rcpyp in escherichia coli as a glutathione-s-transferase (gst) fusion protein, along with the biosynthetic enzymes, resulting in the formation of holo-rcpyp following cleavage of the gst tag. the absorption spectrum (with characteristic peaks at 435 and 375 nm) and the photocycle kinetics, initiated by a laser flash  at 445 nm, are generally similar to those of rhodobacter sphaeroides (rspyp) but  are significantly different from those of the prototypic pyp from halorhodospira  halophila (hhpyp), which has a single peak at 446 nm and has slower recovery. rcpyp also is photoactive when excited with near-ultraviolet laser light, but the end point is then above the preflash baseline. this suggests that some of the pyp chromophore is present in the cis-protonated conformation in the resting state. the excess 435 nm form in rcpyp, built up from repetitive 365 nm laser flashes, returns to the preflash baseline with an estimated half-life of 2 h, which is markedly slower than that for the same reaction in rspyp. met100 has been reported to facilitate cis-trans isomerization in hhpyp, yet both rc and rspyps have lys and gly substitutions at positions 99 and 100 (using hhpyp numbering throughout) and have 100-fold faster recovery kinetics than does hhpyp. however,  the g100m and k99q mutations of rcpyp have virtually no effect on kinetics. apparently, the rcpyp m100 is in a different conformation, as was recently found  for the pyp domain of rhodocista centenaria ppr. the cumulative results show that the two rhodobacter pyps are clearly distinct from the other species of pyp that  have been characterized. these properties also suggest a different functional role, that we postulate to be in regulation of gas vesicle genes, which are known to be light-regulated in other species.

TI  == rhodobacter capsulatus nifa1 promoter: high-gc -10 regions in high-gc bacteria and the basis for their transcription.
AB  == it was previously shown that the rhodobacter capsulatus ntrc enhancer-binding protein activates the r. capsulatus housekeeping rna polymerase but not the escherichia coli rna polymerase at the nifa1 promoter. we have tested the hypothesis that this activity is due to the high g+c content of the -10 sequence. a comparative analysis of r. capsulatus and other alpha-proteobacterial promoters with known transcription start sites suggests that the g+c content of the -10 region is higher than that for e. coli. both in vivo and in vitro results obtained with nifa1 promoters with -10 and/or -35 variations are reported here. a major conclusion of this study is that alpha-proteobacteria have evolved a promiscuous sigma factor and core rna polymerase that can transcribe promoters with high-gc -10 regions in addition to the classic e. coli pribnow box. to facilitate studies of r. capsulatus transcription, we cloned and overexpressed all of the rna polymerase subunits in e. coli, and these were reconstituted in vitro to form an active, recombinant r. capsulatus rna polymerase with properties mimicking those of the natural polymerase. thus, no additional factors from r. capsulatus are necessary for the recognition of high-gc promoters or for activation by r. capsulatus ntrc. the addition of r. capsulatus sigma(70) to the  e. coli core rna polymerase or the use of -10 promoter mutants did not facilitate r. capsulatus ntrc activation of the nifa1 promoter by the e. coli rna polymerase. thus, an additional barrier to activation by r. capsulatus ntrc exists, probably a lack of the proper r. capsulatus ntrc-e. coli rna polymerase (protein-protein) interaction(s).

TI  == protein-template-driven formation of polynuclear iron species.
AB  == ferritins are iron-storage proteins capable of holding up to 4500 fe(3+) ions within a single water-soluble protein shell made from 24 polypeptide chains. the  glu128arg/glu135arg mutants of escherichia coli and rhodobacter capsulatus bacterioferritins are unable to associate into 24-meric structures, with dimers of polypeptide chains being their stable forms. the aerobic addition to these of  up to 8-10 or 14-20 fe(2+) ions per dimer, respectively, results in the oxidation of the added fe(2+) to fe(3+). gel permeation chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium studies confirm that the fe(3+) ions are associated with the polypeptide dimer, and the lack of intense epr signals from magnetically isolated fe(3+) ions confirms the formation of one or more antiferromagnetically coupled clusters of fe(3+) ions. the effect of fe(3+) chelators on iron-loaded subunit dimers is to remove the fe(3+) from the protein, but to do so slowly, consistent  with it not being merely adventitiously associated with protein. these data provide experimental support for the presence of nucleation centers for the mineral cores in bacterioferritins and indicate that these proteins are not simply acting as vessels in which hydrolysis of fe(3+) occurs independent from the protein surface. from analyses of x-ray structures and amino acid sequence comparisons, possible nucleation sites are identified.

TI  == rna polymerase subunit requirements for activation by the enhancer-binding protein rhodobacter capsulatus ntrc.
AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus ntrc is an enhancer-binding protein that activates transcription of the r. capsulatus sigma 70 rna polymerase, but does not activate the escherichia coli sigma 70-rna polymerase at the nifa1 promoter. we utilized r. capsulatus:e. coli hybrid rna polymerases assembled in vitro to investigate the subunits required for protein-protein interaction with rcntrc at the nifa1mut1 promoter. assembly of core rc alpha beta beta' or hybrid rna polymerases containing the rc beta beta' subunits absolutely require the inclusion of an omega subunit, with the ec omega subunit only partially promoting rna polymerase assembly. the rc alpha ec beta beta' rna polymerase is not activated by rcntrc. moreover, a mutant form of the rc alpha lacking the alpha c-terminal domain, when assembled with the rc beta beta'omega and sigma 70 subunits, is activated by rcntrc. these results suggest that the r. capsulatus alpha subunit is not important for rcntrc interaction. all hybrid rna polymerases that contained the rc beta' were activated by rcntrc, suggesting that the rc beta' subunit plays an important role. it is proposed that rcntrc recruits r. capsulatus sigma 70-rna polymerase to the promoter through interaction with rc beta'. rcntrc interacts with rna polymerase from a unique position, with dimers centered at -118 bp from the start site. placing the rcntrc tandem binding sites  on the opposite face of the helix (-113 bp) completely abolished transcription activation. moving the rcntrc tandem binding sites 20 bp closer to or further from the promoter significantly reduced activation, again suggesting unique spatial constraints on how rcntrc interacts with the r. capsulatus rna polymerase.

TI  == the dithiol:disulfide oxidoreductases dsba and dsbb of rhodobacter capsulatus are not directly involved in cytochrome c biogenesis, but their inactivation restores the cytochrome c biogenesis defect of ccda-null mutants.
AB  == the cytoplasmic membrane protein ccda and its homologues in other species, such as dsbd of escherichia coli, are thought to supply the reducing equivalents required for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes that occurs in the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria. ccda-null mutants of the facultative phototroph rhodobacter capsulatus are unable to grow under photosynthetic conditions (ps(-)) and do not produce any active cytochrome c oxidase (nadi(-)) due to a pleiotropic cytochrome c deficiency. however, under photosynthetic or respiratory growth conditions, these mutants revert frequently to yield ps(+) nadi(+) colonies that  produce c-type cytochromes despite the absence of ccda. complementation of a ccda-null mutant for the ps(+) growth phenotype was attempted by using a genomic  library constructed with chromosomal dna from a revertant. no complementation was observed, but plasmids that rescued a ccda-null mutant for photosynthetic growth  by homologous recombination were recovered. analysis of one such plasmid revealed that the rescue ability was mediated by open reading frame 3149, encoding the dithiol:disulfide oxidoreductase dsba. dna sequence data revealed that the dsba allele on the rescuing plasmid contained a frameshift mutation expected to produce a truncated, nonfunctional dsba. indeed, a dsba ccda double mutant was shown to be ps(+) nadi(+), establishing that in r. capsulatus the inactivation of dsba suppresses the c-type cytochrome deficiency due to the absence of ccda. next, the ability of the wild-type dsba allele to suppress the ps(+) growth phenotype of the dsba ccda double mutant was exploited to isolate dsba-independent ccda revertants. sequence analysis revealed that these revertants carried mutations in dsbb and that their ps(+) phenotypes could be suppressed by the wild-type allele of dsbb. as with dsba, a dsbb ccda double mutant was also ps(+) nadi(+) and produced c-type cytochromes. therefore, the absence of either dsba or dsbb restores c-type cytochrome biogenesis in the absence of ccda. finally, it was also found that the dsba-null and dsbb-null single mutants of r. capsulatus are ps(+) and produce c-type cytochromes, unlike  their e. coli counterparts, but are impaired for growth under respiratory conditions. this finding demonstrates that in r. capsulatus the dithiol:disulfide oxidoreductases dsba and dsbb are not essential for cytochrome c biogenesis even  though they are important for respiration under certain conditions.

TI  == inactivation of mg chelatase during transition from anaerobic to aerobic growth in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the facultative photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus can adapt from an anaerobic photosynthetic mode of growth to aerobic heterotrophic metabolism. as this adaptation occurs, the cells must rapidly halt bacteriochlorophyll synthesis to prevent phototoxic tetrapyrroles from accumulating, while still allowing heme  synthesis to continue. a likely control point is mg chelatase, the enzyme that diverts protoporphyrin ix from heme biosynthesis toward the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathway by inserting mg(2+) to form mg-protoporphyrin ix. mg chelatase is composed of three subunits that are encoded by the bchi, bchd, and bchh genes in r. capsulatus. we report that bchh is the rate-limiting component of mg chelatase activity in cell extracts. bchh binds protoporphyrin ix, and bchh that has been expressed and purified from escherichia coli is red in color due to the bound protoporphyrin ix. recombinant bchh is rapidly inactivated by light in  the presence of o(2), and the inactivation results in the formation of a covalent adduct between the protein and the bound protoporphyrin ix. when photosynthetically growing r. capsulatus cells are transferred to aerobic conditions, mg chelatase is rapidly inactivated, and bchh is the component that is most rapidly inactivated in vivo when cells are exposed to aerobic conditions. the light- and o(2)-stimulated inactivation of bchh could account for the rapid inactivation of mg chelatase in vivo and provide a mechanism for inhibiting the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll during adaptation of photosynthetically grown cells to aerobic conditions while still allowing heme synthesis to occur for aerobic respiration.

AB  == we describe here new members of the h-ns protein family identified in a psychrotrophic acinetobacter spp. bacterium collected in siberia and in a psychrophilic psychrobacter spp. bacterium collected in antarctica. both are phylogenetically closely related to the hvra and spb rhodobacter transcriptional  regulators. their amino acid sequence shares 40% identity, and their predicted secondary structure displays a structural and functional organization in two modules similar to that of h-ns in escherichia coli. remarkably, the acinetobacter protein fully restores to the wild-type h-ns-dependent phenotypes,  whereas the psychrobacter protein is no longer able to reverse the effects of h-ns deficiency in an e. coli mutant strain above 30 degrees c. moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrate that the ability of the psychrobacter h-ns protein  to bind curved dna and to form dimers is altered at 37 degrees c. the construction of hybrid proteins containing the n- or the c-terminal part of e. coli h-ns fused to the c- or n-terminal part of the psychrobacter protein demonstrates the role of the n-terminal domain in this process. finally, circular dichroism analysis of purified h-ns proteins suggests that, as compared with the  e. coli and acinetobacter proteins, the alpha-helical domain displays weaker intermolecular interactions in the psychrobacter protein, which may account for the low thermal stability observed at 37 degrees c.

TI  == thioredoxin 2 is involved in oxidative stress defence and redox-dependent expression of photosynthesis genes in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == thioredoxins are small ubiquitous proteins that display different functions mainly via redox-mediated processes. the facultatively photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus harbours at least two genes for thioredoxin 1 and 2, trxa  and trxc. it is demonstrated that thioredoxin 2 of r. capsulatus can partially replace the thioredoxin 1 function as a hydrogen donor for methionine sulfoxide reductase but cannot replace thioredoxin 1 as a subunit of phage t7 dna polymerase. by inactivating the trxc gene in r. capsulatus, it is shown that thioredoxin 2 is involved in resistance against oxidative stress. as thioredoxin  1 of rhodobacter sphaeroides, r. capsulatus thioredoxin 2 affects the oxygen-dependent expression of photosynthesis genes, albeit in an opposite way. the trxc mutant of r. capsulatus shows a stronger increase in photosynthesis gene expression after a decrease in oxygen tension than the isogenic wild-type strain. the expression of the trxc gene is downregulated by oxygen.

TI  == protein-protein interactions between cytochrome b and the fe-s protein subunits during qh2 oxidation and large-scale domain movement in the bc1 complex.
AB  == the ubihydroquinone:cytochrome (cyt) c oxidoreductase, or bc(1) complex, and its  homologue the b(6)f complex are key components of respiratory and photosynthetic  electron transport chains as they contribute to the generation of an electrochemical gradient used by the atp synthase to produce atp. the bc(1) complex has two catalytic domains, ubihydroquinone oxidation (q(o)) and ubiquinone reduction (q(i)) sites, that are located on each side of the membrane. the key to the energetic efficiency of this enzyme relies upon the occurrence of  a unique electron bifurcation reaction at its q(o) site. recently, several lines  of evidence have converged to establish that in the bc(1) complex the extrinsic domain of the fe-s subunit that contains a [2fe2s] metal cluster moves during catalysis to shuttle electrons between the q(o) site and c(1) heme. while this step is required for electron bifurcation, available data also suggest that the movement might be controlled to ensure maximal energetic efficiency [darrouzet et al. (2000) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 97, 4567-4572]. to gain insight into the plausible control mechanism, we used a biochemical genetic approach to define the different regions of the bc(1) complex that might interact with each other. previously, we found that a mutation located at position l286 of the ef loop of rhodobacter capsulatus cyt b could alleviate movement impairment resulting from a mutation in the hinge region, linking the [2fe2s] cluster domain to the membrane  anchor of the fe-s subunit. here we report that various substitutions at position 288 on the opposite side of the ef loop also impair q(o) site catalysis. in particular, we note that while most of the substitutions affect only qh(2) oxidation, yet others like t288s also hinder the rate of the movement of the fe-s subunit. thus, position 288 of cyt b appears to be important for both the qh(2) oxidation and the movement of the fe-s subunit. moreover, we found that, upon substitution of t288 by other amino acids, additional compensatory mutations located at the [2fe2s] cluster or the hinge domains of the fe-s subunit, or on the cd loop of cyt b, arise readily to alleviate these defects. these studies indicate that intimate protein-protein interactions occur between cyt b and the fe-s subunits to sustain fast movement and efficient qh(2) oxidation and highlight the critical dual role the ef loop of cyt b to fine-tune the docking and movement of the fe-s subunit during q(o) site catalysis.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of pmg160, a mobilizable cryptic plasmid from rhodobacter blasticus.
AB  == a 3.4-kb cryptic plasmid was obtained from a new isolate of rhodobacter blasticus. this plasmid, designated pmg160, was mobilizable by the conjugative strain escherichia coli s17.1 into rhodobacter sphaeroides, rhodobacter capsulatus, and rhodopseudomonas palustris. it replicated in the latter strains but not in rhodospirillum rubrum, rhodocyclus gelatinosus, or bradyrhizobium species. plasmid pmg160 was stably maintained in r. sphaeroides for more than 100 generations in the absence of selection but showed segregational instability in r. palustris. instability in r. palustris correlated with a decrease in plasmid copy number compared to the copy number in r. sphaeroides. the complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pmg160 contained three open reading frames (orfs). the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by orf1 and orf2 showed high degrees of  homology to the mobs and mobl proteins that are involved in plasmid mobilization  of certain plasmids. based on homology with the rep protein of several other plasmids, orf3 encodes a putative rep gene initiator of plasmid replication. the  functions of these sequences were demonstrated by deletion mapping, frameshift analysis, and analysis of point mutations. two 6.1-kb pmg160-based e. coli-r. sphaeroides shuttle cloning vectors were constructed and designated pmg170 and pmg171. these two novel shuttle vectors were segregationally stable in r. sphaeroides growing under nonselective conditions.

TI  == overexpression of ccl1-2 can bypass the need for the putative apocytochrome chaperone cych during the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes.
AB  == in gram-negative bacteria, including rhodobacter capsulatus, the membrane protein cych acts as a putative apocytochrome chaperone during the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes. cych-null mutants are unable to produce various c-type cytochromes and sustain photosynthetic (ps) growth that requires the cytochromes c1 and c2 or cy. however, ps+ revertants are readily obtained only on minimal, but not on enriched, medium. to obtain further information about the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes, these suppressor mutants were studied. complementation of a cych-null mutant for ps+ growth by a genomic library constructed using dna from a ps+ suppressor yielded a plasmid carrying the ccl1-2 operon, the products of which, ccl1 and ccl2, are also involved in the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes.  dna sequence analysis revealed that the complementing activity resulted from a single point mutation, g488a, located upstream of the coding region of ccl1-2. this mutation changed the -35 region of the ccl1-2 promoter from ttggcc to ttgacc, improving its similarity to the consensus sequence of escherichia colisigma 70-dependent promoters. that the g488a mutation indeed enhanced transcription of ccl1-2 was demonstrated by the use of reporter gene fusions. an  appropriate ccl1-2::lacz transcriptional-translational fusion carrying the g488a  mutation produced in r. capsulatus over 30-fold higher beta-galactosidase activity than a wild-type construct. immunoblot analyses confirmed that ccl1 and  ccl2 were overproduced in the ps+ suppressors. deletion of either ccl1 or ccl2, from the ccl1-2 cluster carrying the g488a mutation abolished the complementing ability, indicating that overexpression of both ccl1 and ccl2 was required to confer the ps+ phenotype on a cych-null mutant. these findings therefore demonstrate that, during r. capsulatus growth on minimal medium, the requirement  for cych in c-type cytochrome biogenesis could be bypassed by overexpressing the  ccl1-2 operon.

TI  == the hfq-like protein nrfa of the phototrophic purple bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus controls nitrogen fixation via regulation of nifa and anfa expression.
AB  == the rhodobacter capsulatus nrfa gene product exhibits extensive similarity to the nif (nitrogen fixation) regulatory factor nrfa of azorhizobium caulinodans and the nucleoid-associated protein hfq of escherichia coli. mutational analysis revealed that, in contrast to the situation in a. caulinodans, nrfa is not essential for diazotrophic growth of r. capsulatus, but it is required for maximal growth rates with n(2) as sole nitrogen source via either molybdenum nitrogenase or the alternative nitrogenase. nrfa was shown to control n(2) fixation in r. capsulatus at the level of expression of the regulatory genes nifa1, nifa2 and anfa, encoding the transcriptional activators of all the other nitrogen fixation genes.

TI  == conservation of the biotin regulon and the bira regulatory signal in eubacteria and archaea.
AB  == biotin is a necessary cofactor of numerous biotin-dependent carboxylases in a variety of microorganisms. the strict control of biotin biosynthesis in escherichia coli is mediated by the bifunctional bira protein, which acts both as a biotin-protein ligase and as a transcriptional repressor of the biotin operon.  little is known about regulation of biotin biosynthesis in other bacteria. using  comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis, we describe the biotin biosynthetic pathway and the bira regulon in most available bacterial genomes. existence of an n-terminal dna-binding domain in bira strictly correlates with the presence of putative bira-binding sites upstream of biotin operons. the predicted bira-binding sites are well conserved among various eubacterial and archaeal genomes. the possible role of the hypothetical genes bioy and yhfs-yhft, newly identified members of the bira regulon, in the biotin metabolism is discussed. based on analysis of co-occurrence of the biotin biosynthetic genes and bioy in complete genomes, we predict involvement of the transmembrane protein bioy in biotin transport. various nonorthologous substitutes of the bioc-coupled  gene bioh from e. coli, observed in several genomes, possibly represent the existence of different pathways for pimeloyl-coa biosynthesis. another interesting result of analysis of operon structures and bira sites is that some biotin-dependent carboxylases from rhodobacter capsulatus, actinomycetes, and archaea are possibly coregulated with bira. bira is the first example of a transcriptional regulator with a conserved binding signal in eubacteria and archaea.

TI  == mechanism of sulfide-quinone reductase investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and sulfur analysis.
AB  == biological sulfide oxidation is a reaction occurring in all three domains of life. one enzyme responsible for this reaction in many bacteria has been identified as sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (sqr). the enzyme from rhodobacter capsulatus is a peripherally membrane-bound flavoprotein with a molecular mass of approximately 48 kda, presumably acting as a homodimer. in this work, sqr from rb. capsulatus has been modified with an n-terminal his tag and heterologously expressed in and purified from escherichia coli. three cysteine residues have been shown to be essential for the reductive half-reaction by site-directed mutagenesis. the catalytic activity has been nearly completely abolished after mutation of each of the cysteines to serine. a decrease in fluorescence on reduction by sulfide as observed for the wild-type enzyme has not been observed for any of the mutated enzymes. mutation of a conserved valine residue to aspartate within the third flavin-binding domain led to a drastically reduced substrate affinity, for both sulfide and quinone. two conserved histidine residues have been mutated individually to alanine. both of the resulting enzymes exhibited a shift in the ph dependence of the sqr reaction. polysulfide has been  identified as a primary reaction product using spectroscopic and chromatographic  methods. on the basis of these data, reaction mechanisms for sulfide-dependent reduction and quinone-dependent oxidation of the enzyme and for the formation of  polysulfide are proposed.

TI  == cobalamin (vitamin b(12)) biosynthesis in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == in rhodobacter capsulatus, cobalamin biosynthesis has been shown to occur when the bacteria are grown either aerobically or anaerobically. however, a comparison of the main cobalamin biosynthetic operon found within r. capsulatus would suggest that the encoded proteins belong to the oxygen-dependent pathway for cobalamin biosynthesis, although, significantly, no homologue of the essential mono-oxygenase cobg has yet been detected. nonetheless, within this main cob operon is found a large open reading frame termed orf663 that is not found in any other cobalamin biosynthetic operon. when overproduced in escherichia coli, orf663 was found to encode a 90 kda integral membrane protein. some of this protein is cleaved within e. coli to give a soluble n-terminal region that can easily be purified and yields a 50 kda flavoprotein. when expressed in harness with the genes for precorrin-3a synthesis, orf663 appears to mediate the transformation of precorrin-3a into a new chromophoric compound. another open reading frame in close proximity to orf663 is termed orf647, and was found to encode a 2fe-2s ferredoxin-like protein. we suggest that these two proteins may provide an alternative oxygen-independent mechanism for ring contraction within r. capsulatus.

TI  == evolutionary domain fusion expanded the substrate specificity of the transmembrane electron transporter dsbd.
AB  == modular organization of proteins has been postulated as a widely used strategy for protein evolution. the multidomain transmembrane protein dsbd catalyzes the transfer of electrons from the cytoplasm to the periplasm of escherichia coli. most bacterial species do not have dsbd, but instead their genomes encode a much  smaller protein, ccda, which resembles the central hydrophobic domain of dsbd. we used reciprocal heterologous complementation assays between e.coli and rhodobacter capsulatus to show that, despite their differences in size and structure, dsbd and ccda are functional homologs. while dsbd transfers reducing potential to periplasmic protein disulfide bond isomerases and to the cytochrome  c thioreduction pathway, ccda appears to be involved only in cytochrome c biogenesis. our findings strongly suggest that, by the acquisition of additional  thiol-redox active domains, dsbd expanded its substrate specificity.

TI  == a point mutation in the atp synthase of rhodobacter capsulatus results in differential contributions of delta(ph) and delta(phi) in driving the atp synthesis reaction.
AB  == the interface between the c-subunit oligomer and the a subunit in the f0 sector of the atp synthase is believed to form the core of the rotating motor powered by the protonic flow. besides the essential casp61 and aarg210 residues (escherichia coli numbering), a few other residues at this interface, although nonessential, show a high degree of conservation, among these aglu219. the homologous residue aglu210 in the atp synthase of the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus has been substituted by a lysine. inner membranes prepared from the mutant strain showed approximately half of the atp synthesis activity when driven both by light and by acid-base transitions. as estimated with the acma assay, proton pumping rates in the inner membranes were also reduced to a similar extent in the mutant. the most striking impairment of atp synthesis in the mutant, a decrease as low as 12 times as compared to the wild-type, was observed in the absence of a transmembrane electrical membrane potential (delta(phi)) at low transmembrane ph difference (delta(ph)). therefore, the mutation seems to affect  both the mechanism responsible for coupling f1 with proton translocation by f0, and the mechanism determining the relative contribution of delta(ph) and delta(phi) in driving atp synthesis.

TI  == oxygen-mediated regulation of porphobilinogen formation in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == a rhodobacter capsulatus hemc mutant has been isolated and used to show that oxygen regulates the intracellular levels of porphobilinogen. experiments using a hemb-cat gene fusion demonstrated that oxygen does not transcriptionally regulate hemb transcription. porphobilinogen synthase activity is not regulated by oxygen  nor is the enzyme feedback inhibited by hemin or protoporphyrin ix. it was demonstrated that less than 20% of [(14)c]aminolevulinate was incorporated into bacteriochlorophyll, suggesting that the majority of the aminolevulinate is diverted from the common tetrapyrrole pathway. porphobilinogen oxygenase activity was not observed in this organism; however, an nadph-linked aminolevulinate dehydrogenase activity was demonstrated. the specific activity of this enzyme increased with increasing oxygen tension. the results presented here suggest that carbon flow over the common tetrapyrrole pathway is regulated by a combination of feedback inhibition of aminolevulinate synthase and diversion of aminolevulinate  from the pathway by aminolevulinate dehydrogenase.

AB  == bacterioferritin from rhodobacter capsulatus was crystallized and its structure was solved at 2.6 a resolution. this first structure of a bacterioferritin from a photosynthetic organism is a spherical particle of 24 subunits displaying 432 point-group symmetry like ferritin and bacterioferritin from escherichia coli. crystallized in the i422 space group, its structural analysis reveals for the first time the non-symmetric heme molecule located on a twofold crystallographic  symmetry axis. other hemes of the protomer are situated on twofold noncrystallographic axes. apparently, both types of sites bind heme in two orientations, leading to an average structure consisting of a symmetric 50:50 mixture, thus satisfying the crystallographic and noncrystallographic symmetry of the crystal. five water molecules are situated close to the heme, which is bound  in a hydrophobic pocket and axially coordinated by two crystallographic or noncrystallographically related methionine residues. its ferroxidase center, in which fe(ii) is oxidized to fe(iii), is empty or fractionally occupied by a metal ion. two positions are observed for the coordinating glu18 side chain instead of  one in the e. coli enzyme in which the site is occupied. this result suggests that the orientation of the glu18 side chain could be constrained by this interaction.

AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus was shown to grow efficiently with taurine as sole source  of sulfur. we identified a gene region exhibiting similarity to the escherichia coli tauabc genes coding for a taurine-specific abc transporter. the r. capsulatus tauabc genes were flanked by two putative operons (orf459-484-590 and  cyse-srpi-nifs2) both reading in opposite direction relative to tauabc. orf459 shows strong similarity to taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase (tpa) from bilophila wadsworthia catalyzing the initial transamination during anaerobic taurine degradation, and orf590 exhibits clear similarity to sulfoacetaldehyde sulfo-lyase from desulfonispora thiosulfatigenes probably catalyzing the step following the taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase (tpa) reaction, whereas nifs2 might code for a putative cysteine desulfurase. expression of r. capsulatus tauabc and nifs2 was inhibited by sulfate, suggesting that tauabc and nifs2 might belong to the same regulon. in contrast, transcription of orf459 was not inhibited by sulfate but was induced by taurine. a tauab deletion mutant showed significantly reduced growth compared to the wild-type with taurine as sole sulfur source in the presence of serine as a nitrogen source, whereas normal growth was observed in the presence of taurine and ammonium. deletion of orf459-484-590 completely abolished growth with taurine/serine. single mutations  in any of the three genes resulted in the same phenotype, indicating that all three genes of this putative operon are essential for taurine sulfur utilization  in the presence of serine. a model for anaerobic taurine sulfur assimilation in r. capsulatus is discussed.

AB  == fluorescence spectroscopic and kinetic analysis of photochemical activity, cofactor and substrate binding, and enzyme denaturation studies were performed with highly purified, recombinant pea nadph:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (por) heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. the results obtained with an  individual stereoisomer of the substrate [c8-ethyl-c13(2)-(r)-protochlorophyllide] demonstrate that the enzyme photoactive state possesses a characteristic fluorescence maximum at 646 nm that is due to the presence of specific charged amino acids in the enzyme catalytic site. the photoactive state is converted directly into an intermediate having fluorescence  at 685 nm in a reaction involving direct hydrogen transfer from the cofactor (nadph). site-directed mutagenesis of the highly conserved tyr275 (y275f) and lys279 (k279i and k279r) residues in the enzyme catalytic pocket demonstrated that the presence of these two amino acids in the wild-type por considerably increases the probability of photoactive state formation following cofactor and substrate binding by the enzyme. at the same time, the presence of these two amino acids destabilizes por and increases the rate of enzyme denaturation. neither tyr275 nor lys279 plays a crucial role in the binding of the substrate or cofactor by the enzyme. in addition, the presence of tyr275 is absolutely necessary for the second step of the protochlorophyllide reduction reaction, "dark" conversion of the 685 nm fluorescence intermediate and the formation of the final product, chlorophyllide. we propose that tyr275 and lys279 participate  in the proper coordination of nadph and pchlide in the enzyme catalytic site and  thereby control the efficiency of the formation of the por photoactive state.

AB  == quintuple mutants of escherichia coli deficient in the c(4)-dicarboxylate carriers of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism (dcta, dcua, dcub, dcuc, and the dcuc homolog dcud, or the citrate/succinate antiporter citt) showed only poor growth on succinate (or other c(4)-dicarboxylates) under oxic conditions. at acidic ph (ph 6) the mutants regained aerobic growth on succinate, but not on fumarate. succinate uptake by the mutants could not be saturated at physiological succinate concentrations (< or =5 mm), in contrast to the wild-type, which had a  k(m) for succinate of 50 microm and a v(max) of 35 u/g dry weight at ph 6. at high substrate concentrations, the mutants showed transport activities (32 u/g dry weight) comparable to that of the wild-type. in the wild-type using dcta as the carrier, succinate uptake had a ph optimum of 6, whereas succinate uptake in  the mutants was maximal at ph 5. in the mutants succinate uptake was inhibited competitively by monocarboxylic acids. diffusion of succinate or fumarate across  phospholipid membranes (liposomes) was orders of magnitude slower than the transport in the wild-type or the mutants. the data suggest that mutants deficient in dcta, dcua, dcub, dcuc, dcud (or citt) contain a carrier, possibly a monocarboxylate carrier, which is able to transport succinate, but not fumarate,  at acidic ph, when succinate is present as a monoanion. succinate uptake by this  carrier was inhibited by addition of an uncoupler. growth by fumarate respiration (requiring fumarate/succinate antiport) was also lost in the quintuple mutants, and growth was not restored at ph 6. in contrast, the efflux of succinate produced during glucose fermentation was not affected in the mutants, demonstrating that, for succinate efflux, a carrier different from, or in addition to, the known dcu and citt carriers is used.

TI  == a novel system for heterologous expression of flavocytochrome c in phototrophic bacteria using the allochromatium vinosum rbca promoter.
AB  == flavocytochrome c-sulfide dehydrogenase (fcsd), an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of sulfide to elemental sulfur in vitro, is common to bacteria that utilize reduced sulfur compounds as electron donors in the process  of carbon dioxide fixation. fcsd is a heterodimer containing two different cofactors, a flavin (fad) and one or two heme c groups, located on the separate protein subunits. efforts to produce the holoproteins of the soluble allochromatium vinosum fcsd and the membrane-bound ectothiorhodospira vacuolata protein in escherichia coli using several expression systems were unsuccessful. although all systems used were able to export the recombinant fcsds to the periplasm, the proteins did not incorporate heme. in order to develop a new expression system involving photosynthetic hosts (rhodobacter capsulatus, rhodobacter sphaeroides and ect. vacuolata), plasmid mobilisation from e. coli donors was studied. in the search for efficient promoters for such hosts, a system was developed combining the broad-host-range plasmid pgv910 and the promoter of the a. vinosum rubisco gene, rbca. conjugation was used to enable transfer from the expression plasmid of e. coli into rba. capsulatus, rba. sphaeroides strains and into ect. vacuolata. both rhodobacter hosts were able to  transcribe the genes coding for fcsd from the rbca promoter and to produce detectable amounts of recombinant fcsd holoprotein. western blots showed that the best production was obtained from cells grown photosynthetically on malate or acetate with sulfide. this system may prove to be of general use for the production of recombinant c-type cytochromes in homologous or related host systems.

TI  == transmembrane orientation and topology of the nadh:quinone oxidoreductase putative quinone binding subunit nuoh.
AB  == nadh:quinone oxidoreductase, or complex i, is a multi-subunit membrane-bound enzyme in the respiratory chain of many pro- and eukaryotes. the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of nadh and donates electrons to the quinone pool, coupled to proton translocation across the membrane, but the mechanism of energy transduction is not understood. in bacteria the enzyme consists of 14 subunits, seven membrane spanning and seven protruding from the membrane. the hydrophobic nuoh (nqo8, nd1, nad1, ndha) subunit is seemingly involved in quinone binding. a  homologous, structurally and most likely functionally similar subunit is also found in f(420)h2 oxidoreductases and in complex membrane-bound hydrogenases. we  have made theoretical analyses of nuoh and nuoh-like polypeptides and experimentally analyzed the transmembrane topology of the nuoh subunit from rhodobacter capsulatus by constructing and analyzing alkaline phosphatase fusion  proteins. this demonstrated that the nuoh polypeptide has eight transmembrane segments, and four highly conserved hydrophilic sequence motifs facing the inside, bacterial cytoplasm. the n-terminal and c-terminal ends are located on the outside of the membrane. a topology model of nuoh based on these results is presented, and implications from the model are discussed.

TI  == topological analysis of dctq, the small integral membrane protein of the c4-dicarboxylate trap transporter of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == tripartite atp-independent periplasmic ('trap') transporters are a novel group of bacterial and archaeal secondary solute uptake systems which possess a periplasmic binding protein, but which are unrelated to atp-binding cassette (abc) systems. in addition to the binding protein, trap transporters contain two  integral membrane proteins or domains, one of which is 40-50 kda with 12 predicted transmembrane (tm) helices, thought to be the solute import protein, while the other is 20-30 kda and of unknown function. using a series of plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase fusions, we have determined the topology of dctq,  the smaller integral membrane protein from the high-affinity c4-dicarboxylate transporter of rhodobacter capsulatus, which to date is the most extensively characterised trap transporter. dctq was predicted by several topology prediction programmes to have four tm helices with the n- and c-termini located in the cytoplasm. the levels of ampicillin resistance conferred by the fusions when expressed in escherichia coli were found to correlate with this predicted topology. the data have provided a topological model which can be used to test hypotheses concerning the function of the different regions of dctq and which can be applied to other members of the dctq family.

TI  == 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase, the gene product of open reading frame (orf) 2816 and orf 2895 in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == in eubacteria, green algae, and plant chloroplasts, isopentenyl diphosphate, a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, is synthesized by the methylerythritol phosphate pathway. the five carbons of the basic isoprenoid unit are assembled by joining pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. the reaction  is catalyzed by the thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase. in rhodobacter capsulatus, two open reading frames (orfs) carry the genes that encode 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase. orf 2816 is  located in the photosynthesis-related gene cluster, along with most of the genes  required for synthesis of the photosynthetic machinery of the bacterium, whereas  orf 2895 is located elsewhere in the genome. the proteins encoded by orf 2816 and orf 2895, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase a and b, containing a his(6) tag, were synthesized in escherichia coli and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity in two steps. 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase a appears to be a homodimer with 68 kda subunits. a new assay was developed, and the following steady-state kinetic constants were determined for 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase a and b: k(m)(pyruvate) = 0.61 and 3.0 mm, k(m)(d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) = 150 and 120 microm, and v(max) = 1.9 and 1.4 micromol/min/mg in 200 mm sodium citrate (ph 7.4). the orf encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase b complemented the disrupted essential dxs gene in e. coli strain fh11.

AB  == the effect of inactivation of dppa, a dipeptide transport protein identified as a periplasmic molecular chaperone-like protein, on the formation of active dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (dmsor) was examined in rhodobacter sphaeroides f. sp. denitrificans. all of the dppa-disrupted mutants produced a normal level of native form of dmsor and grew by dmso respiration, indicating that the loss of dppa protein alone had no effect on the formation of active dmsor. the periplasmic fraction of the dppa-disrupted mutant also had the activity to prevent aggregation of acid-unfolded dmsor. two proteins, dctp and bzta, were further identified as the proteins with the activity. their activities, however,  were much lower than that of dppa. these results suggest that several substrate binding proteins might be implicated in the folding of unfolded dmsor in the periplasm.

TI  == coordinated, differential expression of two genes through directed mrna cleavage  and stabilization by secondary structures.
AB  == metabolic engineering and multisubunit protein production necessitate the expression of multiple genes at coordinated levels. in bacteria, genes for multisubunit proteins or metabolic pathways are often expressed in operons under  the control of a single promoter; expression of the genes is coordinated by varying transcript stability and the rate of translation initiation. we have developed a system to place multiple genes under the control of a single promoter and produce proteins encoded in that novel operon in different ratios over a range of inducer concentrations. rnase e sites identified in the rhodobacter capsulatus puf operon and escherichia coli pap operon were separately placed between the coding regions of two reporter genes, and novel secondary structures  were engineered into the 5' and 3' ends of the coding regions. the introduced rnase e site directed cleavage between the coding regions to produce two secondary transcripts, each containing a single coding region. the secondary transcripts were protected from exonuclease cleavage by engineered 3' secondary structures, and one of the secondary transcripts was protected from rnase e cleavage by secondary structures at the 5' end. the relative expression levels of two reporter genes could be varied up to fourfold, depending on inducer concentration, by controlling rnase cleavage of the primary and secondary transcripts. coupled with the ability to vary translation initiation by changing  the ribosome binding site, this technology should allow one to create new operons and coordinate, yet separately control, the expression levels of genes expressed  in that operon.

TI  == rnase iii processing of intervening sequences found in helix 9 of 23s rrna in the alpha subclass of proteobacteria.
AB  == we provide experimental evidence for rnase iii-dependent processing in helix 9 of the 23s rrna as a general feature of many species in the alpha subclass of proteobacteria (alpha-proteobacteria). we investigated 12 rhodobacter, rhizobium, sinorhizobium, rhodopseudomonas, and bartonella strains. the processed region is  characterized by the presence of intervening sequences (ivss). the 23s rdna sequences between positions 109 and 205 (escherichia coli numbering) were determined, and potential secondary structures are proposed. comparison of the ivss indicates very different evolutionary rates in some phylogenetic branches, lateral genetic transfer, and evolution by insertion and/or deletion. we show that the ivs processing in rhodobacter capsulatus in vivo is rnase iii-dependent  and that rnase iii cleaves additional sites in vitro. while all ivs-containing transcripts tested are processed in vitro by rnase iii from r. capsulatus, e. coli rnase iii recognizes only some of them as substrates and in these substrates frequently cleaves at different scissile bonds. these results demonstrate the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes. although rnase iii plays an important role in the rrna, mrna, and bacteriophage rna maturation, its substrate specificity is still not well understood. comparison of the ivss of helix 9 does  not hint at sequence motives involved in recognition but reveals that the "antideterminant" model, which represents the most recent attempt to explain the  e. coli rnase iii specificity in vitro, cannot be applied to substrates derived from alpha-proteobacteria.

TI  == uncovering the [2fe2s] domain movement in cytochrome bc1 and its implications for energy conversion.
AB  == in crystals of the key respiratory and photosynthetic electron transfer protein called ubihydroquinone:cytochrome (cyt) c oxidoreductase or cyt bc(1), the extrinsic [2fe2s] cluster domain of its fe-s subunit assumes several conformations, suggesting that it may move during catalysis. herein, using rhodobacter capsulatus mutants that have modifications in the hinge region of this subunit, we were able to reveal this motion kinetically. thus, the bc(1) complex (and possibly the homologous b(6)f complex in chloroplasts) employs the [2fe2s] cluster domain as a device to shuttle electrons from ubihydroquinone to cyt c(1) (or cyt f). we demonstrate that this domain movement is essential for cyt bc(1) function, because a mutant enzyme with a nonmoving fe-s subunit has no  catalytic activity, and one with a slower movement has lower activity. this motion is apparently designed with a natural frequency slow enough to assure productive q(o) site charge separation but fast enough not to be rate limiting. these findings add the unprecedented function of intracomplex electron shuttling  to large-scale domain motions in proteins and may well provide a target for cyt bc(1) antibiotics.

TI  == characterization of a nif-regulated flavoprotein (fpra) from rhodobacter capsulatus. redox properties and molecular interaction with a [2fe-2s] ferredoxin.
AB  == a flavoprotein from rhodobacter capsulatus was purified as a recombinant (his)6-tag fusion from an escherichia coli clone over-expressing the fpra structural gene. the fpra protein is a homodimer containing one molecule of fmn per 48-kda monomer. reduction of the flavoprotein by dithionite showed biphasic kinetics, starting with a fast step of semiquinone (sq) formation, and followed by a slow reduction of the sq. this sq was in the anionic form as shown by epr and optical spectroscopies. spectrophotometric titration gave a midpoint redox potential for the oxidized/sq couple of em1 = +20 mv (ph 8.0), whereas the sq/hydroquinone couple could not be titrated due to the thermodynamic instability of sq associated with its slow reduction process. the inability to detect the intermediate form, sq, upon oxidative titration confirmed this instability and led to an estimate of em2 - em1 of > 80 mv. the reduction of sq by dithionite was significantly accelerated when the [2fe-2s] ferredoxin fdiv was used as redox mediator. the midpoint redox potential of this ferredoxin was determined to be -275 +/- 2 mv at ph 7.5, consistent with fdiv serving as electron donor to fpra in vivo. fdiv and fpra were found to cross-react when incubated together with the 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, giving a covalent complex with an  mr of approximately 60 000. formation of this complex was unaffected by the redox states of the two proteins. other [2fe-2s] ferredoxins, including fdv and fdvi from r. capsulatus, were ineffective as electron carriers to fpra, and cross-reacted poorly with the flavoprotein. the possible function of fpra with regard to nitrogen fixation was investigated using an fpra-deleted mutant. although nitrogenase activity was significantly reduced in the mutant compared with the wild-type strain, nitrogen fixation was apparently unaffected by the fpra deletion even under iron limitation or microaerobic conditions.

AB  == escherichia coli endonuclease viii and endo-nuclease iii are oxidative base excision repair dna glycosylases that remove oxidized pyrimidines from dna. the genes encoding these proteins, nei and nth, are both co-transcribed as the terminal genes in operons. nei is the terminal gene in an operon with four open reading frames that encode proteins of unknown function. this operon has two confirmed transcription initiation sites upstream of the first open reading frame and two transcript termination sites downstream of nei. nth is the terminal gene  in an operon with seven open reading frames that encode proteins of unknown function. the six open reading frames immediately upstream of nth show homology to the genes rnfa, rnfb, rnfc, rnfd, rnfg and rnfe from rhodobacter capsulatis. the rnf genes are required for nitrogen fixation in r.capsulatis and have been predicted to make up a membrane complex involved in electron transport to nitrogenase. the nth operon has transcription initiation sites upstream of the first and second open reading frames and a single transcript termination site downstream of nth. the order of genes in these operons has been conserved or partially conserved in other bacteria, although it is not known whether the genes are co-transcribed in these other organisms.

TI  == novel rhodobacter capsulatus genes required for the biogenesis of various c-type  cytochromes.
AB  == following chemical mutagenesis and screening for the inability to grow by photosynthesis and the absence of cyt cbb3 oxidase activity, two c-type cytochrome (cyt)-deficient mutants, 771 and k2, of rhodobacter capsulatus were isolated. both mutants were completely deficient in all known c-type cyts, and could not be complemented by the previously known cyt c biogenesis genes of r. capsulatus. complementation of 771 and k2 with a wild-type chromosomal library led to the identification of two novel genes, cycj and ccda respectively. the cycj is highly homologous to ccme/cycj, encountered in various gram-negative species. unlike in other species, where cycj is a part of an operon essential for cyt c biogenesis, in r. capsulatus, it is located immediately downstream from argc, involved in arginine biosynthesis. mutation of its universally conserved histidine residue, which is critical for its proposed haem chaperoning role, to an alanine led to loss of its function. all r. capsulatus cycj mutants studied so far excrete copious amounts of coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin when grown on enriched media, suggesting that its product is also a component of the haem delivery branch of cyt c biogenesis in this species. in contrast, the r. capsulatus ccda was homologous to the cyt c biogenesis gene ccda, found in the gram-positive bacterium bacillus subtilis, and to the central region of dipz, encoding a protein disulphide reductase required for cyt c biogenesis in escherichia coli. membrane topology of ccda was established in r. capsulatus using ccda:phoa and ccda :lacz gene fusions. the deduced topology revealed that the two conserved cysteine residues of ccda are, as predicted, membrane embedded. mutagenesis of these cysteines showed that both are required for the function of  ccda in cyt c biogenesis. this study demonstrated for the first time that ccda homologues are also required for cyt c biogenesis in some gram-negative bacteria  such as r. capsulatus.

AB  == individual segments of the polycistronic puf mrna of rhodobacter capsulatus exhibit extremely different half-lives contributing to the stoichiometry of light-harvesting and reaction centre complexes of this facultative phototrophic bacterium. while earlier investigations shed light on the processes leading to the degradation of the 2.7 kb pufbalmx mrna and, consequently, to the formation of the highly stable 0.5 kb pufba mrna processing product, we have now investigated the initial events in the degradation of the highly unstable 3.2 kb  pufqbalmx primary transcript. sequence modifications of two putative rnase e recognition sites within the pufq coding region provide strong evidence that rnase e-mediated cleavage of a sequence at the 3' end of pufq is involved in rate-limiting cleavage of the primary pufqbalmx transcript in vivo. the putative  rnase e recognition sequence at the 5' end of pufq is cleaved in vitro but does not contribute to rate-limiting cleavage in vivo. analysis of the decay of puf mrna segments transcribed from wild-type and mutated puf dna sequences in r. capsulatus and escherichia coli reveal that rnase e-mediated cleavage within the  pufq mrna sequence also affects the stability of the 0.5 kb pufba processing product. these findings demonstrate that the stability of a certain mrna segment  depends on the pathway of processing of its precursor molecule.

TI  == the synthesis of rhodobacter capsulatus hupsl hydrogenase is regulated by the two-component hupt/hupr system.
AB  == the synthesis of the membrane-bound [nife]hydrogenase of rhodobacter capsulatus (hupsl) is regulated negatively by the protein histidine kinase, hupt, and positively by the response regulator, hupr. it is demonstrated in this work that  hupt and hupr are partners in a two-component signal transduction system. the binding of hupr protein to the hups promoter regulatory region (phups ) was studied using gel retardation and footprinting assays. hupr protected a 50 bp region localized upstream from the binding site of the histone-like integration host factor (ihf) regulator. hupr, which belongs to the ntrc subfamily, binds to  an enhancer site (ttg-n5-caa) localized at -162/-152 nt. however, the enhancer-binding hupr protein does not require the rpon sigma factor for transcriptional activation, as is the case for ntrc from enteric bacteria, but functions with sigma70-rna polymerase, as is the case for r. capsulatus ntrc. besides, unlike ntrc from escherichia coli, hupr activates transcription in the unphosphorylated form and becomes inactive by phosphorylation. this was demonstrated by replacing the putative phosphorylation site (d54) of the hupr protein with various amino acids or by deleting it using site-directed mutagenesis. strains expressing mutated hupr genes showed high hydrogenase activities even in the absence of h2, indicating that hupsl transcription is activated by the binding of unphosphorylated hupr protein. strains producing mutated huprd54 proteins were derepressed for hupsl expression as were hupt- mutants. it is shown that the phosphorylated form of hupt was able to transfer phosphate to wild-type hupr protein but not to mutated d54 hupr proteins. thus, it is concluded that hupt and hupr are the partners of a two-component regulatory system that regulates hupsl gene transcription.

AB  == during the screening for rhodobacter capsulatus mutants defective in xanthine degradation, one tn5 mutant which was able to grow with xanthine as a sole nitrogen source only in the presence of high molybdate concentrations (1 mm), a phenotype resembling escherichia coli moga mutants, was identified. unexpectedly, the corresponding tn5 insertion was located within the moea gene. partial dna sequence analysis and interposon mutagenesis of regions flanking r. capsulatus moea revealed that no further genes essential for molybdopterin biosynthesis are  located in the vicinity of moea and revealed that moea forms a monocistronic transcriptional unit in r. capsulatus. amino acid sequence alignments of r. capsulatus moea (414 amino acids [aa]) with e. coli moga (195 aa) showed that moea contains an internal domain homologous to moga, suggesting similar functions of these proteins in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor. interposon mutants defective in moea did not exhibit dimethyl sulfoxide reductase or nitrate reductase activity, which both require the molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (mgd) cofactor, even after addition of 1 mm molybdate to the medium. in contrast, the activity of xanthine dehydrogenase, which binds the molybdopterin (mpt) cofactor, was restored to wild-type levels after the addition of 1 mm molybdate to the growth medium. analysis of fluorescent derivatives of the molybdenum cofactor of purified xanthine dehydrogenase isolated from moea and moda mutant strains, respectively, revealed that mpt is inserted into the enzyme only after molybdenum chelation, and both metal chelation and mo-mpt insertion can occur only under high molybdate concentrations in the absence of moea. these data support a model for the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor in which the biosynthesis of mpt and mgd are split at a stage when the molybdenum atom is added to mpt.

TI  == inactivation and regulation of the aerobic c(4)-dicarboxylate transport (dcta) gene of escherichia coli.
AB  == the gene (dcta) encoding the aerobic c(4)-dicarboxylate transporter (dcta) of escherichia coli was previously mapped to the 79-min region of the linkage map. the nucleotide sequence of this region reveals two candidates for the dcta gene:  f428 at 79.3 min and the o157a-o424-o328 (or orfqmp) operon at 79.9 min. the f428 gene encodes a homologue of the sinorhizobium meliloti and rhizobium leguminosarum h(+)/c(4)-dicarboxylate symporter, dcta, whereas the orfqmp operon  encodes homologues of the aerobic periplasmic-binding protein- dependent c(4)-dicarboxylate transport system (dctq, dctm, and dctp) of rhodobacter capsulatus. to determine which, if either, of these loci specify the e. coli dcta system, the chromosomal f428 and orfm genes were inactivated by inserting sp(r) or ap(r) cassettes, respectively. the resulting f428 mutant was unable to grow aerobically with fumarate or malate as the sole carbon source and grew poorly with succinate. furthermore, fumarate uptake was abolished in the f428 mutant and succinate transport was approximately 10-fold lower than that of the wild type. the growth and fumarate transport deficiencies of the f428 mutant were complemented by transformation with an f428-containing plasmid. no growth defect  was found for the orfm mutant. in combination, the above findings confirm that f428 corresponds to the dcta gene and indicate that the orfqmp products play no role in c(4)-dicarboxylate transport. regulation studies with a dcta-lacz (f428-lacz) transcriptional fusion showed that dcta is subject to cyclic amp receptor protein (crp)-dependent catabolite repression and arca-mediated anaerobic repression and is weakly induced by the dcus-dcur system in response to c(4)-dicarboxylates and citrate. interestingly, in a dcta mutant, expression of dcta is constitutive with respect to c(4)-dicarboxylate induction, suggesting that dcta regulates its own synthesis. northern blot analysis revealed a single,  monocistronic dcta transcript and confirmed that dcta is subject to regulation by catabolite repression and crp. reverse transcriptase-mediated primer extension indicated a single transcriptional start site centered 81 bp downstream of a strongly predicted crp-binding site.

TI  == characterization of a molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic gene cluster in rhodobacter capsulatus which is specific for the biogenesis of dimethylsulfoxide  reductase.
AB  == the dmso reductase of rhodobacter capsulatus contains a pterin molybdenum cofactor (moco) and is located in the periplasm. dna sequence analysis identified four genes involved in the biosynthesis of the moco (moaa, moad, moeb and moac) immediately downstream of the dor (dmso respiratory) gene cluster. rhodobacter capsulatus moaa was expressed in escherichia coli as a his6-tagged protein. although, the expressed protein formed inclusion bodies, epr spectroscopy showed  that moaa contains a [3fe-4s] cluster. a moaa mutant was constructed and its phenotype indicates that the moco biosynthetic gene cluster downstream of the dor operon is specific for the biogenesis of dmso reductase. two forms of dmso reductase were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from the moaa mutant. a  mature form of dmso reductase was located in the periplasm and a precursor form was found in the cytoplasm.

TI  == mutational analysis of the dimethylsulfoxide respiratory (dor) operon of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == four genes, dorc, dord, dorb and dorr of the dmso respiratory gene cluster of rhodobacter capsulatus have been identified and sequenced. dorc encodes a pentahaem c-type cytochrome of the nirt class and the derived dorc protein sequence shows highest similarity to torc from the escherichia coli trimethylamine-n-oxide (tmao) respiratory system. mutagenesis of dorc resulted in the loss of a 46 kda haem-staining polypeptide from membranes of r. capsulatus. dord encodes a protein with highest sequence similarity to tord from the e. coli  tmao respiratory system. dmso reductase polypeptide (dora) could not be detected  in cell-free extracts of a dord mutant and it is suggested that dord has a role in stabilizing the dora apo-protein prior to insertion of the pterin molybdenum cofactor. dorb encodes a protein with highest sequence similarity to napd of paracoccus denitrificans. mutagenesis of dorb reduced the activity of dmso reductase and led to the accumulation of a larger form of the enzyme that is presumed to represent a cytoplasmic precursor polypeptide. it is suggested that dorb has a role in the biogenesis of dmso reductase prior to its secretion into the periplasm. dorr is transcribed in the opposite direction to dorc. the derived amino acid sequence of dorr indicates that it is a response regulator and mutation of dorr shows that it is essential for expression of the dorcda operon.  expression of a chromosomal dora::lacz fusion was also dependent on the transcriptional regulator fnr. the intergenic region between dorr and dorc contains four putative binding sites for dorr but no binding site for fnr was identified.

TI  == isolation of helicobacter pylori genes that modulate urease activity.
AB  == helicobacter pylori urease, a nickel-requiring metalloenzyme, hydrolyzes urea to  nh3 and co2. we sought to identify h. pylori genes that modulate urease activity  by constructing php8080, a plasmid which encodes both h. pylori urease and the nixa nickel transporter. escherichia coli se5000 and dh5alpha transformed with php8080 resulted in a high-level urease producer and a low-level urease producer, respectively. an h. pylori dna library was cotransformed into se5000 (php8080) and dh5alpha (php8080) and was screened for cotransformants expressing either lowered or heightened urease activity, respectively. among the clones carrying urease-enhancing factors, 21 of 23 contained hp0548, a gene that potentially encodes a dna helicase found within the cag pathogenicity island, and hp0511, a gene that potentially encodes a lipoprotein. each of these genes, when subcloned, conferred a urease-enhancing activity in e. coli (php8080) compared with the vector control. among clones carrying urease-decreasing factors, 11 of 13 clones  contained the flba (also known as flha) flagellar biosynthesis/regulatory gene (hp1041), an lcrd homolog. the lcrd protein family is involved in type iii secretion and flagellar secretion in pathogenic bacteria. almost no urease activity was detected in e. coli (php8080) containing the subcloned flba gene. furthermore, there was significantly reduced synthesis of the urease structural subunits in e. coli (php8080) containing the flba gene, as determined by western  blot analysis with urea and ureb antiserum. thus, flagellar biosynthesis and urease activity may be linked in h. pylori. these results suggest that h. pylori  genes may modulate urease activity.

TI  == in vivo transposition of mariner-based elements in enteric bacteria and mycobacteria.
AB  == mariner family transposons are widespread among eukaryotic organisms. these transposons are apparently horizontally transmitted among diverse eukaryotes and  can also transpose in vitro in the absence of added cofactors. here we show that  transposons derived from the mariner element himar1 can efficiently transpose in  bacteria in vivo. we have developed simple transposition systems by using minitransposons, made up of short inverted repeats flanking antibiotic resistance markers. these elements can efficiently transpose after expression of transposase from an appropriate bacterial promoter. we found that transposition of mariner-based elements in escherichia coli produces diverse insertion mutations in either a targeted plasmid or a chromosomal gene. with himar1-derived transposons we were able to isolate phage-resistant mutants of both e. coli and mycobacterium smegmatis. mariner-based transposons will provide valuable tools for mutagenesis and genetic manipulation of bacteria that currently lack well developed genetic systems.

TI  == the structural and functional organization of h-ns-like proteins is evolutionarily conserved in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the structural gene of the h-ns protein, a global regulator of bacterial metabolism, has been identified in the group of enterobacteria as well as in closely related bacteria, such as erwinia chrysanthemi and haemophilus influenzae. isolated outside these groups, the bph3 protein of bordetella pertussis exhibits a low amino acid conservation with h-ns, particularly in the n-terminal domain. to obtain information on the structure, function and/or evolution of h-ns, we searched for other h-ns-related proteins in the latest databases. we found that hvra, a trans-activator protein in rhodobacter capsulatus, has a low but significant similarity with h-ns and h-ns-like proteins. this gram-negative bacterium is phylogenetically distant from escherichia coli. using theoretical analysis (e.g. secondary structure prediction and dna binding domain modelling) of the amino acid sequence of h-ns, stpa (an h-ns-like protein in e. coli), bph3 and hvra and by in vivo and in vitro experiments (e.g. complementation of various h-ns-related phenotypes and competitive gel shift assay), we present evidence that these proteins belong to the same class of dna binding proteins. in silico analysis suggests that this family also includes spb in r. sphaeroides, xrva in xanthomonas oryzae and vich in vibrio cholerae. these results demonstrate that proteins structurally and functionally related to h-ns are widespread in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == identification and characterization of a two-component sensor-kinase and response-regulator system (dcus-dcur) controlling gene expression in response to  c4-dicarboxylates in escherichia coli.
AB  == the dcub gene of escherichia coli encodes an anaerobic c4-dicarboxylate transporter that is induced anaerobically by fnr, activated by the cyclic amp receptor protein, and repressed in the presence of nitrate by narl. in addition,  dcub expression is strongly induced by c4-dicarboxylates, suggesting the presence of a novel c4-dicarboxylate-responsive regulator in e. coli. this paper describes the isolation of a tn10 mutant in which the 160-fold induction of dcub expression by c4-dicarboxylates is absent. the corresponding tn10 mutation resides in the yjdh gene, which is adjacent to the yjdg gene and close to the dcub gene at approximately 93.5 min in the e. coli chromosome. the yjdhg genes (redesignated dcusr) appear to constitute an operon encoding a two-component sensor-regulator system (dcus-dcur). a plasmid carrying the dcusr operon restored the c4-dicarboxylate inducibility of dcub expression in the dcus mutant to levels exceeding those of the dcus+ strain by approximately 1.8-fold. the dcus mutation  affected the expression of other genes with roles in c4-dicarboxylate transport or metabolism. expression of the fumarate reductase (frdabcd) operon and the aerobic c4-dicarboxylate transporter (dcta) gene were induced 22- and 4-fold, respectively, by the dcus-dcur system in the presence of c4-dicarboxylates. surprisingly, anaerobic fumarate respiratory growth of the dcus mutant was normal. however, under aerobic conditions with c4-dicarboxylates as sole carbon sources, the mutant exhibited a growth defect resembling that of a dcta mutant. studies employing a dcua dcub dcuc triple mutant unable to transport c4-dicarboxylates anaerobically revealed that c4-dicarboxylate transport is not required for c4-dicarboxylate-responsive gene regulation. this suggests that the  dcus-dcur system responds to external substrates. accordingly, topology studies using 14 dcus-blam fusions showed that dcus contains two putative transmembrane helices flanking a approximately 140-residue n-terminal domain apparently located in the periplasm. this topology strongly suggests that the periplasmic loop of dcus serves as a c4-dicarboxylate sensor. the cytosolic region of dcus (residues  203 to 543) contains two domains: a central pas domain possibly acting as a second sensory domain and a c-terminal transmitter domain. database searches showed that dcus and dcur are closely related to a subgroup of two-component sensor-regulators that includes the citrate-responsive cita-citb system of klebsiella pneumoniae. dcus is not closely related to the c4-dicarboxylate-sensing dcts or dctb protein of rhodobacter capsulatus or rhizobial species, respectively. although all three proteins have similar topologies and functions, and all are members of the two-component sensor-kinase  family, their periplasmic domains appear to have evolved independently.

AB  == in the present work we report the high-level expression of foreign genes encoding the light-harvesting (lhii) membrane-spanning polypeptides in photosynthetic bacteria. to do this we first constructed three deletion strains of rhodovulum (rhv.) sulfidophilum in which all or part of the puc operon, encoding the peripheral light-harvesting proteins, is missing. to investigate the heterologous expression of the light-harvesting polypeptides from rb. capsulatus in rhv. sulfidophilum and vice versa we have reintroduced functional foreign lh genes into these and equivalent strains of rhodobacter (rb.) capsulatus. in some cases  very high levels of expression were obtained (85%) of those observed in the wild  type), while in other cases much lower expression was observed; possible reasons  for these differences are discussed. the heterologously expressed proteins were shown to contain normal pigment-binding sites and to be normally and functionally integrated within the host photosynthetic apparatus. the results indicate that heterologous proteins are able to assemble properly and enter into the same protein-protein interactions as their analogs originally present in the host strain.

TI  == characterization of cytochrome c-556 from the purple phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus as a cytochrome-c peroxidase.
AB  == a cytochrome c-556 was purified from rhodobacter capsulatus and the complete amino acid sequence was determined. it contains 328 amino acid residues and two typical heme-binding sites at cysteine residues 54 and 57 and at residues 200 and 203. it is homologous to the family of bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases (bccp)  with 69% identity to paracoccus denitrificans bccp and 60% identity to pseudomonas aeruginosa bccp for which there is a three-dimensional structure. there is lesser similarity to the maug gene products from methylotrophic bacteria which are thought to be involved in biosynthesis of the quinone cofactor of methylamine dehydrogenase. translated genes from escherichia coli and helicobacter pylori are also related to the bacterial cytochrome c peroxidases. the divergence of this family of proteins is reflected in the fact that the reported sixth heme ligands are not conserved, except in pseudomonas, rhodobacter and paracoccus. this suggests that homologs of bccp may fold differently and/or may not have the same enzymatic activity as the prototypic protein from ps. aeruginosa. we found that the rb. capsulatus bccp is active with both rb. capsulatus cytochrome c2 and with horse cytochrome c as substrates (km values 60  microm and 6 microm, respectively). the turnover number was 40 s(-1) and the km for peroxide was 33 microm. we have thus confirmed that the rb. capsulatus protein is a cytochrome c peroxidase.

AB  == nadh-quinone 1 oxidoreductase (complex i) isolated from bovine heart mitochondria was, until recently, the major source for the study of this most complicated energy transducing device in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. complex i has been shown to contain 43 subunits and possesses a molecular mass of about 1 million. recently, complex i genes have been cloned and sequenced from several bacterial sources including escherichia coli, paracoccus denitrificans, rhodobacter capsulatus and thermus thermophilus hb-8. these enzymes are less complicated than the bovine enzyme, containing a core of 13 or 14 subunits homologous to the bovine heart complex i. from this data, important clues concerning the subunit location of both the substrate binding site and intrinsic  redox centers have been gleaned. powerful molecular genetic approaches used in these bacterial systems can identify structure/function relationships concerning  the redox components of complex i. site-directed mutants at the level of bacterial chromosomes and over-expression and purification of single subunits have allowed detailed analysis of the amino acid residues involved in ligand binding to several iron-sulfur clusters. therefore, it has become possible to examine which subunits contain individual iron-sulfur clusters, their location within the enzyme and what their ligand residues are. the discovery of g=2.00 epr signals arising from two distinct species of semiquinone (sq) in the activated bovine heart submitochondrial particles (smp) is another line of recent progress. the intensity of semiquinone signals is sensitive to deltamicroh+ and is diminished by specific inhibitors of complex i. to date, semiquinones similar to  those reported for the bovine heart mitochondrial complex i have not yet been discovered in the bacterial systems. this mini-review describes three aspects of  the recent progress in the study of the redox components of complex i: (a) the location of the substrate (nadh) binding site, flavin, and most of the iron-sulfur clusters, which have been identified in the hydrophilic electron entry domain of complex i; (b) experimental evidence indicating that the cluster  n2 is located in the amphipathic domain of complex i, connecting the promontory and membrane parts. very recent data is also presented suggesting that the cluster n2 may have a unique ligand structure with an atypical cluster-ligation sequence motif located in the nuob (nqo6/psst) subunit rather than in the long advocated nuoi (nqo9/tyky) subunit. the latter subunit contains the most primordial sequence motif for two tetranuclear clusters; (c) the discovery of spin-spin interactions between cluster n2 and two distinct complex i-associated species of semiquinone. based on the splitting of the g1 signal of the cluster n2 and concomitant strong enhancement of the semiquinone spin relaxation, one semiquinone species was localized 8-11 a from the cluster n2 within the inner membrane on the matrix side (n-side). spin relaxation of the other semiquinone species is much less enhanced, and thus it was proposed to have a longer distance from the cluster n2, perhaps located closer to the other side (p-side) surface of the membrane. a brief introduction of epr technique was also described in appendix a of this mini-review.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide and its analog antagonists display differential serum factor dependencies for induction of cytokine genes in murine macrophages.
AB  == monocytes/macrophages play a central role in mediating the effects of lipopolysaccharide (lps) derived from gram-negative bacteria by the production of proinflammatory mediators. recently, it was shown that the expression of cytokine genes for tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), interleukin-1beta (il-1beta),  and interferon-inducible protein-10 (ip-10) by murine macrophages in response to  low concentrations of lps is entirely cd14 dependent. in this report, we show that murine macrophages respond to low concentrations of lps (</=2 ng/ml) in the  complete absence of serum, leading to the induction of tnf-alpha and il-1beta genes. in contrast to the tnf-alpha and il-1beta genes, the ip-10 gene is poorly  induced in the absence of serum. the addition of recombinant human soluble cd14 (rscd14) had very little effect on the levels of serum-free, lps-induced tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and ip-10 genes. in contrast, the addition of recombinant human lps-binding protein (rlbp) had opposing effects on the lps-induced tnf-alpha or il-1beta and ip-10 genes. rlbp inhibited lps-induced tnf-alpha and il-1beta genes, while it reconstituted ip-10 gene expression to levels induced in the presence of serum. these results provide further evidence that the induction  of tnf-alpha or il-1beta genes occurs via a pathway that is distinct from one that leads to the induction of the ip-10 gene and that the pathways diverge at the level of the initial interaction between lps and cellular cd14. additionally, the results presented here indicate that lps structural analog antagonists rhodobacter sphaeroides diphosphoryl lipid a and sdz 880. 431 are able to inhibit lps-induced tnf-alpha and il-1beta in the absence of serum, while a synthetic analog of rhodobacter capsulatus lipid a (b 975) requires both rscd14 and rlbp to function as an inhibitor.

TI  == overexpression in escherichia coli of the rnf genes from rhodobacter capsulatus--characterization of two membrane-bound iron-sulfur proteins.
AB  == the rnf genes of rhodobacter capsulatus, essential for nitrogen fixation, are thought to encode a system for electron transport to nitrogenase. in the present  study, we have attempted to overexpress the rnf genes in escherichia coli to investigate the molecular properties of the corresponding proteins. corrections were made to the published dna sequence of the rnf operon, resulting in the identification of two genes, rnfg and rnfh. the rnfabcdgeh operon thus comprises  seven genes and shows similarities in gene arrangement and deduced protein sequences to homologous regions in the genomes of haemophilus influenzae and e. coli. four of the rnf gene products were found to be similar in sequence to components of an na+-dependent nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase from vibrio alginolyticus. three of the rnf genes were successfully overexpressed in e. coli  as his-tagged polypeptides, whereas the products of rnfa, rnfd and rnfe, predicted to be transmembrane proteins, could not be stably maintained in e. coli. the rnfb and rnfc gene products were isolated as two brown proteins with apparent molecular-mass values of 25 kda and 55 kda, respectively. rnfb was shown to contain one [2fe-2s] cluster, based on absorption spectrophotometry, epr spectroscopy and iron content. recombinant rnfc contained at least one iron-sulfur cluster, most likely of the [4fe-4s] type. unambiguous identification of the prosthetic groups was, however, precluded by the extreme instability of this protein. in r. capsulatus, rnfb and rnfc were found by immunoblot analysis to be tightly bound to the membrane, despite their hydrophilic character. the rnfb and rnfc proteins were absent in mutant strains bearing insertions at various positions within the rnfabcdgeh operon, suggesting that their stability depends on the cosynthesis of the other rnf gene products. we observed that iron  limitation during growth resulted in a decrease both in the cellular content of rnfb and in the level of transcription of the rnfabcdgeh operon, indicating that  the expression of this operon is regulated as a function of iron availability.

TI  == the atp synthase atphagdc (f1) operon from rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the atphagdc operon of rhodobacter capsulatus, containing the five genes coding for the f1 sector of the atp synthase, has been cloned and sequenced. the promoter region has been defined by primer extension analysis. it was not possible to obtain viable cells carrying atp deletions in the r. capsulatus chromosome, indicating that genes coding for atp synthase are essential, at least under the growth conditions tested. we were able to circumvent this problem by combining gene transfer agent transduction with conjugation. this method represents an easy way to construct strains carrying mutations in indispensable genes.

TI  == the rhodobacter capsulatus hupslc promoter: identification of cis-regulatory elements and of trans-activating factors involved in h2 activation of hupslc transcription.
AB  == the [nife]hydrogenase of the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus is encoded by the structural hupslc operon, the expression of which is induced by h2. h2 activation was no longer observable in chromosomal hupr mutants, an indication that hupr is implicated directly in the activation by h2 of hups gene  expression. the transcriptional start site of the hups promoter, determined by primer extension mapping, was located 55 nucleotides upstream from the translational start codon of the hups gene. regulatory sequences were identified  by serial 5' deletions of the 300bp hups promoter-regulatory region (phups) and phups-lacz translational fusions. cis-regulatory sequences capable of interacting with two transcription factors, ihf and hupr, a response regulator of the ntrc subfamily, were studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (emsas). the r.  capsulatus ihf and hupr proteins were overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. ihf binds to a site, 5'-tcacacaccattg, centred at -87 nt from the transcription start site. the hupr protein binds to one site within the -162 to -152 nt region, which contains the palindromic sequence 5'-ttg-r5-caa. by the use of 5' deletions and site-directed mutagenesis  of the -162/-152 region, this palindrome was shown to be required for in vivo hups transcriptional activation by h2.

TI  == molybdate transport and regulation in bacteria.
AB  == molybdate is transported in bacteria by a high-affinity transport system composed of a periplasmic binding protein, an integral membrane protein, and an energizer  protein. these three proteins are coded by moda, modb, and modc genes, respectively. the moda, modb, and modc proteins from various organisms (escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, azotobacter vinelandii, and rhodobacter capsulatus) are very similar. the lowest km value reported for molybdate in the molybdate transport process is approximately 50 nm. in a mod mutant, molybdate is transported by the sulfate transport system or by a nonspecific anion transporter. molybdate transport is tightly coupled to utilization in e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, while other dinitrogen-fixing organisms appear to have a molybdenum storage protein. in all organisms studied so far, molybdate transport genes are regulated by a repressor protein, mode. the mode-molybdate complex binds to the sequences tayat (y = t or c) in the operator/ promoter region in e. coli and prevents transcription of the modabcd operon. the  mode-molybdate complex binds to dna as a homodimer in e. coli and possibly in other organisms as well. in r. capsulatus, however, two mode homologues (mopab proteins) are required for repression.

TI  == characterization of the rhodobacter capsulatus housekeeping rna polymerase. in vitro transcription of photosynthesis and other genes.
AB  == to begin to characterize biochemically the transcriptional activation systems in  photosynthetic bacteria, the rhodobacter capsulatus rna polymerase (rnap) that contains the sigma70 factor (r. capsulatus rnap/sigma70) was purified and characterized using two classical sigma70 type promoters, the bacteriophage t7a1  and the rna i promoters. transcription from these promoters was sensitive to rifampicin, rnase, and monoclonal antibody 2g10 (directed against the escherichia coli sigma70 subunit). specific transcripts were detected in vitro for r. capsulatus cytochrome c2 (cyca) and fructose-inducible (frub) promoters and genes induced in photosynthesis (puf and puc) and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis (bchc). alignment of these natural promoters activated by r. capsulatus rnap/sigma70 indicated a preference for the sequence ttgac at the -35 region for  strong in vitro transcription. to test the -35 recognition pattern, the r. capsulatus nifa1 promoter, which exhibits only three of the five consensus nucleotides at the -35 region, was mutated to four and five of the consensus nucleotides. although the nifa1 wild type promoter showed no transcription, the double mutated promoter exhibited high levels of in vitro transcription by the purified r. capsulatus rnap/sigma70 enzyme. similarities and differences between  the rnaps and the promoters of r. capsulatus and e. coli are discussed.

TI  == cloning of the sdsa gene encoding solanesyl diphosphate synthase from rhodobacter capsulatus and its functional expression in escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  == different organisms produce different species of isoprenoid quinones, each with its own distinctive length. these differences in length are commonly exploited in microbial classification. the side chain length of quinone is determined by the nature of the polyprenyl diphosphate synthase that catalyzes the reaction. to determine if the side chain length of ubiquinone (uq) has any distinct role to play in the metabolism of the cells in which it is found, we cloned the solanesyl diphosphate synthase gene (sdsa) from rhodobacter capsulatus sb1003 and expressed it in escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae. sequence analysis revealed that the sdsa gene encodes a 325-amino-acid protein which has similarity (27 to 40%) with other prenyl diphosphate synthases. expression of the sdsa gene complemented a defect in the octaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene of e. coli and  the nonrespiratory phenotype resulting from a defect in the hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene of s. cerevisiae. both e. coli and s. cerevisiae expressing the sdsa gene mainly produced solanesyl diphosphate, which resulted in the synthesis of uq-9 without any noticeable effect on the growth of the cells. thus, it appears that uq-9 can replace the function of uq-8 in e. coli and uq-6 in s. cerevisiae. taken together with previous results, the results described here imply that the side chain length of uq is not a critical factor for the survival of microorganisms.

TI  == the amino-terminal portion of the rieske iron-sulfur protein contributes to the ubihydroquinone oxidation site catalysis of the rhodobacter capsulatus bc1 complex.
AB  == the rieske iron-sulfur (fe-s) protein subunit of bc1 complexes contains in its carboxyl-terminal part two highly conserved hexapeptide motifs (box i and box ii) that include the four amino acid ligands of its [2fe-2s] cluster. in the preceding paper [liebl, u., sled, v., brasseur, g., ohnishi, t., & daldal, f. (1997) biochemistry 36, 11675-11684], the effects of mutations at two of the nonliganding residues [threonine (t) 134 and leucine (l) 136 in the rhodobactercapsulatus rieske fe-s protein] of box i have been described. in this  work, interactions between the occupants of the qo site of the bc1 complex (uq/uqh2 and the inhibitors stigmatellin and myxothiazol) and the [2fe-2s] cluster of the rieske fe-s protein were probed by isolating photosynthesis-proficient (ps+) revertants of the ps- mutants l136r, -h, -d and -g. these revertants contained either a single substitution at the original position 136 or an additional mutation located in the amino-terminal part of the  fe-s protein at either position 44 or 46. the same-site revertants l136a and -y grew well under photosynthetic conditions and contained highly active bc1 complexes but exhibited modified epr spectra both in the presence and in the absence of stigmatellin. unexpectedly, they were highly resistant to stigmatellin (stir) and hypersensitive to myxothiazol (myxhs) in vivo, demonstrating for the first time that mutations located in the fe-s subunit confer resistance to stigmatellin. the [2fe-2s] cluster of the same-site revertants responded weakly to the qpool redox state and had redox midpoint potential (em7) values (around 265 mv) lower than those of their wild type counterpart (about 310 mv). on the other hand, the second-site revertants l136h/v44l, l136g/v44f, and l136g/a46t, -v, or -p supported photosynthetic growth poorly, were stir and myxhs, and contained barely active bc1 complexes. like the same-site revertants, they exhibited modified epr spectra both in the presence and in the absence of stigmatellin and had perturbed qo site occupancy. in addition, they contained substoichiometric amounts of the fe-s protein with respect to the other subunits  of the bc1 complex. the em7 values of the [2fe-2s] cluster of these double mutants were lower (around 245 mv) than that of the wild type strain but appreciably higher than those of their ps- parents (about 200 mv for l136g). in order to define the molecular nature of the suppression mediated by the second-site mutations, the single mutants v44l and -f and a46t and -v were constructed in the absence of the original mutations at position 136. these mutants behaved like a wild type strain with respect to their ps+ growth ability, inhibitor sensitivity, epr spectra of their [2fe-2s] cluster, and response to stigmatellin or to the qpool redox state. but surprisingly, the em7 values of their [2fe-2s] cluster were much higher (about 385 mv) than that of a wild type strain. these findings demonstrated for the first time that the amino-terminal part of the rieske fe-s protein encompassing residues 44 and 46 is important not  only for the structure and function of the qo site of the bc1 complex but also for the properties of its [2fe-2s] cluster.

TI  == conserved nonliganding residues of the rhodobacter capsulatus rieske iron-sulfur  protein of the bc1 complex are essential for protein structure, properties of the [2fe-2s] cluster, and communication with the quinone pool.
AB  == the iron-sulfur (fe-s) protein subunit of the bc1 complex, known as the rieske protein, contains a high-potential [2fe-2s] cluster ligated by two nitrogen and two sulfur atoms to its apoprotein. earlier work indicated that in rhodobacter capsulatus these atoms are provided by two cysteine (c133 and c153) and two histidine (h135 and h156) residues, located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein [davidson, e., ohnishi, t., atta-asafo-adjei, e., & daldal, f. (1992) biochemistry 31, 3342-3351]. these ligands are part of the conserved sequences c133thlgc138 (box i) and c153pchgs158 (box ii) and affect the properties of the fe-s protein and its [2fe-2s] cluster. in this work, the role of amino acid side  chains at positions 134 and 136, adjacent to the cluster ligands in box i, was probed by using site-directed mutagenesis and biophysical analyses. these positions were substituted with r, d, h, and g to probe the effect of charged, polar, large, and small amino acid side chains on the properties of the [2fe-2s]  cluster. of the mutants obtained t134r, -h, and -g were photosynthetically competent (ps+) but contained fe-s proteins with redox midpoint potentials (em7)  50-100 mv lower than that of a wild type strain. in contrast, t134d was ps- and contained no detectable [2fe-2s] cluster, although it reverted frequently to ps+  by substitution of d with n. on the other hand, all l136 mutants were ps-, the epr characteristics of their [2fe-2s] cluster were perturbed, and they were unable to sense the qpool redox state or to bind stigmatellin properly. the overall data indicated that replacement of the amino acid side chain at position  134 of the fe-s protein affects mainly the em7 and oxygen sensitivity of the [2fe-2s] cluster without abolishing its function, while substitutions at position 136 perturb drastically its ability to monitor the qpool redox state and its interaction with the qo site inhibitor stigmatellin. these two distinct phenotypes of box i t134 and l136 mutants are discussed with regard to the recently published three-dimensional structure of the water soluble part of the bovine heart mitochondrial rieske fe-s protein.

TI  == distribution of a sub-class of bacterial abc polar amino acid transporter and identification of an n-terminal region involved in solute specificity.
AB  == a new sub-class of binding protein-dependent transporter with specificity for a broad range of polar amino acids has been identified by sequence comparison, in rhizobium leguminosarum, rhodobacter capsulatus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescens. southern blotting and pcr analysis has shown that transporters from  this new sub-class are widely distributed in gram-negative bacteria, including, in addition to the above, citrobacter freundii, erwinia carotovorum and rhizobium meliloti. abc transporters of polar amino acids can be divided into two groups: those with narrow solute specificity and the newly identified sub-class with broad solute specificity. the binding and inner membrane proteins from transporters with a broad solute specificity are larger by approximately 30% than those with a narrow solute specificity. multiple alignment of the inner membrane  proteins from all sequenced polar amino acid transporters indicates there is an n-terminal conserved region that may be involved in solute specificity. a conserved arginine or lysine at residue 30 of this region is changed to glutamate in arginine transporters. residue 53 also has a strong correlation with the charge on the transported solute, with basic amino acid transporters replacing an aliphatic amino acid at this position with a negatively charged amino acid. the general amino acid permease from r. leguminosarum, which will transport aliphatic as well as basic and acidic amino acids, juxtaposes two prolines at residues 52 and 53 of the n-terminal conserved region.

TI  == a thioreduction pathway tethered to the membrane for periplasmic cytochromes c biogenesis; in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == the c-type cytochromes are distinguished from other heme proteins by the covalent ligation of two heme vinyl groups to two cysteine residues on the apoprotein (at  a cxxch domain). the present study was undertaken to elucidate the roles and topological locations of two of the proteins necessary for cytochrome c biogenesis, the helx and ccl2 proteins in the gram-negative bacteria rhodobacter  capsulatus. from their primary sequence, each of these proteins has a cxxc motif  that could be involved in the reduction of the cysteine residues of the apocytochromes c, a prerequisite for covalent ligation to the heme. results of site-directed mutagenesis of helx and ccl2 demonstrate that each cysteine residue is required for the in vivo function of the protein. we demonstrate that the native helx in r. capsulatus is tethered to the cytoplasmic membrane via its uncleaved signal sequence. ccl2 is tethered by a single transmembrane domain present in the c terminus with the n-terminal two-thirds of the protein in the periplasm. thus, both cxxc motifs are exposed to the periplasm. the complete helx protein and the soluble n-terminal portion of ccl2 (called ccl2*) were overproduced and purified from periplasmic fractions. the ccl2* signal sequence is efficiently processed. in vitro studies with these purified proteins indicate  that although neither can reduce insulin, helx can reduce the ccl2 cysteine residues and the ccl2 cysteine residues are oxidized by an apocytochrome c peptide containing the cxxch domain. revertants of an helx deletion mutant were isolated that regain the ability to make c-type cytochromes (and thus grow photosynthetically); some of these suppressor strains are enhanced for photosynthetic growth by the addition of thio-reducing agents. in contrast, revertants of a ccl2 deletion strain could not be isolated under any condition. these results suggest that the helx and ccl2 proteins form a thioreduction pathway (helx-->ccl2-->apocytochrome c) whereby ccl2 function may be highly specific for apocytochromes c while helx may act as a more general reductant of proteins with vicinal cysteines.

TI  == trap transporters: a new family of periplasmic solute transport systems encoded by the dctpqm genes of rhodobacter capsulatus and by homologs in diverse gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the dct locus of rhodobacter capsulatus encodes a high-affinity transport system  for the c4-dicarboxylates malate, succinate, and fumarate. the nucleotide sequence of the region downstream of the previously sequenced dctp gene (encoding a periplasmic c4-dicarboxylate-binding protein) was determined. two open reading  frames (orfs) of 681 bp (dctq) and 1,320 bp (dctm) were identified as additional  dct genes by insertional mutagenesis and complementation studies. dctq (24,763 da) and dctm (46,827 da) had hydropathic profiles consistent with the presence of 4 and 12 potential transmembrane segments, respectively, and were localized in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction after heterologous expression of the dctqm orfs in escherichia coli. dctp, dctq, and dctm were found to be unrelated to known transport proteins in the abc (atp-binding cassette) superfamily but were shown to be homologous with the products of previously unidentified orfs in a number of gram-negative bacteria, including bordetella pertussis, e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, haemophilus influenzae, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803. an additional orf (rypa) downstream of dctm encodes a protein with sequence similarity to eukaryotic protein-tyrosine phosphatases, but interposon mutagenesis of this orf did not result in a dct- phenotype. complementation of a  rhizobium meliloti dctabd deletion mutant by heterologous expression of the dctpqm genes from r. capsulatus demonstrated that no additional structural genes  were required to form a functional transport system. transport via the dct system was vanadate insensitive, and in uncoupler titrations with intact cells, the decrease in the rate of succinate transport correlated closely with the fall in membrane potential but not with the cellular atp concentration, implying that the proton motive force, rather than atp hydrolysis, drives uptake. it is concluded that the r. capsulatus dct system is a new type of periplasmic secondary transporter and that similar, hitherto-unrecognized systems are widespread in gram-negative bacteria. the name trap (for tripartite atp-independent periplasmic) transporters is proposed for this new group.

TI  == structure of the puf operon of the obligately aerobic, bacteriochlorophyll alpha-containing bacterium roseobacter denitrificans och114 and its expression in a rhodobacter capsulatus puf puc deletion mutant.
AB  == roseobacter denitrificans (erythrobacter species strain och114) synthesizes bacteriochlorophyll a (bchl) and the photosynthetic apparatus only in the presence of oxygen and is unable to carry out primary photosynthetic reactions and to grow photosynthetically under anoxic conditions. the puf operon of r. denitrificans has the same five genes in the same order as in many photosynthetic bacteria, i.e., pufbalmc. pufc, the tetraheme subunit of the reaction center (rc), consists of 352 amino acids (mr, 39,043); 20 and 34% of the total amino acids are identical to those of pufc of chloroflexus aurantiacus and rubrivivax gelatinosus, respectively. the n-terminal hydrophobic domain is probably responsible for anchoring the subunit in the membrane. four heme-binding domains  are homologous to those of pufc in several purple bacteria. sequences similar to  pufq and pufx of rhodobacter capsulatus were not detected on the chromosome of r. denitrificans. the puf operon of r. denitrificans was expressed in trans in escherichia coli, and all gene products were synthesized. the roseobacter puf operon was also expressed in r. capsulatus ck11, a puf puc double-deletion mutant. for the first time, an rc/light-harvesting complex i core complex was heterologously synthesized. the strongest expression of the r. denitrificans puf  operon was observed under the control of the r. capsulatus puf promoter, in the presence of pufq and pufx and in the absence of pufc. charge recombination between the primary donor p+ and the primary ubiquinone q(a)- was observed in the transconjugant, showing that the m and l subunits of the rc were correctly assembled. the transconjugants did not grow photosynthetically under anoxic conditions.

TI  == a new nos gene downstream from nosdfy is essential for dissimilatory reduction of nitrous oxide by rhizobium (sinorhizobium) meliloti.
AB  == rhizobium (sinorhizobium) meliloti strains capable of dissimilatory nitrous oxide reduction (nos+) carry a nosrzdfy gene cluster on a 10.1 kb ecori fragment of the nod megaplasmid near the fixghis genes. these nos genes are arranged in three complementation groups and the 10.1 kb ecori fragment is sufficient to confer nos activity to r. meliloti strains lacking such activity. an overlapping hindiii fragment containing the nosrzdfy genes but missing a 0-6 kb hindiii-ecori downstream segment was found incapable of imparting nos activity to strains unable to reduce nitrous oxide, suggesting the presence of other nos gene(s) in this region. tn5 introduced near the hindiii site resulted in mutants with a nos- phenotype. complete sequence analysis of nosy showed that it was well-conserved with respect to that of pseudomonas stutzeri. two previously unreported genes downstream of nosy in r. meliloti were also revealed. contiguous with nosy was a  sequence showing 63% identity with the orfl protein of p. stutzeri. it appeared to be in the same operon as nosdfy and was predicted to encode a membrane lipoprotein similar to the putative nosl of p. stutzeri. unlike the latter protein, however, amino acid sequences typical of metal-binding sites and cysteine residues indicative of the active site of protein disulphide isomerase were absent in the predicted nosl of r. mellioti. the tn5 mutations resulting in  a nos- phenotype were localized within a 966 nucleotide gene 31 nucleotides downstream of nosdfyl with the same orientation. the new gene, nosx, was determined to be in a separate complementation group. it encoded a periplasmic protein with homology in the c-terminal domain with rnff of rhodobacter capsulatus and with a hypothetical escherichia coli protein, yojk. it was concluded that there are seven genes constituting the nos cluster in r. meliloti. they are organized in four complementation groups and in the same orientation, spanning a distance of about 9 kb on the nod megaplasmid.

AB  == in rhodobacter capsulatus (rbc), the participation of dnak in the synthesis of light harvesting antenna complex i (lhi) has been recently inferred from the finding that the amount of lhi alpha- and beta-polypeptides synthesized in an in  vitro translation system was strongly reduced when dnak was depleted. in the present work, a dnak protein was isolated from rbc and biochemically characterized. the n-terminus of the protein was sequenced and a corresponding oligo was used as probe in order to clone the gene coding for dnak. the dnak gene was located in an operon (dnakj) with two open reading frames, which code for dnak and dnaj, respectively. a promoter element corresponding to the consensus sequence of the atypical heat shock (hs) promoter of several alpha-purple proteobacteria was identified. northern blot analysis indicated that dnak and dnaj belong to the same transcriptional unit; there were two transcripts, one comprising both the dnak and dnaj genes and a second with only dnak. primer extension analysis revealed that under both chemotrophic and phototrophic conditions transcription was initiated from the same position before and after hs. the promoter activity was studied under different growth conditions with a dnak-lacz fusion under the control of the dnakj promoter. the present work opens  up the possibility to study the specific role of dnak in the assembly of photosynthetic apparatus proteins.

TI  == comparative characterization of seca from the alpha-subclass purple bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus and escherichia coli reveals differences in membrane and precursor specificity.
AB  == we have cloned the seca gene of the alpha-subclass purple bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus, a close relative to the mitochondrial ancestor, and purified the protein after expression in escherichia coli. r. capsulatus seca contains 904 amino acids with 53% identity to e. coli and 54% identity to caulobacter crescentus seca. in contrast to the nearly equal partitioning of e. coli seca between the cytosol and plasma membrane, r. capsulatus seca is recovered predominantly from the membrane fraction. a seca-deficient, cell-free synthesis-translocation system prepared from r. capsulatus is used to demonstrate translocation activity of the purified r. capsulatus seca. this translocation activity is then compared to that of the e. coli counterpart by using various precursor proteins and inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from both bacteria.  we find a preference of the r. capsulatus seca for the homologous membrane vesicles whereas e. coli seca is active with either type of membrane. furthermore, the two seca proteins clearly select between distinct precursor proteins. in addition, we show here for the first time that a bacterial c-type cytochrome utilizes the canonical, sec-dependent export pathway.

TI  == membrane localization, topology, and mutual stabilization of the rnfabc gene products in rhodobacter capsulatus and implications for a new family of energy-coupling nadh oxidoreductases.
AB  == the rnf genes in rhodobacter capsulatus are unique nitrogen fixation genes that encode potential membrane proteins (rnfa, rnfd, and rnfe) and potential iron-sulfur proteins (rnfb and rnfc). in this study, we first analyzed the localization and topology of the rnfa, rnfb, and rnfc proteins. by activity and immunoblot analysis of expression of translational fusions to escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, rnfa protein was shown to span the chromatophore membrane with its odd-numbered hydrophilic regions exposed to periplasm. by alkaline treatment of membrane fractions and following immunoblot analysis using antibodies against recombinant proteins expressed in e. coli, both rnfb and rnfc  proteins were revealed to situate at the periphery of the chromatophore membranes. second, mutual interaction of the rnf proteins was analyzed by immunochemical determinations of rnfb and rnfc proteins in rnf mutants and their  complemented derivatives. the contents in cellular fractions indicated that rnfb  and rnfc stabilize each other and that the presence of rnfa is necessary for stable existence of both proteins. these results support a hypothesis that the rnf products are subunits of a membrane complex. finally, we detected homologs of rnf genes in haemophilus influenzae and vibrio alginolyticus by data base searches and in e. coli by cloning of a fragment of an rnfa homolog followed by a data base search. close comparisons revealed that rnfc has potential binding sites for nadh and fmn which are similar to those found in proton-translocating nadh:quinone oxidoreductases and that rnfa, rnfd, and rnfe show similarity to subunits of sodium-translocating nadh:quinone oxidoreductases. we predict that the putative rnf complex represents a novel family of energy-coupling nadh oxidoreductases.

AB  == the membrane assembly of outer membrane proteins is more complex than that of transmembrane helical proteins owing to the intervention of many charged and polar residues in the membrane. accordingly, the predictive accuracy of transmembrane beta strands is considerably lower than that of transmembrane alpha helices. in this paper we develop a set of conformational parameters for membrane spanning beta strands. we formulate an algorithm to predict the transmembrane beta strands in the family of bacterial porins based on the conformational parameters and surrounding hydrophobicities of amino acid residues. a fortran program has been developed which takes the amino acid sequence as the input file  and gives the predicted transmembrane beta strand as output. the present method predicts at an accuracy level of 82% for all the bacterial porins considered.

TI  == identification and characterization of the nifv-nifz-nift gene region from the filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena sp. strain pcc 7120.
AB  == the nifv and leua genes, which encode homocitrate synthase and alpha-isopropylmalate synthase, respectively, were cloned from the filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena sp. strain pcc 7120 by a pcr-based strategy. since the n-terminal parts of nifv and leua from other bacteria are highly similar to each  other, a single pair of pcr primers was used to amplify internal fragments of both anabaena strain 7120 genes. sequence analysis of cloned pcr products confirmed the presence of two different nifv-like dna fragments, which were subsequently used as nifv- and leua-specific probes, respectively, to clone xbai  fragments of 2.1 kbp (post4) and 2.6 kbp (post2). plasmid post4 carried the anabaena strain 7120 nifv-nifz-nift genes, whereas post2 contained the leua and dapf genes. the nifvzt genes were not located in close proximity to the main nif  gene cluster in anabaena strain 7120, and therefore nifvzt forms a second nif gene cluster in this strain. overlaps between the nifv and nifz genes and between the nifz and nift genes and the presence of a 1.8-kb transcript indicated that nifvzt might form one transcriptional unit. transcripts of nifv were induced not  only in a nitrogen-depleted culture but also by iron depletion irrespective of the nitrogen status. the nifv gene in anabaena strain 7120 was interrupted by an  interposon insertion (mutant strain bmb105) and by a plasmid integration via a single crossover with a nifv internal fragment as a site for recombination (mutant strain bmb106). both mutant strains were capable of diazotrophic growth,  and their growth rates were only slightly impaired compared to that of the wild type. heterologous complementation of the rhodobacter capsulatus nifv mutant r229i by the anabaena strain 7120 nifv gene corroborated the assumption that anabaena strain 7120 nifv also encodes a homocitrate synthase. in contrast, the anabaena strain 7120 leua gene did not complement the nifv mutation of r229i efficiently.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and expressing the carotenoid biosynthesis genes, lycopene cyclase and phytoene desaturase, from the aerobic photosynthetic bacterium erythrobacter longus sp. strain och101 in escherichia coli.
AB  == two genes which encode the enzymes lycopene cyclase and phytoene desaturase in the aerobic photosynthetic bacterium erythrobacter longus sp. strain och101 have  been cloned and sequenced. the gene for lycopene cyclase, designated crty, was expressed in a strain of escherichia coli which contained the crte, b, i and z genes encoding geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase, phytoene synthase, phytoene desaturase, and beta-carotene hydroxylase, respectively. as a result, zeaxanthin  production was observed in e. coli transformants. in addition, expression of the  e. longus gene crti for phytoene desaturase in e. coli containing crte and b resulted in the accumulation of lycopene in transformants. zeaxanthin and lycopene were also determined by mass spectrum. nucleotide sequence similarities  between e. longus crty gene and other microbial lycopene cyclase genes are 40.2%  (erwinia herbicola), 37.4% (erwinia uredovora) and 22.9% (synechococcus sp.), and those between phytoene desaturase genes are 50.3% (e. herbicola), 54.7% (e. uredovora) and 39.6% (rhodobacter capsulatus).

AB  == a sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase (sqr, ec 1.8.5.'.) has been purified to homogeneity from chromatophores of the non-sulfur purple bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus dsm 155. it is composed of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of about 55 kda, exhibiting absorption and fluorescence spectra typical for a flavoprotein and similar to the sqr from the cyanobacterium oscillatoria limnetica. from n-terminal and tryptic peptide sequences of the pure protein a genomic dna clone was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification. its sequence contains an open reading frame of 1275 base pairs (embl nucleotide sequence data base, accession no. x97478x97478) encoding the sqr of r. capsulatus. the deduced polypeptide consists of 425 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 47 kda and a net charge of +9. the high similarity (72%)/identity (48%) between the n termini of the cyanobacterial and the bacterial enzyme was confirmed and extended. both enzymes exhibit the fad/nad(p)  binding betaalphabeta-fold (wierenga, r. k., terpstra, p., and hol, w. g. s. (1986) j. mol. biol. 187, 101-107). the complete sequence of the sqr from r. capsulatus shows further similarity to flavoproteins, in particular glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase. the cloned sqr was expressed in escherichia coli in a functional form.

TI  == isolation, cloning, sequence analysis and x-ray structure of dimethyl sulfoxide/trimethylamine n-oxide reductase from rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the periplasmic enzyme dimethyl sulfoxide/trimethylamine n-oxide reductase (dmsor/tmaor) from the photosynthetic purple bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus functions as the terminal electron acceptor in its respiratory chain. the enzyme  catalyzes the reduction of highly oxidized substrates like dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) or trimethylamine n-oxide (tmao). at a molybdenum redox centre, two single electrons are transferred from cytochrome c556 to the substrate, e.g. dmso, generating dimethyl sulfide (dms) and water. the operon encoding this enzyme was  isolated, cloned and sequenced, and its chromosomal location determined. it was shown by analytical and crystallographic data that dmsor and tmaor are identical  enzymes. degenerate primers were derived from short peptide sequences and a 700 bp fragment was amplified by nested pcr, subsequently cloned and radioactively labeled to screen a prepared lambda dash library. positive lambda clones were subcloned into pbluescript and subsequently transformed into escherichia coli to  sequence the dmsor/tmaor operon. by an optimized protein purification high yields (5 mg protein/l culture) with a specific activity of 30 u/mg were obtained. the molecular mass was experimentally determined by electrospray mass spectroscopy (ms) to be 85034 da and from the deduced amino acid sequence of the apoenzyme to  be 85033 da. the enzyme was crystallized in space group p4(1)2(1)2 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 80.7 a and c = 229.2 a diffracting beyond 1.8 a. the three-dimensional structure was solved by a combination of multiple isomorphous replacement (mir) and molecular replacement techniques. the atomic model was refined to an r-factor of 0.169 for 57394 independent reflections. the spherical  protein consists of four domains with a funnel-like cavity that leads to the freely accessible metal-ion redox center. the sole bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)molybdenum cofactor (1541 da) of the single chain protein has the molybdenum ion bound to the cis-dithiolene group of only one molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (mgd) molecule. in addition, two oxo ligands and the oxygen  of a serine side chain are bound to the molybdenum ion.

TI  == purification and in vitro phosphorylation of hupt, a regulatory protein controlling hydrogenase gene expression in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the hupt protein of rhodobacter capsulatus, involved in negative regulation of hydrogenase gene expression, is predicted to be a histidine kinase on the basis of sequence comparisons. the protein was overproduced in escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and demonstrated to autophosphorylate in vitro in the presence of [gamma-32p]atp. an h217n hupt mutant was constructed, and the mutant  protein was shown to have lost kinase activity. this result, and the fact that the phosphoryl group in phosphorylated hupt appeared to be bound to an n atom, support the suggestion from sequence comparisons that hupt is a histidine kinase, which can autophosphorylate on the his217 residue.

TI  == use of heme reporters for studies of cytochrome biosynthesis and heme transport.
AB  == strains of escherichia coli containing mutations in the cyddc genes are defective for synthesis of the heme proteins cytochrome bd and c-type cytochromes. the cyddc genes encode a putative heterodimeric atp-binding cassette transporter that has been proposed to act as an exporter of heme to the periplasm. to more fully understand the role of this transporter (and other factors) in heme protein biosynthesis, we developed plasmids that produce various heme proteins (e.g., cytochrome b5, cytochrome b562, and hemoglobin) in the periplasm of e. coli. by using these reporters, it was shown that the steady-state levels of polypeptides  of heme proteins known to be stable without heme (e.g., cytochrome b5 and hemoglobin apoprotein) are significantly reduced in a cydc mutant. exogenous addition of hemin to the cydc mutant still resulted in < 10% of wild-type steady-state levels of apohemoglobin in the periplasm. since the results of heme  reporter studies are not consistent with lower heme availability (i.e., heme export) in a cydc mutant, we analyzed other properties of the periplasm in cydc mutants and compared them with those of the periplasm in cydab (encoding cytochrome bd) mutants and wild-type cells. our results led us to favor a hypothesis whereby cyddc mutants are defective in the reduction environment within the periplasmic space. such an imbalance could lead to defects in the synthesis of heme-liganded proteins. the heme reporters were also used to analyze strains of e. coli with a defect in genes encoding homologs of a different abc transporter (helabc). the helabc genes have previously been shown to be required  for the assembly of c-type cytochromes in rhodobacter capsulatus (r. g. kranz, j. bacteriol. 171:456-464, 1989; d. l. beckman, d. r. trawick, and r. g. kranz, genes dev. 6:268-283, 1992). this locus was shown to be essential in e. coli for  endogenous cytochrome c biogenesis but not cytochrome b562 synthesis. consistent  with these and previous results, it is proposed that the helabc transporter is specifically involved in heme export for ligation (hel). this class of periplasmic cytochromes is proposed to require heme liganding before undergoing correct folding.

AB  == the operon encoding the periplasmic enzymes dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (dmsor)  and trimethylamine n-oxide reductase (tmaor) from the purple, non-sulfur, photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus was isolated, cloned and sequenced, and its chromosomal location determined. it was shown by analytical and crystallographic data that dmsor and tmaor are identical enzymes. degenerate  primers were derived from short peptide sequences generated by automated edman degradation and a 700 bp fragment was amplified by nested pcr, subsequently cloned and radioactively labeled to screen a prepared lambda dash library. positive lambda clones were subcloned into pbluescript and subsequently transformed into escherichia coli to sequence the dmsor/ tmaor operon. the promoter consisted of an a + t-rich region followed by a -35 region, a putative ribosome binding site, and a leader sequence of 13 amino acid residues. the transcription terminator was a g + c-rich dyad sequence capable of forming a hairpin structure, which may act rho-independently. an optimized protein purification of the wild-type enzyme is also described, giving high yields (5 mg  protein per liter of culture) and a specific activity of 30 units/mg. the molecular mass was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry to be 85,034 da;  from the deduced amino acid sequence the molecular mass of the apoenzyme was 85,033 da.

AB  == the heat-shock protein cpn60 (chaperonin, groel homologue) from the phototrophic  bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus b10 was purified to homogeneity and biochemically characterized. native cpn60 from r. capsulatus was shown to be a tetradecamer of 840 kda similar to that of homologous chaperones characterized so far. cpn60 possesses atpase activity and promotes refolding of chaotropically denatured citrate synthase. the groesl operon of r. capsulatus was cloned using a degenerate oligonucleotide and sequenced. two open reading frames (285 and 1,635  bp) were found; they encode cpn10 and cpn60, with corresponding deduced molecular masses of 10.6 and 57.6 kda. the deduced amino acid sequences coincided perfectly with those of the amino terminus and of three tryptic peptides of purified cpn60  from r. capsulatus. strong evidence that r. capsulatus encodes only one copy of the groesl operon was obtained. primer-extension analysis revealed that the groesl operon is transcribed by a -35/-10-type promoter, and that transcription was initiated from the same positions before and after heat-shock under both chemotrophic and phototrophic conditions. the major initiation site is immediately followed by the inverted repeat structure circe, which has been found upstream of many bacterial heat-shock operons. a second minor transcript starts just after the circe element. although heat-shock induction of a groel-lacz fusion failed because of thermal inactivation of the fusion protein, western blot analysis revealed a two- to threefold induction of cellular cpn60 levels 45-75 min after shifting from 28 degrees c to 39 degrees c. deletion mapping of the groesl promoter identified upstream of the promoter a 19-bp element that enhances groesl transcription eightfold and contains the at-rich sequence daaattttt, which is found at similar positions in heat-shock operons of other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == dccd-sensitive proton permeability of bacterial photosynthetic membranes. cross-reconstitution studies with purified bovine heart fo subunits.
AB  == the dccd-sensitive proton permeability of chromatophores, from a green strain of  rhodobacter capsulatus is potentiometrically detected following the proton release induced by a transmembrane diffusion potential imposed by a valinomycin-mediated potassium influx with a procedure already used for bovine heart submitochondrial particles (esmp) and vesicles from escherichia coli (zanotti et al. (1994) eur. j. biochem. 222, 733-741). in the photosynthetic system, addition of increasing amounts of dccd inhibits, with a similar titre, both proton permeability and mgatp-dependent atpase activity as detected in the dark. the titre for 50% inhibition coincides with that obtained measuring proton  permeability and atp hydrolysis in esmp. upon removal of f1, the passive proton permeability is much less sensitive to dccd in chromatophores than in usmp, suggesting that in chromatophores the f1-fo interaction shapes the dccd-sensitive proton conducting pathway. addition of the purified mitochondrial foi-pvp and oligomycin sensitivity-conferring (oscp) proteins to the f1 stripped chromatophores restored the sensitivity of proton permeability to dccd detected in untreated chromatophores. analysis of the binding of 14c[dccd] on f1 stripped  chromatophores shows that the increase of dccd sensitivity of proton permeability, caused by addition of mitochondrial fo proteins, is related to an increase of the binding of the inhibitor to subunit c of fo sector of atp synthase complex.

TI  == purification and activities of the rhodobacter capsulatus rpon (sigma n) protein.
AB  == the rpon-encoded sigma factors (sigma n) are a distinct class of bacterial sigma  factors, with no obvious homology to the major sigma 70 class. the sigma n-containing rna polymerase holoenzyme functions in enhancer-dependent transcription to allow expression of positively controlled genes. we have purified the rhodobacter capsulatus sigma n protein, which is distinctive in lacking an acidic region implicated in the melting of promoter dna by the escherichia coll sigma n holoenzyme, and may represent a minor subclass of sigma  n proteins. assays of promoter recognition and holoenzyme formation and function  showed that the purified r. capsulatus sigma n protein is distinct in activity compared to the enteric proteins, but retains the broad functions described for these proteins. as first described for the klebsiella pneumoniae protein, promoter recognition in the absence of core rna polymerase was detected, but contact of certain promoter bases by the r. capsulatus sigma n protein and its response to core rna polymerase was clearly different from that determined for the k. pneumoniae and e. coli proteins. results are discussed in the context of a requirement to modulate the activity of the dna-binding surfaces of sigma n to regulate sigma n function. circular dichroism was used to evaluate the structure  of the r. capsulatus protein and revealed differences in the tertiary signals as  compared to the k. pneumoniae protein, some of which are attributable to the dna-binding domain of sigma n.

TI  == effect of the pufq-pufb intercistronic region on puf mrna stability in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == differential expression of genes localized within the polycistronic puf operon of rhodobacter capsulatus is partly due to altered stabilities of individual mrna segments. we show that the 5' untranslated region (utr) of pufb contributes to the unusual longevity of the 0.5 kb light-harvesting (lh) i specific pufba mrna and of the 2.7 kb pufbalmx mrna. three stem-loop structures have been identified  within the pufq-pufb intercistronic region by means of rna secondary-structure analysis in vitro and in vivo. deletion analysis of the pufb 5' utr indicates that the complete set of secondary structures is required to maintain wild-type levels of pufba mrna stability. a phylogenetic comparison of pufb 5' utrs of other photosynthetic bacteria reveals an evolutionary conservation of the base-pairing potential despite sequence divergence. comparison of puf mrna decay  in escherichia coli strains with or without endoribonuclease e (rnase e) activity suggests that the pufb 5' secondary structures protect the downstream mrna segment against degradation by rnase e. removal of the 117-nucleotide pufq-pufb intercistronic region results in loss of stability for the pufba and pufbalmx mrnas with concomitant stabilization of the full-length puf primary transcript (qbalmx). we therefore conclude that the deleted sequence functions both as a stabilizing element for pufbalmx and pufba segments and as a target site for initial rate-limiting decay of the unstable pufqbalmx mrna.

TI  == identification of residues of rhodobacter capsulatus ferredoxin i important for its interaction with nitrogenase.
AB  == in rhodobacter capsulatus, ferredoxin i (fdi) serves as natural electron donor to nitrogenase. in order to probe amino acid residues possibly involved in the interaction with dinitrogenase reductase, fdi was subjected to site-specific mutagenesis. a three-dimensional structure of fdi was designed by computer modelling and used for selecting target residues. mutant ferredoxins bearing substitutions of surface residues, as well as a variant having a met2 --> tyr replacement in the vicinity of one cluster, have been constructed. all fdi variants were expressed to similar levels both in escherichia coli and in a fdi-deleted mutant of the natural host. once purified, the mutant ferredoxins exhibited molecular and spectroscopic properties almost identical to wild-type fdi. determination of the reduction potential of fdi by cyclic voltammetry gave an e'o of -510 mv (ph 7.6) for both clusters, which is one of the lowest values reported for a 2[4fe-4s] ferredoxin. only the [tyr2]fdi variant showed a significant difference in redox potential (delta e'o = -15 mv). based on in vitro assays, a [glu27, glu28]fdi double mutant exhibited a twofold decrease in the electron transfer rate to dinitrogenase reductase while the affinity of this mutant for the enzyme was barely affected. on the other hand, an asp36 --> his substitution resulted in a sevenfold increase of the apparent km for dinitrogenase reductase. unlike fdi and the other mutant ferredoxins, the [his36]fdi variant also failed to form a cross-linked complex with dinitrogenase  reductase upon incubation with a carbodiimide. it is concluded that asp36 in fdi  probably participates in the interaction between the two protein partners. nevertheless, all the fdi mutants proved competent in restoring a wild-type phenotype when expressed in a fdi-deleted mutant background, indicating that none of the studied residues was absolutely critical for electron transfer to nitrogenase.

(1994) j. bacteriol., 176, 1121-1127]. taking advantage of the fragmentation deficient mutant strain fm65, we used genetic complementation to find the mutated gene responsible for this aberration. it was identified as the rhodobacter homologue to mc from escherichia coli encoding endoribonuclease iii (rnase iii). the predicted protein has 226 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25.5 kda. it shares high homology with other known rnase iii enzymes over the full length. in particular it shows the double-stranded rna-binding domain (dsrbd) motif essential for binding of dsrna substrates. the fm65 mutant has a frame shift mutation resulting in complete loss of the dsrbd rendering the enzyme inactive. the cloned rhodobacter enzyme can substitute rnase iii activity in an rnase iii deficient e. coli strain. contrary to e. coli, the rhodobacter mc is in one operon together with the lep gene encoding the leader peptidase.

TI  == in vitro reconstitution and characterization of the rhodobacter capsulatus ntrb and ntrc two-component system.
AB  == enhancer-dependent transcription in enteric bacteria depends upon an activator protein that binds dna far upstream from the promoter and an alternative sigma factor (sigma 54) that binds with the core rna polymerase at the promoter. in the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus, the ntrb and ntrc proteins (rcntrb and rcntrc) are putative members of a two-component system that is novel  because the enhancer-binding rcntrc protein activates transcription of sigma 54-independent promoters. to reconstitute this putative two-component system in vitro, the rentrb protein was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified as a maltose-binding protein fusion (mbp-rcntrb). mbp-rcntrb autophosphorylates in vitro to the same steady state level and with the same stability as the salmonella typhimurium ntrb (stntrb) protein but at a lower initial rate. mbp-rcntrb autophosphorylates the s.typhimurium ntrc (st-ntrc) and rcntrc proteins in vitro. the enteric ntrc protein is also phosphorylated in vivo by rcntrb because plasmids that encode either rcntrb or mbp-rc-ntrb activate transcription of an ntrc-dependent nifl-lacz fusion. the rate of phosphotransfer  to rcntrc and autophosphatase activity of phosphorylated rcntrc (rcntrc---p) are  comparable to the stntrc protein. however, the rcntrc protein appears to be a specific rcntrb p phosphatase since rcntrc is not phosphorylated by small molecular weight phosphate compounds or by the stntrb protein. rcntrc forms a dimer in solution, and rcntrc - p binds the upstream tandem binding sites of the  g1nb promoter 4-fold better than the unphos-phorylated rcntrc protein, presumably due to oligomerization of rcntrc -p. therefore, the r. capsulatus ntrb and ntrc proteins form a two-component system similar to other ntrc-like systems, where specific rc- ntrb phosphotransfer to the rcntrc protein results in increased oligoinerization at the enhancer but with subsequent activation of a sigma 54-independent promoter.

AB  == the modabc gene products constitute the molybdate-specific transport system in escherichia coli. another operon coding for two proteins which diverges from the  modabcd operon has been identified. the first gene of this operon codes for a 262-amino-acid protein, designated mode (28 kda), and the second genes codes for  a 490-amino-acid protein. modf (54 kda). the role of modf has not yet been determined; however, mutations in mode depressed modabcd transcription even in the presence of molybdate, suggesting that mode is a repressor. mode, in the presence of 1 mm molybdate, repressed the production of plasmid-encoded moda and  modb' proteins in an in vitro transcription-translation system. dna mobility shift experiments confirmed that mode binds to an oligonucleotide derived from the operator region of the modabcd operon. further experimentation indicated that mode binding to target dna minimally requires an 8-bp inverted-repeat sequence, taac gita. a highly conserved amino acid sequence, tsarnoxxg (amino acids 125 to  133), was identified in mode and homologs from azotobacter vinelandii, haemophilus influenzae, rhodobacter capsulatus, and clostridium pasterianum. mutants with mutations in either t or g of this amino acid sequence were isolated as "superrepressor" mutants. these mutant proteins repressed modabcd transcription even in the absence of molybdate, which implies that this stretch of amino acids is essential for the binding of molybdate by the mode protein. these results show that molybdate transport in e. coli is regulated by mode, which acts as a repressor when bound to molybdate.

TI  == open reading frame 176 in the photosynthesis gene cluster of rhodobacter capsulatus encodes idi, a gene for isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase.
AB  == isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) isomerase catalyzes an essential activation step in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. a database search based on probes from the highly conserved regions in three eukaryotic ipp isomerases revealed substantial  similarity with orf176 in the photosynthesis gene cluster in rhodobacter capsulatus. the open reading frame was cloned into an escherichia coli expression vector. the encoded 20-kda protein, which was purified in two steps by ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, catalyzed the interconversion of ipp and dimethylallyl diphosphate. thus, the photosynthesis gene cluster encodes all of the enzymes required to incorporate ipp into the ultimate carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll metabolites in r. capsulatus. more recent searches uncovered additional putative open reading frames for ipp isomerase in seed-bearing plants (oryza sativa, arabidopsis thaliana, and clarkia breweri), a worm (caenorhabditis elegans), and another eubacterium (escherichia coli). the r. capsulatus enzyme is the smallest of the ipp isomerases to be identified thus far and may consist mostly of a fundamental catalytic core for the enzyme.

TI  == expression of the cbblcbbs and cbbm genes and distinct organization of the cbb calvin cycle structural genes of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus fixes co2 via the calvin reductive pentose phosphate pathway and, like some other nonsulfur purple bacteria, is known to synthesize two distinct structural forms of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase  (rubisco). cosmid clones that hybridized to form i (cbblcbbs) and form ii (cbbm)  rubisco gene probes were isolated from a genomic library of r. capsulatus strain  sb1003. southern blotting and hybridization analysis with gene-specific probes derived from rhodobacter sphaeroides revealed that r. capsulatus cbbm is clustered with genes encoding other enzymes of the calvin cycle, including fructose 1,6/sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase (cbbf), phosphoribulokinase (cbbp), transketolase (cbbt), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cbbg), and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (cbba), as well as a gene (cbbr) encoding a divergently transcribed lysr-type regulatory protein. surprisingly, a cosmid clone containing the r. capsulatus form i rubisco genes (cbbl and cbbs) failed to hybridize to the other cbb structural gene probes, unlike the situation with the  closely related organism r. sphaeroides. the form i and form ii rubisco genes were cloned into puc-derived vectors and were expressed in escherichia coli to yield active recombinant enzyme in each case. complementation of a rubisco-deletion strain of r. sphaeroides to photosynthetic growth by r. capsulatus cbblcbbs or cbbm was achieved using the broad host-range vector, prk415, and r. sphaeroides expression vector prps-1.

TI  == cloning and overexpression of the rhodobacter capsulatus hemh gene.
AB  == in photosynthetically grown rhodobacter capsulatus, heme is a qualitatively minor end product of the common tetrapyrrole pathway, but it may play a significant regulatory role. heme is synthesized from protoporphyrin by the product of the hemh gene, ferrochelatase. we have cloned the r. capsulatus hemh gene by complementation of an escherichia coli hemh mutant. when a plasmid carrying the hemh gene is returned to r. capsulatus, ferrochelatase activity increases, aminolevulinate synthase activity decreases, and bacteriochlorophyll levels are dramatically lowered. this is the first in vivo evidence to suggest that heme feedback inhibits aminolevulinate synthase in r. capsulatus, thereby reducing porphyrin synthesis.

TI  == expression of the puta gene encoding proline dehydrogenase from rhodobacter capsulatus is independent of ntrc regulation but requires an lrp-like activator protein.
AB  == four rhodobacter capsulatus mutants unable to grow with proline as the sole nitrogen source were isolated by random tn5 mutagenesis. the tn5 insertions were  mapped within two adjacent chromosomal ecori fragments. dna sequence analysis of  this region revealed three open reading frames designated seld, putr, and puta. the puta gene codes for a protein of 1,127 amino acid residues which is homologous to puta of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli. the central part of r. capsulatus puta showed homology to proline dehydrogenase of saccharomyces cerevisiae (put1) and drosophila melanogaster (slga). the c-terminal part of puta exhibited homology to put2 (pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase) of s. cerevisiae and to aldehyde dehydrogenases from different organisms. therefore, it seems likely that in r. capsulatus, as in enteric bacteria, both enzymatic steps for proline degradation are catalyzed by a single  polypeptide (puta). the deduced amino acid sequence of putr (154 amino acid residues) showed homology to the small regulatory proteins lrp, bkdr, and asnc. the putr gene, which is divergently transcribed from puta, is essential for proline utilization and codes for an activator of puta expression. the expression of puta was induced by proline and was not affected by ammonia or other amino acids. in addition, puta expression was autoregulated by puta itself. mutations in glnb, nifr1 (ntrc), and nifr4 (ntra encoding sigma 54) had no influence on put gene expression. the open reading frame located downstream of r. capsulatus putr  exhibited strong homology to the e. coli seld gene, which is involved in selenium metabolism. r. capsulatus seld mutants exhibited a put+ phenotype, demonstrating  that seld is required neither for viability nor for proline utilization.

TI  == characterization of the cychjkl genes involved in cytochrome c biogenesis and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in rhizobium leguminosarum.
AB  == mutants of rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae unable to respire via the cytochrome aa3 pathway were identified by the inability to oxidize n,n'-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine. two mutants which were complemented by cosmid pij1942 from an r. leguminosarum clone bank were identified. although pea nodules induced by these mutants contained many bacteroids, no symbiotic nitrogen fixation was detected. heme staining of cellular proteins revealed that all cytochrome c-type heme proteins were absent. these mutants lacked spectroscopically detectable cytochrome c, but cytochromes aa3 and d were present, the latter at a higher-than-normal level. dna sequence analysis of complementing plasmids revealed four apparently cotranscribed open reading frames (cych, cycj, cyck, and cycl). cych, cycj, cyck, and cycl are homologous to bradyrhizobium japonicum and rhizobium meliloti proteins thought to be involved in the attachment of heme to cytochrome c apoproteins; cyck and cycl are also homologous to the rhodobacter capsulatus ccl1 and ccl2 gene products and the escherichia coli nrfe and nrff gene products involved in the assembly of c-type cytochromes. the absence of cytochrome c heme proteins in these r. leguminosarum  mutants is consistent with the view that the cychjkl operon could be involved in  the attachment of heme to apocytochrome c.

AB  == the fdxn gene from rhizobium meliloti encoding a bacterial-type ferredoxin (fdxn) was expressed in escherichia coli under the control of the lac promoter. the fdxn gene product was purified under anaerobic conditions by ion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration steps using an antiserum raised against an fdxn-lacz fusion protein as a detection system. the purified ferredoxin was shown to be identical to the predicted r. meliloti fdxn protein in its amino acid composition and n-terminal amino acid sequence. chemical determination of the iron content revealed 8.6 +/- 0.6 mol fe/mol fdxn. the ultraviolet/visible absorption spectrum of the fdxn protein in the oxidized form exhibited maxima at  284 nm and 378 nm, with an a378/a284 ratio of 0.7. epr spectroscopy revealed a rhombic signal when fdxn was partially reduced, and a broad signal indicative of  spin-spin interaction when fully reduced, suggesting the presence of two fe-s cluster/ferredoxin polypeptide. our data suggest that fdxn contains two [4fe-4s]  clusters. purified fdxn was able to mediate electron transport between illuminated chloroplasts and rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogenase in vitro.

TI  == characterization of a 2[4fe-4s] ferredoxin obtained by chemical insertion of the  fe-s clusters into the apoferredoxin ii from rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the rhodobacter capsulatus ferredoxin ii (fdii) belongs to a family of 7fe ferredoxins containing one [3fe-4s] cluster and one [4fe-4s] cluster. this protein, encoded by the fdxa gene, has been overproduced in escherichia coli as a soluble apoferredoxin. the purified recombinant protein was subjected to reconstitution experiments by chemical incorporation of the fe-s clusters under anaerobic conditions. a brown protein was obtained, the formation of which was dependent upon the complete unfolding of the polypeptide prior to incorporation of iron and sulfur atoms. the yield of the reconstituted product was higher when  the reaction was carried out at slightly basic ph. the reconstituted ferredoxin was purified and shown to be distinct from the native [7fe-8s] ferredoxin, based  on several biochemical and spectroscopic criteria. in the oxidized state, epr revealed the quasi-absence of [3fe-4s] cluster. 1h-nmr spectroscopic analyses provided evidence that the protein was reconstituted as a 2[4fe-4s] ferredoxin. this conclusion was further supported by the determination by electrospray mass spectrometry of the molecular mass of the reconstituted protein, which matched within 2 da to the mass of the fdii polypeptide incremented of eight atoms each of iron and sulfur. exposure of the reconstituted protein to air resulted in a fast and irreversible oxidative denaturation of the fe-s clusters, without formation of [7fe-8s] form. unlike the natural 7fe ferredoxin, the reconstituted  ferredoxin appeared incompetent in an electron-transfer assay coupled to nitrogenase activity. the fact that the apofdii was reconstituted as a highly unstable 8fe ferredoxin instead of the 7fe naturally occurring fdii is discussed  in relation to the results obtained with other types of ferredoxins.

TI  == a homolog of the rhizobium meliloti nitrogen fixation gene fixn is involved in the production of a microaerobically induced oxidase activity in the phytopathogenic bacterium agrobacterium tumefaciens.
AB  == hybridization analysis using the rhizobium meliloti nitrogen fixation gene fixn as a probe revealed the presence of a homologous dna region in the phytopathogenic bacterium agrobacterium tumefaciens. hybridization signals were also detected with total dnas of rhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli, rhodobacter capsulatus and escherichia coli, but not those of xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and pseudomonas putida. the hybridizing fragment from a. tumefaciens was cloned and sequenced. the predicted gene product of one of the two open reading frames identified on the sequenced fragment shows homology to fixn of different rhizobiaceae as well as a low but significant similarity to subunit i of heme copper oxidases from various bacteria. the presence of five strictly conserved histidine residues previously implicated in forming ligands to heme and cub in oxidases and the predicted membrane topology provide evidence that the a. tumefaciens fixn-like gene product is a component of the heme copper  oxidase superfamily. the incomplete open reading frame starting only 8 nucleotides downstream of the fixn-like gene exhibits homology to rhizobium fixo. using an uida (gus) gene fusion it could be shown that the a. tumefaciens fixn-like gene is preferentially expressed under microaerobic conditions. expression of the uida fusion is abolished in r. meliloti fixj and fixk mutants,  indicating that an fnr-like protein is involved in transcriptional regulation of  the fixn-like gene in a. tumefaciens. the presence of an upstream dna sequence motif identical to the fnr-consensus binding site (anaerobox) further supports this hypothesis. a. tumefaciens mutated in the fixn-like gene shows decreased tmpd-specific oxidase activity under microaerobic conditions, indicating that the fixn-like gene or operon codes for proteins involved in respiration under reduced oxygen availability.

AB  == the carotenoid biosynthesis genes form a cluster within the genome of rhodobacter sphaeroides, lying in the middle of a larger cluster and 45 kb in length, which contains genes for bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis and for the reaction center and light-harvesting apoproteins. the positions and approximate limits of the carotenoid genes were determined previously by localized transposon tn5 mutagenesis and by comparison with the closely related rhodobacter capsulatus carotenoid gene cluster. in this report, analysis of the dna and deduced amino acid sequences of the carotenoid genes in r. sphaeroides are presented. twenty-five tn5 insertion mutants were used to produce a base-specific tn5 insertion map of this region, and carotenoid gene assignment was supported by spectroscopic, ultrastructural, and high-pressure liquid chromatography analyses  of these mutants. a region in the 3' end of crtd which affects bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis was discovered, and crta was found to possess a  proline-rich c-terminal region containing a repeated (ala-pro)n motif. crtf also  showed a high degree of sequence conservation with eukaryotic o-methyltransferases. this study provides gene sequences and assignments based upon a comprehensive structural, spectroscopic, and biochemical analysis of a range of carotenoid biosynthetic mutants; in each mutation, the point of tn5 insertion is determined accurate to 1 bp on the gene cluster.

AB  == although considerable homology exists between the translation products of the rpll, rpob and rpoc genes of the beta operons of the gram-negative organism escherichia coli and the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus the region between the rpll and rpob genes is quite different in the two bacterial species. in e. coli the 324 bp has three centres of dyad symmetry in the first half of the sequence and multiple nonsense codons in all three reading frames. by contrast, the corresponding region in s. aureus consists of 1000 bp capable of forming a similar arrangement of stem-loop structures but with an open reading frame, sited 177 bp downstream of the end of rpll and 217 bp upstream of the beginning of the  rpob gene, with consensus initiation and termination signals, which if translated would generate a 22,665 da protein with 202 amino acids. in view of the inability to find any significant homology with other proteins in the data bank and because the evidence suggests, as in e. coli, that the rpll-rpob intergenic sequence is involved in regulation it is proposed that the expression product of orf202 may be a further element of control in the s. aureus beta operon.

TI  == are most transporters and channels beta barrels?
AB  == given the sequence of transporters or channels of unknown secondary structure, it is usual to predict their putative transmembrane regions as alpha-helical. however, recent evidence for a facilitative glucose transporter (glut1) appears inconsistent with such predictions, which has led us to propose an alternative folding model for gluts based on the 16-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel of porins. here we apply the same predictive algorithms we used for gluts to several other membrane proteins. for some of them, a high-resolution structure has been derived (beta-barrels: rhodobacter capsulatus and escherichia coli porins; multihelical: colicin a, bacteriorhodopsin, and reaction center l chain); we use  them to test the prediction procedures. the other proteins we analyze (glut1, chip28, acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit, lac permease, na(+)-glucose cotransporter, shaker k+ channel, sarcoplasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase) are representative of classes of similar membrane proteins. as with gluts, we find that the predicted transmembrane segments of these proteins are consistently shorter than expected for transmembrane spanning alpha-helices, but are of the correct length and number for the proteins to fold instead as porin-like beta-barrels.

AB  == the structure of the membrane channel porin from the phototrophic bacteria rhodopseudomonas blastica has been refined at 1.96 a resolution yielding an r-factor of 17.6%. the final model consists of all 289 amino acid residues, 247 water molecules and three detergent molecules modelled as n-octyltetraoxyethylene. one of these detergent molecules binds together with its two symmetry-related molecules tightly in a pocket at the molecular 3-fold axis.  this pocket may bind three alkyl chains of a lipopolysaccharide which in turn would stabilize the trimer and could possibly play a role in membrane insertion.  the overall shape of this porin resembles ompf of escherichia coli more than the  only known sequence-related porin from rhodobacter capsulatus. the membrane contacting surface is similar in all structurally known porins; it shows exceptional frequencies of amino acid residues and side-chain rotamers. the 46-residue loop beta 5-beta 6 of the porin is shown to be tightly fastened to the beta-barrel, excluding an in vivo loop movement that closes the pore. the trimer  interface region has the structure of a water-soluble protein with an extensive non-polar core and numerous hydrogen bonds at the surface. the loops at the external end of the barrel are long and rigid whereas those at the periplasmic barrel end are short and mobile. the crystal packing is discussed.

TI  == sequences, organization and analysis of the hupzmnoqrtv genes from the azotobacter chroococcum hydrogenase gene cluster.
AB  == hydrogen-uptake (hup) activity in azotobacter chroococcum depends upon a cluster  of genes spread over 13,687 bp of the chromosome. six accessory genes of the cluster, hupabycde, begin 4.8 kb downstream of the structural genes, hupsl, and are required for the formation of a functional [nife] hydrogenase. the sequencing of the intervening 4.8 kb of hup-specific dna has now been completed. this revealed eight additional closely linked orfs, which we designated hupz, hupm, hupn, hupo, hupq, hupr, hupt and hupv. these genes potentially encode polypeptides with predicted masses of 27.7, 22.3, 11.4, 16.2, 31.3, 8.1, 16.2 and 36.7 kda, respectively. all eight genes are transcribed from the same strand as hupsl and hupabycde. a chroococcum, therefore, has a total of 16 contiguous genes affecting hydrogenase activity beginning with hups and ending with hupe. the amino acid sequence deduced from hupz has the characteristics of a b-type cytochrome. insertion mutagenesis of hupz resulted in a mutant incapable of supporting o2-dependent h2 oxidation. the deduced amino acid sequence of hupr shares high homology with bacterial rubredoxins. hupz and hupr may both be involved in transferring electrons from hydrogenase to the electron transport chain. a mutation in hupv knocked out hydrogenase activity entirely; this gene may be involved in processing the large subunit of hydrogenase. it is now clear that the genes controlling [nife] hydrogenase activity in many bacteria including azotobacter chroococcum, alcaligenes eutrophus, rhizobium leguminosarum, rhodobacter capsulatus and escherichia coli are highly conserved, organized in much the same manner, and likely derived from a common ancestor.

TI  == multiple states of the molybdenum centre of dimethylsulphoxide reductase from rhodobacter capsulatus revealed by epr spectroscopy.
AB  == the dimethylsulphoxide reductase of rhodobacter capsulatus contains a pterin molybdenum cofactor molecule as its only prosthetic group. kinetic studies were consistent with re-oxidation of the enzyme being rate limiting in the turnover of dimethylsulphoxide in the presence of the benzyl viologen radical. epr spectra of molybdenum(v) were generated by reducing the highly purified enzyme under a variety of conditions, and with careful control it was possible to generate at least five clearly distinct epr signals. these could be simulated, indicating that each corresponds to a single chemical species. structures of the signal-giving species are discussed in light of the epr parameters and of information from the literature. three of the signals show coupling of molybdenum to an exchangeable proton and, in the corresponding species, the metal is presumed to bear a hydroxyl ligand. one signal with gav 1.96 shows a very strong  similarity to a signal for the desulpho form of xanthine oxidase, while two others with gav values of 1.98 show a distinct similarity to signals from nitrate reductase of escherichia coli. these data indicate an unusual flexibility in the  active site of dimethylsulphoxide reductase, as well as emphasising structural similarities between molybdenum enzymes bearing different forms of the pterin cofactor. interchange among the different species must involve either a change of coordination geometry, a ligand exchange, or both. the latter may involve replacement of an amino acid residue co-ordinating molybdenum via o or n, for a cysteine co-ordinating via s. since the two signals with gav 1.96 were obtained only under specific conditions of reduction of the enzyme by dithionite, it is postulated that their generation may be triggered by reduction of the pteridine of the molybdenum cofactor from a dihydro state to the tetrahydro state.

TI  == heterologous expression of the bchm gene product from rhodobacter capsulatus and  demonstration that it encodes s-adenosyl-l-methionine:mg-protoporphyrin ix methyltransferase.
AB  == the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis gene, bchm, from rhodobacter capsulatus was  previously believed to code for a polypeptide involved in formation of the cyclopentone ring of protochlorophyllide from mg-protoporphyrin ix monomethyl ester. in this study, r. capsulatus bchm was expressed in escherichia coli and the gene product was subsequently demonstrated by enzymatic analysis to catalyze  methylation of mg-protoporphyrin ix to form mg-protoporphyrin ix monomethyl ester. activity required the substrates mg-protoporphyrin ix and s-adenosyl-l-methionine. 14c-labeled product was formed in incubations containing 14c-methyl-labeled s-adenosyl-l-methionine. on the basis of these and previous results, we also conclude that the bchh gene, which was previously reported to code for mg-protoporphyrin ix methyltransferase, is most likely involved in the mg chelation step.

TI  == bacterial genes and proteins involved in the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes and terminal oxidases.
AB  == a total of nine genes potentially concerned with the biosynthesis of c-type cytochromes have been identified recently in the bacteria bradyrhizobium japonicum and rhodobacter capsulatus, and homologous counterparts appear to be present also in escherichia coli. most of the respective gene products are membrane-bound, while others are located in the periplasmic space. as inferred from sequence analyses, several of these proteins may play roles in membrane transport or redox processes, both functions being consistent with the required steps in cytochrome c formation (membrane translocation of heme; covalent linkage of protoheme ix to cysteine thiols). further genes of b. japonicum, e. coli, bacillus subtilis and paracoccus denitrificans have been studied whose products are necessary for the formation of intact heme/copper oxidases. some of them are  probably required in protein folding and assembly whereas others appear to be enzymes catalyzing steps in the biosynthesis of the heme cofactors.

TI  == iron metabolism in rhodobacter capsulatus. characterisation of bacterioferritin and formation of non-haem iron particles in intact cells.
AB  == the water-soluble cytochrome b557 from the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus was purified and shown to have the properties of the iron-storage protein bacterioferritin. the molecular mass of r. capsulatus bacterioferritin is 428 kda and it is composed of a single type of 18-kda subunit. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the bacterioferritin subunit shows 70% identity to the sequence of bacterioferritin subunits from escherichia coli, nitrobacter winogradskyi, azotobacter vinelandii and synechocystis pcc 6803. the absorbance spectrum of reduced bacterioferritin shows absorbance maxima at 557 nm (alpha band), 526 nm (beta band) and 417 nm (soret band) from the six haem groups/molecule. antibody assays reveal that bacterioferritin is located in the cytoplasm of r. capsulatus, and its levels stay relatively constant during batch  growth under aerobic conditions when the iron concentration in the medium is kept constant. iron deficiency leads to a decrease in bacterioferritin and iron overload leads to an increase. bacterioferritin from r. capsulatus has an amorphous iron-oxide core with a high phosphate content (900-1000 fe atoms and approximately 600 phosphates/bacterioferritin molecule). mossbauer spectroscopy indicates that in both aerobically and anaerobically (phototrophically) grown cells bacterioferritin with an fe3+ core is formed, suggesting that iron-core formation in vivo may not always require molecular oxygen.

TI  == characterisation of the porin of rhodobacter capsulatus 37b4 in planar lipid bilayers.
AB  == the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria contains aqueous channels, porins, which aid the diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules across it. escherichia coli, as enteric bacteria, are able to survive a hostile environment of proteases, surfactants, and drastic changes of osmotic pressure. rhodobacter capsulatus is not an enteric bacterium and as such has not evolved to resist the  same challenges. porins, which have molecular weight of approximately 35 kda, form trimeric channels with a solute exclusion limit of about 600 da. most of them open and close in a controlled manner as a function of p.d. this function is little understood at present. the functional properties of single trimers of the  major porin of rhodobacter capsulatus 37b4 have been investigated in planar artificial bilayers. on application of a suitable p.d. the observed trimer closes in approximately three equal steps. the behaviour is completely symmetrical as regards closure in response to p.d.'s of opposite polarity and is strongly cation selective.

TI  == a new gene expression system based on a fructose-dependent promoter from rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == translational lacz fusions were constructed to analyse transcription of the fructose operon, encoding the fructose-specific phosphotransferase system of rhodobacter capsulatus. it was demonstrated that transcription from the fru promoter (frup) was negligible without fructose, and stimulated more than 100-fold by the presence of the inducer. a multiple cloning site, frup, and a cassette conferring gentamycin resistance were assembled to form a cloning cartridge which is easily transferable to a broad-host-range vector. the sequence initiating the first gene of the fru operon was altered to introduce a ndei site, allowing insertion of the 5' end of a gene at the correct distance from the ribosome-binding site. the system has been used to express the escherichia coli lacz gene in r. capsulatus. beta gal activity was shown to be specifically and rapidly induced by fructose, at low concentrations. vectors for fructose-dependent gene expression also proved to be useful in the complementation analysis of mutants. a fdxn mutant of r. capsulatus, markedly impaired in its ability to fix nitrogen due to the lack of a ferredoxin, could be fully complemented using a plasmid carrying a copy of fdxn behind frup. complementation, as well as the synthesis of the ferredoxin, were found to be strictly fructose dependent.

AB  == the essential gene efg, which complements ammonia-dependent growth (adga) mutations in rhodobacter capsulatus and is located at 38.1 min on the escherichia coli chromosome, was found to code for nh3-dependent nad synthetase. crude extracts from a strain which overproduces the efg gene product contained up to 400 times more activity than crude extracts from the control strain, and the purified efg protein possessed-nh3-dependent nad synthetase activity. glutamine-dependent nad synthetase activity was found in crude extracts of e. coli but not in the purified enzyme, suggesting that it may be catalyzed by an additional subunit. an r. capsulatus strain carrying an adga mutation was found to be deficient in nad synthetase activity, and activity was restored by complementation with the e. coli gene. in accordance with the nomenclature proposed for salmonella typhimurium (k. t. hughes, b. m. olivera, and j. r. roth, j. bacteriol. 170:2113-2120, 1988), the efg and adga genes should now be designated nade.

TI  == recombinant expression of the fdxd gene of rhodobacter capsulatus and characterization of its product, a [2fe-2s] ferredoxin.
AB  == a gene called fdxd that could potentially code for a ferredoxin has recently been identified upstream of the nitrogenase structural genes in rhodobacter capsulatus [willison, pierrard and hubner (1993) gene 133, 39-46]. in the present study, the fdxd gene product has been overproduced in escherichia coli in a soluble form. the recombinant protein, pink in colour, was purified to homogeneity, and biochemically characterized as a new ferredoxin. it represents the fifth ferredoxin so far identified in r. capsulatus and was designated fdv. its n-terminal sequence is identical with that of the native ferredoxin isolated from r. capsulatus. u.v-visible-absorption spectra as well as results of c.d. and e.p.r. spectroscopy demonstrated that the fdxd product contained a [2fe-2s] cluster correctly assembled and incorporated into the polypeptide. although similar to plant-type ferredoxins, fdv appeared poorly competent in the photo-reduction of nadp+. on the basis of in vitro assays, fdv cannot serve as an electron donor for nitrogenase. the lack of reactivity of fdv in either of these  assays may primarily be due to its relatively high mid-point redox potential (e'o = -220 mv, ph 7.5).

TI  == sequencing, chromosomal inactivation, and functional expression in escherichia coli of ppsr, a gene which represses carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll synthesis in rhodobacter sphaeroides.
AB  == sequencing of a dna fragment that causes trans suppression of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid levels in rhodobacter sphaeroides revealed two genes: orf-192 and  ppsr. the ppsr gene alone is sufficient for photopigment suppression. inactivation of the r. sphaeroides chromosomal copy of ppsr results in overproduction of both bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid pigments. the deduced 464-amino-acid protein product of ppsr is homologous to the crtj protein of rhodobacter capsulatus and contains a helix-turn-helix domain that is found in various dna-binding proteins. removal of the helix-turn-helix domain renders ppsr nonfunctional. the promoter of ppsr is located within the coding region of the upstream orf-192 gene. when this promoter is replaced by a lacz promoter, ppsr is expressed in escherichia coli. an r. sphaeroides dna fragment carrying crtd', -e, and -f and bchc, -x, -y, and -z' exhibited putative promoter activity in e. coli. this putative promoter activity could be suppressed by ppsr in both e. coli and r. sphaeroides. these results suggest that ppsr is a transcriptional repressor. it could potentially act by binding to a putative regulatory palindrome found in  the 5' flanking regions of a number of r. sphaeroides and r. capsulatus photosynthesis genes.

TI  == a seven-gene operon essential for formate-dependent nitrite reduction to ammonia  by enteric bacteria.
AB  == the dna sequence of the regulatory region and the structural gene, nrfa, for cytochrome c552 of escherichia coli k-12 have been reported. we have now established that nrfa is the first gene in a seven-gene operon, designated the nrf operon, at least five of which are essential for formate-dependent nitrite reduction to ammonia. this operon terminates just upstream of the previously sequenced gltp gene encoding a sodium-independent, glutamate and aspartate transporter. expression of lac fused to nrfa, nrfe or nrfg is regulated by oxygen repression, fnr-dependent anaerobic induction, nitrite induction and nitrate repression during anaerobic growth, exactly as previously reported for the nrfa promoter. in contrast, expression of the gltp-lac fusion was fnr-independent. the open reading frame immediately downstream of nrfa encodes nrfb, a hydrophilic, penta-haem cytochrome c with an m(r) of 20,714. the structure of the n-terminal region is typical of a signal peptide for a periplasmic protein: cleavage at the  putative signal peptide cleavage site, ala-26, would result in a periplasmic cytochrome with a molecular mass of 18 kda. the nrfc polypeptide, m(r) 24,567, contains 16 cysteine residues arranged in four clusters typical of the coof super-family of non-haem iron-sulphur proteins. the nrfd sequence predicts a 318-residue hydrophobic protein with a distribution of acidic and basic amino acids which suggests that nrfd is an integral transmembrane protein with loops in both the periplasm and the cytoplasm. proteins most similar to nrfd include the psrc subunit of polysulphide reductase from wolinella, but, as seven of the 10 most similar proteins are nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductases, we propose that nrfd participates in the transfer of electrons from the quinone pool into the terminal components of the nrf pathway. nrfe, m(r) 60,851, is predicted to be another hydrophobic, integral membrane protein homologous to the cdi1 protein of rhodobacter capsulatus, which has been implicated in the assembly of periplasmic  c-type cytochromes. the sequence of the 127 residue nrff polypeptide, m(r) 14,522, is strikingly similar to the cci2 protein of r. capsulatus, especially in the putative haem-binding motif, rcpqcqnqn.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in rhodobacter capsulatus wild-type strains, the 23s rrna is cleaved into [16s] and [14s] rrna molecules. our data show that a region predicted to form a hairpin-loop structure is removed from the 23s rrna during this processing step.  we have analyzed the processing of rrna in the wild type and in the mutant strain fm65, which does not cleave the 23s rrna. in addition to the lack of 23s rrna processing, strain fm65 shows impeded processing of a larger 5.6-kb rrna precursor and slow maturation of 23s and 16s rrnas from pre-23s and pre-16s rrna  species. similar effects have also been described previously for escherichia coli rnase iii mutants. processing of the 5.6-kb precursor was independent of protein  synthesis, while the cleavage of 23s rrna to generate 16s and 14s rrna required protein synthesis. we identified a dna fragment of the wild-type r. capsulatus chromosome that conferred normal processing of 5.6-kb rrna and 23s rrna when it was expressed in strain fm65.

AB  == genetic studies have shown that the expression of the pufq gene is required for normal levels of bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis in rhodobacter capsulatus. yet, the exact function of the pufq gene is unknown, and a pufq gene product has never been isolated. we describe the recombinant overexpression of pufq in escherichia  coli, as well as the purification and characterization of its gene product, the 74-amino-acid pufq protein. site-directed mutagenesis was used to facilitate the  cloning of the pufq gene into various expression vector systems of e. coli, including pkk223-3, plcii-fx, and pmal-c. although high levels of pufq transcription were evident from constructs of all three vectors, high levels of protein expression were apparent only in the pmal-c system. in vector pmal-c, the recombinant pufq protein is expressed as a fusion with an amino-terminal maltose-binding domain. after affinity purification on an amylose column, full-length pufq protein was released from the fusion protein by limited proteolysis with the enzyme factor xa. the pufq protein demonstrated a strong tendency to associate with phospholipid vesicles, consistent with the view that it is an integral membrane protein. the pufq protein was subsequently purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by amino-terminal sequence  analysis. a possible role for the pufq protein in the transport of bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic intermediates is discussed.

TI  == the role of mrna degradation in the regulated expression of bacterial photosynthesis genes.
AB  == regulation of gene expression in bacteria, as in eukaryotic cells, is often achieved by variation of mrna levels. since the steady state levels of mrna depend on both the rate of synthesis and the rate of decay, both mechanisms are important for gene regulation. after considerable effort undertaken over many years to understand the regulation of transcription, mrna degradation has recently gained increasing attention as an important step in the regulation of some bacterial genes, and many investigations have addressed the mechanisms involved in mrna decay. the puf mrna of rhodobacter capsulatus encoding pigment binding proteins has become a model system to study decay of a polycistronic mrna and the role of mrna degradation in gene expression. individual segments of the polycistronic puf mrna display extremely different half-lives. these differences  in stability of mrna segments are involved in the differential expression of puf  encoded genes and consequently contribute to the stoichiometry of light-harvesting i and reaction centre complexes that results in optimal growth.  in addition, control of mrna stability is involved in the oxygen-dependent regulation of photosynthesis genes. high oxygen tension results in decreased stability of the reaction-centre specific puf mrna segment, most likely by affecting the rate of endonucleolytic cleavage within the reaction centre coding  region. the results obtained from studying puf mrna degradation in r. capsulatus  and escherichia coli suggest that a specific distribution of decay promoting and  decay impeding mrna elements along the polycistronic mrna is responsible for the  different half-lives of individual puf segments.

TI  == sequence, genetic, and lacz fusion analyses of a nifr3-ntrb-ntrc operon in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == transcription of rhodobacter capsulatus genes encoding the nitrogenase polypeptides (nifhdk) is repressed by fixed nitrogen and oxygen. regulatory genes required to sense and relay the nitrogen status of the cell are glnb, ntrb (nifr2), and ntrc (nifr1). r. capsulatus nifa1 and nifa2 require ntrc for activation when fixed nitrogen is limiting. the polypeptides encoded by nifa1 and nifa2 along with the alternate sigma factor rpon activate nifhdk and the remaining nif genes in the absence of both fixed nitrogen and oxygen. in this study we report the sequence and genetic analysis of the previously identified nifr3-ntrb-ntrc regulatory locus. nifr3 is predicted to encode a 324-amino-acid protein with significant homology to an upstream open reading frame cotranscribed with the escherichia coli regulatory gene, fis. analysis of ntrc-lacz fusions and complementation data indicate that nifr3 ntrbc constitute a single operon. nifr3-lacz fusions are expressed only when lacz is in the proper reading frame with the predicted nifr3 gene product. tn5, a kanamycin-resistance cassette, and  minimu insertions in nifr3 are polar on ntrbc (required for nif transcription). this gene organization suggests that the nifr3 gene product may be involved in nitrogen regulation, although nifr3 is not stringently required for nitrogen fixation when ntrbc are present on a multicopy plasmid. in addition, a r. capsulatus strain with a 22-nucleotide insert in the chromosomal nifr3 gene was constructed. this nifr3 strain is able to fix nitrogen and activate nifa1 and nifa2 genes, again supporting the hypothesis that nifr3 is not stringently required for ntrc-dependent gene activation in r. capsulatus.

AB  == a combination of cosmid genome walking and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to construct a high-resolution physical and genetic map of the 3.8-megabase  (mb) genome of rhodobacter capsulatus sb1003. the mapping was done by hybridization of pulsed-field gel blots and by grouping and further mapping of the cosmids and bacteriophages from genomic libraries. cosmid clones formed two uninterrupted and ordered groups, one corresponding to the chromosome of r. capsulatus, the other to its 134-kb plasmid. cos site end-labeling and partial ecorv digestion of cosmids were used to construct a high-resolution ecorv map of  the genome. overlapping of the cosmids was confirmed by the resemblance of the cosmid restriction maps and by direct end-to-end hybridization with sp6- and t7-specific transcripts. twenty-three previously cloned genes and eight groups of repeated sequences, revealed in this work, were located in the ordered gene library and mapped with an accuracy of 1-10 kb. blots of a minimal set of 192 cosmids, covering the chromosome and the plasmid with the known map position of each cosmid, give to r. capsulatus the same advantages that the kohara phage panel gives to e. coli.

TI  == cytochromes c biogenesis in a photosynthetic bacterium requires a periplasmic thioredoxin-like protein.
AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus is a gram-negative photosynthetic bacterium that requires  c-type cytochromes for photosynthetic electron transport. our studies demonstrate that the gene helx is required for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes in r. capsulatus. a helx chromosomal deletion mutant cannot grow photosynthetically, due to a deficiency of all c-type cytochromes. the predicted amino acid sequence  of the helx gene product (176 residues) is related to that of thioredoxin and shares active-site homology with protein disulfide isomerase. cytochrome c2-alkaline phosphatase gene fusions are used to show that helx is not required for the transcription, translation, or secretion of apocytochrome c2. helx-alkaline phosphatase and helx-beta-galactosidase gene fusions are used to demonstrate that helx is a periplasmic protein, which is consistent with the presence of a typical signal sequence in helx. based on these results, we propose helx functions as a periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductase that is essential for cytochromes c biogenesis. this role is in accordance with the observation that both heme and the cysteines of apocytochromes c (cys-xaa-yaa-cys-his) must be in  the reduced state for covalent linkage between the two moieties to occur.

TI  == cloning and expression of the d-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase form ii gene from thiobacillus intermedius in escherichia coli.
AB  == both form i and ii ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) genes were detected in thiobacillus intermedius by heterologous hybridization using specific probes from anacystis nidulans and rhodobacter sphaeroides, respectively. however, only the previously reported form i enzyme could be demonstrated in cells grown under a number of different conditions. the reason(s) why the form ii gene is not expressed in t. intermedius is/are not clear at this  time. the form ii gene was isolated from a lambda library by screening with the rb. sphaeroides probe. a sali fragment from this clone was ligated into puc8 and  transformed into escherichia coli dh5 alpha. subclones pti20iia and pti20iib representing both orientations relative to the lac promoter were isolated. low levels of rubisco activity were detected in both induced and non-induced pti20iia indicating the probable expression from a t. intermedius promoter. induced pti20iib produced much higher levels of enzyme activity. analysis of cell-free extracts using sucrose density gradients confirmed the expression of a form ii rubisco similar in size to that found in rhodobacter capsulatus. other calvin cycle genes were not clustered with either the form i or form ii genes.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and genetic analysis of the region essential for functional expression of the gene for ferredoxin i, fdxn, in rhodobacter capsulatus: sharing of one upstream activator sequence in opposite directions by two operons related  to nitrogen fixation.
AB  == nucleotide sequencing of the region upstream of two ferredoxin genes, fdxc and fdxn, of rhodobacter capsulatus revealed the existence of one open reading frame  (orf), orfu1, in the same orientation as these genes and two other orfs, orfu2 and orfu3, in the opposite orientation. two potential -24/-12 promoters were found in front of orfu1 and orfu2, respectively, and there was a putative upstream activator sequence (uas) or nifa-binding site between them. the orfs corresponded to no known nif genes. however, analysis of their putative products  showed that the product of orfu1 (m(r) 47,912) and that of orfu3 (m(r) 19,090) had a flavodoxin-like domain and a 2[4fe-4s] ferredoxin-like domain, respectively, and that the product of orfu2 (m(r) 20,424) was a hydrophobic protein with six potential membrane-spanning portions. results of interposon mutagenesis and complementation experiments indicated that orfu2 but not orfu1 is essential for nitrogen fixation and that additional gene(s) essential for nitrogen fixation must be present in the unsequenced region adjacent to orfu3. translational fusion analysis involving laczya and fdxn or orfu3 provided evidence that the putative uas is responsible for regulation of both orfu1-fdxc-fdxn and orfu2-orfu3 operons in opposite orientations, and that the control of the latter is stricter than that of the former.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and organization of an h2-uptake gene cluster from rhizobium  leguminosarum bv. viciae containing a rubredoxin-like gene and four additional open reading frames.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 3.2 kb region following the hydrogenase structural operon (hupslcdef) in the h2-uptake gene cluster from rhizobium leguminosarum by  viciae strain 128c53 has been determined. five closely linked genes encoding products of 16.3 (hupg), 30.5 (huph), 8.0 (hupi), 18.4 (hupj) and 38.7 (hupk) kda were identified 166 bp downstream from hupf. transposon insertions into hupg, huph, hupj and hupk suppress the h2-oxidizing capability of the wild-type strain. the amino acid sequence deduced from hupi contains two cys-x-x-cys motifs, characteristic of rubredoxins, separated by 29 amino acid residues showing strong sequence homology with other bacterial rubredoxins. the amino acid-derived sequence from hupg and huph showed homology to products from genes hyae and hyaf  of the operon encoding hydrogenase 1 from escherichia coli, and hupj and hupk were related to open reading frames identified in rhodobacter capsulatus and azotobacter vinelandii hydrogenase gene clusters. an involvement of the hupghijk  gene cluster in redox reactions related to hydrogenase synthesis or activity is predicted on the basis of the function as electron carrier attributed to rubredoxin.

TI  == an algorithmically optimized combinatorial library screened by digital imaging spectroscopy.
AB  == combinatorial cassettes based on a phylogenetic "target set" were used to simultaneously mutagenize seven amino acid residues on one face of a transmembrane alpha helix comprising a bacteriochlorophyll binding site in the light harvesting ii antenna of rhodobacter capsulatus. this pigmented protein provides a model system for developing complex mutagenesis schemes, because simple absorption spectroscopy can be used to assay protein expression, structure, and function. colony screening by digital imaging spectroscopy showed  that 6% of the optimized library bound bacteriochlorophyll in two distinct spectroscopic classes. this is approximately 200 times the throughput (ca. 0.03%) of conventional combinatorial cassette mutagenesis using [nn(g/c)]. "doping" algorithms evaluated in this model system are generally applicable and should enable simultaneous mutagenesis at more positions in a protein than currently possible, or alternatively, decrease the screening size of combinatorial libraries.

TI  == the rate of decay of rhodobacter capsulatus-specific puf mrna segments is differentially affected by rnase e activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == in rhodobacter capsulatus the puf operon encodes proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus. the polycistronic puf mrna is comprised of segments that show differential stability. here, we show that the rate of decay of the 2.7-kb pufbalmx mrna species in escherichia coli depends on the activity of ribonuclease e (rnase e), whereas the degradation of the 0.5-kb pufba mrna segment is not affected by a mutation in the rne gene. the rnase e-promoted decay of the puflmx  mrna depends on the presence of a 1.4-kb puflm mrna segment, in which rate-limiting endonucleolytic cleavage was postulated to occur in r. capsulatus.  the insertion of 185 bp of this 1.4-kb segment into pufb results in an rnase e-dependent decay of the modified pufba mrna segment in e. coli. our findings suggest that in r. capsulatus an rnase e-like activity is responsible for the rate-limiting endonucleolytic cleavage occurring within the puflm mrna segment, whereas the 0.5-kb pufba mrna segment is degraded by a different rnase e-independent decay mechanism.

TI  == use of hups::lacz gene fusion to study regulation of hydrogenase expression in rhodobacter capsulatus: stimulation by h2.
AB  == the escherichia coli beta-galactosidase enzyme was used as a reporter molecule for genetic fusions in rhodobacter capsulatus. dna fragments that were from the upstream region of the hydrogenase structural operon hupslm and contained 5' hups sequences were fused in frame to a promoterless lacz gene, yielding fusion proteins comprising the putative signal sequence and the first 22 amino acids of  the hups protein joined to the eight amino acid of beta-galactosidase. we demonstrate the usefulness of the hups::lacz fusion in monitoring regulation of hydrogenase gene expression. the activities of plasmid-determined beta-galactosidase and chromosome-encoded hydrogenase changed in parallel in response to various growth conditions (light or dark, aerobiosis or anaerobiosis, and presence or absence of ammonia or of h2), showing that changes in hydrogenase activity were due to changes in enzyme synthesis. molecular hydrogen stimulated hydrogenase synthesis in dark, aerobic cultures and in illuminated, anaerobic cultures. analysis of hups::lacz expression in various mutants indicated that neither the hydrogenase structural genes nor nifr4 (sigma 54) was essential for hydrogen regulation of hydrogenase synthesis.

TI  == purification and characterization of a catalase-peroxidase from the fungus septoria tritici.
AB  == three classes of heme proteins, commonly designated hydroperoxidases, are involved in the metabolism of hydrogen peroxide: catalases, peroxidases, and catalase-peroxidases. while catalases and peroxidases are widely spread in animals, plants, and microorganisms, catalase-peroxidases were characterized only in prokaryotes. we report here, for the first time, on a catalase-peroxidase in a eukaryotic organism. the enzyme was purified from the fungal wheat pathogen septoria tritici, and is one of three different hydroperoxidases synthesized by this organism. the s. tritici catalase-peroxidase, designated stcp, is similar to the enzymes previously isolated from the bacteria rhodobacter capsulatus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae, although it is significantly more sensitive to denaturing conditions. in addition to its catalatic activity stcp catalyzes peroxidatic activity with o-dianisidine, diaminobenzidine, pyrogallol,  nadh, and nadph as electron donors. the enzyme is a tetramer with identical subunits of 61,000 da molecular weight. stcp shows a typical high-spin ferric heme spectrum with a soret band at 405 nm and a peak at 632 nm, and binding of cyanide causes a shift of the soret band to 421 nm, the appearance of a peak at 537 nm, and abolition of the peak at 632 nm. reduction with dithionite results in a decrease in the intensity of the soret band and its shift to 436 nm, and in the appearance of a peak at 552 nm. the ph optimum is 6-6.5 and 5.4 for the catalatic and peroxidatic activities, respectively. fifty percent of the apparent maximal activity is reached at 3.4 mm and 0.26 mm for the catalatic and peroxidatic activities, respectively. the enzyme is inactivated by ethanol/chloroform, and is inhibited by kcn and nan3, but not by the typical catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.

TI  == the relation between the soluble factor associated with h(+)-transhydrogenase of  rhodospirillum rubrum and the enzyme from mitochondria and escherichia coli.
AB  == although in mitochondria, escherichia coli and rhodobacter capsulatus the h(+)-transhydrogenases are intrinsic membrane proteins, in rhodospirillum rubrum  a water-soluble component (ths) and a membrane-bound component are together required for activity. ths was selectively removed from chromatophore membranes of rhs. rubrum and was purified to homogeneity by precipitation with (nh4)2so4 and ion-exchange, affinity dye and gel exclusion chromatography. the latter indicated an mr of approx. 74,000 under non-denaturing conditions but analysis of the pure protein by sds-page revealed a single polypeptide, mr 43,000. antibodies against this polypeptide inhibited transhydrogenase activity of chromatophores and decreased the capacity of ths to restore activity to depleted membranes. they reacted with a polypeptide of mr 43,000 in crude cell extract, chromatophore membranes and chromatophore washings but not with transhydrogenase polypeptides from the membranes of e. coli, rb. capsulatus or animal mitochondria. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the 43,000 polypeptide was strongly homologous  with the reported n-terminal regions of mitochondrial transhydrogenase and the alpha subunit of the e. coli protein. the break between the alpha and beta polypeptides of e. coli transhydrogenase is such that both components are membrane-associated. in contrast, these results suggest that in the rhs. rubrum enzyme ths has been formed by a break closer to the n-terminus, thus avoiding the putative trans-membrane helical segments and yielding a relatively hydrophilic subunit, which is water-soluble. there is a predicted similarity between ths and  the reported sequence of alanine dehydrogenase from bacillus but ths did not have any alanine dehydrogenase activity.

(1992) biochim. biophys. acta 1131, 122-124). sequencing of 6008 base pairs of dna immediately downstream from orf2 revealed six additional orfs (orf3 through orf8). all six orfs are transcribed from the same dna strand as that of the orf1 and orf2. deduced amino acid sequences of orf3 through orf5, and those of orf4, orf5, orf7 and orf8 have strong homology with genes required for dihydrogen (h2) metabolism in rhodobacter capsulatus and  in escherichia coli, respectively. orf4, orf5, orf6 and orf8 would encode for polypeptides containing one or more 'cys-x-x-cys' motifs. the predicted products  of orf5 and orf6 each contain a histidine-rich region, and the product of orf5 also includes a 'cys-thr-val-cys-gly-cys' region near its amino-terminus. implications of these findings with respect to metal binding, transport and incorporation, to hydrogenase assembly and to h2 metabolism are discussed.

AB  == a 257-amino acid (aa) open reading frame in the photosynthetic bacterium, rhodobacter capsulatus, shows significant homology to the mitochondrial enoyl-coa hydratase (290 aa). this similarity in size and sequence suggests that r. capsulatus oxidizes fatty acids using specific components, more like the mitochondrial system than the multifunctional component system of escherichia coli.

TI  == the hydrogenase structural operon in rhodobacter capsulatus contains a third gene, hupm, necessary for the formation of a physiologically competent hydrogenase.
AB  == the hupm gene, previously called orfx, found downstream from and contiguous with  the structural hydrogenase genes hups and hupl in rhodobacter capsulatus, is shown here to form a single hupslm transcription unit with the two other genes. the hupm gene was inactivated by interposon mutagenesis. the two selected mutants, bcx1 and bcx2, which contained the kanamycin-resistance gene in opposite orientation, still exhibited hydrogenase activity when assayed with the artificial electron acceptors benzylviologen and methylene blue. however, the hydrogenase was not physiologically active in these mutants, which could not grow autotrophically and were unable to recycle electrons to nitrogenase or to respire on h2. the hupm gene starts nine base pairs downstream from the tga stop codon of hupl gene, which encodes the large subunit of the [nife]hydrogenase of rhodobacter capsulatus. the three contiguous genes hups, hupl and hupm were subcloned downstream from the promoter of hupsl, either with the promoter in the  correct orientation (plasmid pbc8) or with the promoter in the opposite orientation (plasmid pbc9), then the constructs were introduced into the mutant strains. only plasmid pbc8 could restore the formation of a competent hydrogenase in mutants bcx1 and bcx2, indicating that the hupm gene is expressed only from the hupsl promoter.

TI  == a common channel-forming motif in evolutionarily distant porins.
AB  == four new crystal packings of escherichia coli porins are presented (phosphoporin, maltoporin, and two crystal forms of matrix porin). these were determined by molecular replacement methods using a polyalanine trial model acquired from the refined coordinates of porin from rhodobacter capsulatus. the successful molecular replacement shows that the dominant motif found in r. capsulatus porin  (a 16-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel) also applies to the e. coli porins, despite the lack of significant amino acid sequence homology. a 30 degrees-40 degrees tilt of the beta-strands with respect to the membrane normal was derived  from the intensity distributions in the x-ray diffraction patterns for each porin studied, stressing their similarity. in view of the evolutionary distance between enteric and photosynthetic bacteria, the antiparallel beta-barrel may have significance as a basic structural motif for the formation of bacterial membrane  channel structures.

TI  == fructose catabolism in xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris. sequence of the pts operon, characterization of the fructose-specific enzymes.
AB  == in xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, fructose is transported and phosphorylated into fructose 1-phosphate through a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent  phosphotransferase system. the nucleotide sequence of the frua gene encoding the  phosphotransferase system permease specific of fructose (eiifru) was determined.  the fructose 1-phosphate produced by the phosphotransferase system is phosphorylated into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by a 1-phosphofructokinase. this enzyme was characterized and the corresponding gene (fruk) was sequenced. sequence comparisons revealed that fruk is a member of a new family of atp-binding proteins composed of sugar (or sugar-phosphate) kinases. in phosphotransferase system-deficient strains, fructose can still be transported by an unidentified permease. the intracellular fructose is then phosphorylated by a  multimeric fructokinase of 135 kda specific for fructose and inhibited by fructose, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and mannose. several other enzymes of fructose metabolism were assayed and a potential pathway for fructose catabolism  is presented.

TI  == the bacterial porin superfamily: sequence alignment and structure prediction.
AB  == the porins of gram-negative bacteria are responsible for the 'molecular sieve' properties of the outer membrane. they form large water-filled channels which allow the diffusion of hydrophilic molecules into the periplasmic space. owing to the strong hydrophilicity of their amino acid sequence and the nature of their secondary structure (beta strands), conventional hydropathy methods for predicting membrane topology are useless for this class of protein. the large number of available porin amino acid sequences was exploited to improve the accuracy of the prediction in combination with tools detecting amphipathicity of  secondary structure. using the constraints of beta-sheet structure these porins are predicted to contain 16 membrane-spanning strands, 14 of which are common to  the two (enteric and the neisserial) porin subfamilies.

AB  == long-chain dehydrogenases were scrutinized for common patterns. overall molecular similarities are not discerned, in contrast to the situation for several short-chain and medium-chain dehydrogenases, but coenzyme-binding segments are discernible. species variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reveal about 20% strictly conserved residues, grouped into three segments and supporting assignments of sites for coenzyme-binding and catalysis. glycine is overrepresented among the residues conserved, typical of distantly related proteins. two of the enzymes within the pentose phosphate pathway reveal a distant similarity of interest for further evaluation, between a c-terminal 178-residue segment of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the n-terminal part  of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the rhodobacter capsulatus fruk gene, which encodes fructose-1-phosphate kinase: evidence for a kinase superfamily including both phosphofructokinases of escherichia coli.
AB  == the fruk gene encoding fructose-1-phosphate kinase (fruk), located within the fructose (fru)-catabolic operon of rhodobacter capsulatus, was sequenced. fruk of r. capsulatus (316 amino acids; molecular weight = 31,232) is the same size as and is homologous to fruk of escherichia coli, phosphofructokinase b (pfkb) of e. coli, phosphotagatokinase of staphylococcus aureus, and ribokinase of e. coli. these proteins therefore make up a family of homologous proteins, termed the pfkb family. a phylogenetic tree for this new family was constructed. sequence comparisons plus chemical inactivation studies suggested the lack of involvement  of specific residues in catalysis. although the rhodobacter fruk differed markedly from the other enzymes within the pfkb family with respect to amino acid composition, these enzymes exhibited similar predicted secondary structural features. a large internal segment of the rhodobacter fruk was found to be similar in sequence to the domain bearing the sugar bisphosphate-binding region of the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase of plants and bacteria. proteins of the pfkb family did not exhibit statistically significant sequence identity with pfka of e. coli. pfka, however, is homologous  to other prokaryotic and eukaryotic atp- and ppi-dependent pfks (the pfka family). these eukaryotic, atp-dependent enzymes each consist of a homotetramer (mammalian) or a heterooctamer (yeasts), with each subunit containing an internal duplication of the size of the entire pfka protein of e. coli. in some of these enzymes, additional domains are present. a phylogenetic tree was constructed for  the pfka family and revealed that the bacterial enzymes closely resemble the n-terminal domains of the eukaryotic enzyme subunits whereas the c-terminal domains have diverged more extensively. the ppi-dependent pfk of potato is only distantly related to the atp-dependent enzymes. on the basis of their similar functions, sizes, predicted secondary structures, and sequences, we suggest that  the pfka and pfkb families share a common evolutionary origin.

TI  == expression of regulatory nif genes in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == translational fusions of the escherichia coli lacz gene to rhodobacter capsulatus nif genes were constructed in order to determine the regulatory circuit of nif gene expression in r. capsulatus, a free-living photosynthetic diazotroph. the expression of nifh, nifa (copies i and ii), and nifr4 was measured in different regulatory mutant strains under different physiological conditions. the expression of nifh and nifr4 (the analog of ntra in klebsiella pneumoniae) depends on the nifr1/r2 system (the analog of the ntr system in k. pneumoniae), on nifa, and on nifr4. the expression of both copies of nifa is regulated by the  nifr1/r2 system and is modulated by the n source of the medium under anaerobic photosynthetic growth conditions. in the presence of ammonia or oxygen, moderate  expression of nifa was detectable, whereas nifh and nifr4 were not expressed under these conditions. the implications for the regulatory circuit of nif gene expression in r. capsulatus are discussed and compared with the situation in k. pneumoniae, another free-living diazotroph.

TI  == purification and properties of the h(+)-nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase  from rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == 1. h(+)-transhydrogenase from rhodobacter capsulatus is an integral membrane protein which, unlike the enzyme from rhodospirillum rubrum, does not require the presence of a water-soluble component for activity. 2. the enzyme from rb. capsulatus was solubilised in triton x-100 and subjected to ion-exchange, hydroxyapatite and then gel-exclusion column chromatography. sds/page of the purified enzyme revealed the presence of two polypeptides with apparent mr 53,000 and 48,000. other minor components which were stained on the electrophoresis gels or which were revealed on western blots exposed to antibodies raised to total membrane proteins, were probably contaminants. 3. antibodies raised to the 53-kda and 48-kda polypeptides cross-reacted with equivalent polypeptides in western blots of solubilised membranes from rb. capsulatus, rhodobacter sphaeroides and rhs. rubrum. the significance of this finding is discussed in the context of the  hypothesis [fisher, r.r. & earle, s.r. (1982) the pyridine nucleotide coenzymes,  pp. 279-324, academic press, new york] that the soluble component associated with h(+)-transhydrogenase from rhs. rubrum is an integral part of the catalytic machinery. antibodies against the 48-kda and 53-kda polypeptides of the rb. capsulatus enzyme cross-reacted with equivalent polypeptides in solubilised membranes of escherichia coli. 4. the dependence of the rate of h- transfer by purified h(+)-transhydrogenase on the nucleotide substrate concentrations under steady-state conditions, the effects of inhibition by nucleotide products and the inhibition by 2'-amp and by 5'-amp suggest that the reaction proceeds by the random addition of substrates to the enzyme with the formation of a ternary complex. 5. in conflict with this conclusion, the reduction of acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (acpdad+) by nadh in the absence of nadp+ by bacterial membranes was earlier taken as evidence for the existence of a reduced enzyme intermediate [fisher, r.r. & earle, s.r. (1982) the pyridine nucleotide coenzymes, pp. 279-324, academic press, new york]. however, it is shown here that although chromatophore membranes of rb. capsulatus catalysed the reduction of acpdad+ by nadh, the reaction was not associated with the purified h(+)-transhydrogenase. moreover, in contrast with the true transhydrogenase reaction, the reconstitution of acpdad+ reduction by nadh (in the absence of nadp+) in washed membranes of rhs. rubrum with partially purified transhydrogenase factor, was only additive.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 4.1 kb dna fragment containing the fixabc region of  azorhizobium caulinodans was established. the three gene products were very similar to the corresponding polypeptides of rhizobium meliloti. the c-terminal domains of both fixb products displayed a high degree of similarity with the alpha-subunits of rat and human electron transfer flavoproteins, suggesting a role for the fixb protein in a redox reaction. two open reading frames (orf) were found downstream of fixc. the first orf was identified as fixx on the basis of sequence homology with fixx from several rhizobium and bradyrhizobium strains. the second orf potentially encoded a 69 amino acid product and was found to be homologous to a dna region in the rhodobacter capsulatus nif cluster i. insertion mutagenesis of the a. caulinodans fixx gene conferred a nif- phenotype to bacteria growth in the free-living state and a fix- phenotype in symbiotic association with the host plant sesbania rostrata. a crude extract from the fixx  mutant had no nitrogenase activity. furthermore, data presented in this paper also indicate that the previously identified nifo gene located upstream of fixa was probably a homologue of the nifw gene of klebsiella pneumoniae and azotobacter vinelandii.

AB  == the green sulfur bacterium, chlorobium vibrioforme, synthesizes the tetrapyrrole  precursor, delta-aminolevulinic acid (ala), from glutamate via the rna-dependent  five-carbon pathway. a 1.9-kb clone of genomic dna from c. vibrioforme that is capable of transforming a glutamyl-trna reductase-deficient, ala-dependent, hema  mutant of escherichia coli to prototrophy was sequenced. the transforming c. vibrioforme dna has significant sequence similarity to the e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and bacillus subtilis hema genes and contains a 1245 base open reading frame that encodes a 415 amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 46174. this polypeptide has over 28% amino acid identity with the polypeptides deduced from the nucleic acid sequences of the e. coli, s. typhimurium, and b. subtilis hema genes. no sequence similarity was detected, at  either the nucleic acid or the peptide level, with the rhodobacter capsulatus or  bradyrhizobium japonicum hema genes, which encode ala synthase, or with the s. typhimurium heml gene, which encodes glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase. these results establish that hema encodes glutamyl-trna reductase in species that use the five-carbon ala biosynthetic pathway. a second region of the cloned dna,  located downstream from the hema gene, has significant sequence similarity to the e. coli and b. subtilis hemc genes. this region contains a potential open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide that has high sequence identity to the deduced e. coli and b. subtilis hemc peptides. hemc encodes the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic enzyme, porphobilinogen deaminase, in these species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the frua gene, encoding the fructose permease of the rhodobacter capsulatus phosphotransferase system, and analyses of the deduced protein sequence.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the frua gene, the terminal gene in the fructose operon of rhodobacter capsulatus, is reported. this gene codes for the fructose permease (molecular weight, 58,575; 578 aminoacyl residues), the fructose enzyme  ii (iifru) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. the deduced aminoacyl sequence of the encoded gene product was found to be 55% identical throughout most of its length with the fructose enzyme ii of escherichia coli, with some regions strongly conserved and others weakly conserved. sequence comparisons revealed that the first 100 aminoacyl residues of both enzymes ii were homologous to the second 100 residues, suggesting that an intragenic duplication of about 300 nucleotides had occurred during the evolution of iifru prior to divergence of the e. coli and r. capsulatus genes. the protein  contains only two cysteyl residues, and only one of these residues is conserved between the two proteins. this residue is therefore presumed to provide the active-site thiol group which may serve as the phosphorylation site. iifru was found to exhibit regions of homology with sequenced enzymes ii from other bacteria, including those specific for sucrose, beta-glucosides, mannitol, glucose, n-acetylglucosamine, and lactose. the degree of evolutionary divergence  differed for different parts of the proteins, with certain transmembrane segments exhibiting high degrees of conservation. the hydrophobic domain of iifru was also found to be similar to several uniport and antiport transporters of animals, including the human and mouse insulin-responsive glucose facilitators. these observations suggest that the mechanism of transmembrane transport may be similar for permeases catalyzing group translocation and facilitated diffusion.

TI  == cloning and sequence of the salmonella typhimurium heml gene and identification of the missing enzyme in heml mutants as glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase.
AB  == salmonella typhimurium forms the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid (ala) exclusively from glutamate via the five-carbon pathway, which also occurs in plants and some bacteria including escherichia coli, rather than by ala synthase-catalyzed condensation of glycine and succinyl-coenzyme a, which occurs  in yeasts, fungi, animal cells, and some bacteria including bradyrhizobium japonicum and rhodobacter capsulatus. ala-auxotrophic heml mutant s. typhimurium  cells are deficient in glutamate-1-semialdehyde (gsa) aminotransferase, the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of ala synthesis via the five-carbon pathway. heml cells transformed with a plasmid containing the s. typhimurium heml gene did not require ala for growth and had gsa aminotransferase activity. growth in the presence of ala did not appreciably affect the level of extractable gsa aminotransferase activity in wild-type cells or in heml cells transformed with the heml plasmid. these results indicate that gsa aminotransferase activity is required for in vivo ala biosynthesis from glutamate. in contrast, extracts of both wild-type and heml cells had gamma,delta-dioxovalerate aminotransferase activity, which indicates that this reaction is not catalyzed by gsa aminotransferase and that the enzyme is not encoded by the heml gene. the s. typhimurium heml gene was sequenced and determined to contain an open reading frame of 426 codons encoding a 45.3-kda polypeptide. the sequence of the heml gene bears no recognizable similarity to the hema gene of s. typhimurium or e. coli, which encodes glutamyl-trna reductase, or to the hema genes of b. japonicum or r. capsulatus, which encode ala synthase. the predicted heml gene product does show greater than 50% identity to barley gsa aminotransferase over its entire length. sequence similarity to other aminotransferases was also detected.

TI  == elucidation of the erwinia uredovora carotenoid biosynthetic pathway by functional analysis of gene products expressed in escherichia coli.
AB  == the most important function of carotenoid pigments, especially beta-carotene in higher plants, is to protect organisms against photooxidative damage (g. britton, in t. w. goodwin, ed., plant pigments--1988, 1988; n. i. krinsky, in o. isler, h. gutmann, and u. solms, ed., carotenoids--1971, 1971). beta-carotene also functions as a precursor of vitamin a in mammals (g. a. j. pitt, in i. osler, h.  gutmann, and u. solms, ed., carotenoids--1971, 1971). the enzymes and genes which mediate the biosynthesis of cyclic carotenoids such as beta-carotene are virtually unknown. we have elucidated for the first time the pathway for biosynthesis of these carotenoids at the level of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, using bacterial carotenoid biosynthesis genes. these genes were cloned from a phytopathogenic bacterium, erwinia uredovora 20d3 (atcc 19321), in escherichia coli and located on a 6,918-bp fragment whose nucleotide sequence was determined. six open reading frames were found and designated the crte, crtx, crty, crti, crtb, and crtz genes in reference to the carotenoid biosynthesis genes of a photosynthetic bacterium, rhodobacter capsulatus; only crtz had the opposite orientation from the others. the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in erwinia uredovora was clarified by analyzing carotenoids accumulated in e. coli transformants in which some of these six genes were expressed, as follows: geranylgeranyl ppicrtb----prephytoene ppicrte----phytoenecrti---- lycopenecrty----beta-carotenecrtz----zeaxanthincrtx--- -zeaxanthin-beta- diglucoside. the carotenoids in this pathway appear to be close to those in higher plants rather than to those in bacteria. also significant is that only one gene product (crti) for the conversion of phytoene to lycopene is required, a conversion in which four sequential desaturations should occur via the intermediates phytofluene, zeta-carotene, and neurosporene.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of carotenoid biosynthesis mutants of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == we have used genetic and biochemical techniques to study carotenoid biosynthesis  (crt) mutants of rhodobacter capsulatus, a purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium. all nine identified crt genes are located within the 46-kilobase pair  photosynthesis gene cluster, and eight of the crt genes form a subcluster. we have studied the operon structure of the crt gene cluster using transposon tn5.7  mutants. the tn5.7 insertion sites in 10 mutants have been mapped to high resolution (25-267 base pairs) by southern hybridization. two insertions each map within the coding regions of the crta, crtc, crte, and crtf genes, and one insertion lies within the crti gene. the insertion in crti is not polar on the downstream crtb gene, suggesting that crti and crtb may form two separate operons. another insertion located in the 5' noncoding region between the divergent crta and crti genes has no effect on wild-type pigmentation and apparently lies between the promoters for these operons. a tn5.7 mutation in the  3' region of crta yields a bacteriochlorophyll-minus phenotype, while a 5' insertion affects only carotenoid biosynthesis. regulatory signals for transcription of a downstream operon required for bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis may thus overlap the coding region of crta. we also present the first evidence for the functions of the crtb, crte, and crtj gene products using  a new in vitro assay for the incorporation of [14c]isopentenyl pyrophosphate into carotenoid precursors and phytoene in cell-free extracts. extracts from a crte mutant accumulate [14c]prephytoene pyrophosphate, while those from crtb and crtj  mutants accumulate [14c]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. we therefore propose that crte is the phytoene synthetase and that crtb, and possibly crtj, are components  of the prephytoene pyrophosphate synthetase.

AB  == the rhodobacter capsulatus hema gene, coding for the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic  acid synthase (alas), was isolated from a genome bank by hybridization with a hemt probe from rhodobacter sphaeroides. subcloning of the initial 3.9 kb hindiii fragment allowed the isolation of a 2.5 kb hindiii-bglii fragment which was able  to complement the delta-aminolevulinic acid-requiring (ala-requiring) escherichia coli mutant shsp19. dna sequencing revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein with 401 amino acids which displayed similarity to the amino acid sequences of other known alass. however, no resemblance was seen to the hema protein of e. coli k12. based on the sequence data, an ala-requiring mutant strain of r. capsulatus was constructed by site-directed insertion mutagenesis. introduction of a plasmid, containing the hema gene of r. capsulatus on the 3.9 kb hindiii fragment, restored ala-independent growth of the mutant indicating that there is only one gene for ala biosynthesis in r. capsulatus. transfer of the r' factor prps404 and hybridization analysis revealed that the alas gene is not located within the major photosynthetic gene cluster.

TI  == inactivation, sequence, and lacz fusion analysis of a regulatory locus required for repression of nitrogen fixation genes in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == transcription of the genes that code for proteins involved in nitrogen fixation in free-living diazotrophs is typically repressed by high internal oxygen concentrations or exogenous fixed nitrogen. the dna sequence of a regulatory locus required for repression of rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation genes was determined. it was shown that this locus, defined by tn5 insertions and by ethyl methanesulfonate-derived mutations, is homologous to the glnb gene of other organisms. the r. capsulatus glnb gene was upstream of glna, the gene for glutamine synthetase, in a glnba operon. beta-galactosidase expression from an r. capsulatus glnba-lacz translational fusion was increased twofold in cells induced by nitrogen limitation relative to that in cells under nitrogen-sufficient conditions. r. capsulatus nifr1, a gene that was previously shown to be homologous to ntrc and that is required for transcription of nitrogen fixation genes, was responsible for approximately 50% of the transcriptional activation of this glnba fusion in cells induced under nitrogen-limiting conditions. r. capsulatus glnb, nifr1, and nifr2 (a protein homologous to ntrb) were proposed to transduce the nitrogen status in the cell into repression or activation of other  r. capsulatus nif genes. repression of nif genes in response to oxygen was still  present in r. capsulatus glnb mutants and must have occurred at a different level of control in the regulatory circuit.

TI  == molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the structural gene of ferredoxin i from the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the structural gene (fdxn) encoding ferredoxin i (fdi) in the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus was isolated from a cosmid library by using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the n-terminal amino acid sequence of fdi. the nucleotide sequences of the gene and of the 3'- and 5'-flanking regions were  determined. the gene fdxn codes for a polypeptide of 64 mino acids having a calculated molecular weight of 6,728. amino acid sequencing of the n- and c-terminal ends of fdi allowed the determination of 86% of the primary structure  and confirmed that fdi is the fdxn gene product. sequence comparisons indicate that fdi shares common structural features with ferredoxins containing two [4fe-4s] clusters, including eight conserved cysteines. maximal homology was found with a ferredoxin from rhodo-pseudomonas palustris. northern (rna) hybridization using a 158-base-pair dna fragment internal to the fdxn coding region revealed the existence of two mrna transcripts of approximately 330 and 750 nucleotides. neither of those transcripts was present under nif-repressing growth conditions. the 5' end of the smaller transcript was mapped by s1 nuclease protection and primer extension experiments. on the basis of southern hybridization experiments, by using probes homologous to fdxn, nife, and a fragment complementing a nif point mutation, fdxn was localized inside a cluster  of nif genes.

TI  == the cytochrome bc1 complex of rhodobacter sphaeroides can restore cytochrome c2-independent photosynthetic growth to a rhodobacter capsulatus mutant lacking cytochrome bc1.
AB  == plasmids encoding the structural genes for the rhodobacter capsulatus and rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome (cyt) bc1 complexes were introduced into strains of r. capsulatus lacking the cyt bc1 complex, with and without cyt c2. the r. capsulatus merodiploids contained higher than wild-type levels of cyt bc1  complex, as evidenced by immunological and spectroscopic analyses. on the other hand, the r. sphaeroides-r. capsulatus hybrid merodiploids produced only barely detectable amounts of r. sphaeroides cyt bc1 complex in r. capsulatus. nonetheless, when they contained cyt c2, they were capable of photosynthetic growth, as judged by the sensitivity of this growth to specific inhibitors of the photochemical reaction center and the cyt bc1 complex, such as atrazine, myxothiazol, and stigmatellin. interestingly, in the absence of cyt c2, although  the r. sphaeroides cyt bc1 complex was able to support the photosynthetic growth  of a cyt bc1-less mutant of r. capsulatus in rich medium, it was unable to do so  when c4 dicarboxylic acids, such as malate and succinate, were used as the sole carbon source. even this conditional ability of r. sphaeroides cyt bc1 complex to replace that of r. capsulatus for photosynthetic growth suggests that in the latter species the cyt c2-independent rereduction of the reaction center is not due to a structural property unique to the r. capsulatus cyt bc1 complex. similarly, the inability of r. sphaeroides to exhibit a similar pathway is not due to some inherent property of its cyt bc1 complex.

TI  == immunological detection of phytoene desaturase in algae and higher plants using an antiserum raised against a bacterial fusion-gene construct.
AB  == immunological characterization of phytoene desaturase, a key enzyme of carotenoid biosynthesis, is reported. for this purpose, a phytoene-desaturase fusion protein has been employed. for its construction 921 base pairs of the crti gene were fused to the n-terminal region of the escherichia coli lacz gene. plasmid pgabx2  resulted from insertion of a bgli - xhoi fragment from the rhodobacter capsulatus carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster, carrying the crti, crta and crtb genes, into pbr322. a 968-base-pair sali-fragment from pgabx2 was cloned into pur288 at  the 3' end of the lacz gene. isopropyl-beta-d-thio-galactopyranoside-dependent activation of the lacz fusion gene resulted in expression of a stable 150-kda protein. after electroelution from sds/polyacrylamide slab gels, the protein was  used for antibody production. the heterogenic antiserum obtained was tested by western blotting against proteins from rhodobacter capsulatus and several different photoautotrophic organisms including higher plants. apparent molecular  masses of immunoreactive proteins from rhodobacter, aphanocapsa, rape and spinach were around 64 kda. in bumilleriopsis a 55-kda protein was found instead. the antibody also inhibited in vitro desaturation of phytoene when detergent-solubilized membranes were employed.

TI  == genes downstream from pucb and puca are essential for formation of the b800-850 complex of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the formation of the light-harvesting complex b800-850 (lh-ii) of rhodobacter capsulatus requires, in addition to the synthesis of the polypeptides alpha and beta (the gene products of puca and pucb), the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoids and the expression of at least one gene localized downstream from the pucba operon. this was concluded from the observation that a tn5 insertion downstream from pucba inhibited the formation of the lh-ii complex and the formation of the pucba mrna. the tn5 insertion point was mapped and found to be over 500 base pairs (bp) downstream from the end of the puca gene, suggesting the presence of additional puc genes. a region of about 3,000 bp including the pucb and puca genes and dna downstream from puca was sequenced and found to contain three open reading frames (orfs c, d, and e). the polypeptide deduced from the first orf (c) contains 403 amino acids with strongly hydrophobic stretches and one large and three small hydrophilic domains carrying many charged residues. the other two orfs contain 113 (d) and 118 (e) codons. the amino acid sequences of the n terminus and two tryptic peptides of an alkaline-soluble mr-14,000 subunit  of the isolated lh-ii complex were identical with the deduced amino acid sequence of orf e.

TI  == carotenoid biosynthesis in photosynthetic bacteria. genetic characterization of the rhodobacter capsulatus crti protein.
AB  == carotenoids are photoprotective pigments present in many photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic organisms. the desaturation of phytoene into phytofluene is an  early step in the biosynthetic pathway that in the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus is mediated by the product of the crti gene. here we report the sequence of this gene and the identification of crti as a membrane protein of approximate mr 60,000. mutant strains with 5-fold lower or 10-fold higher levels of crti with respect to wild type have only small differences in their carotenoid content, indicating that the cellular concentration of crti is not a limiting factor in carotenoid biosynthesis. however, a correlation was found between the levels of crti and the formation of a photosynthetic antenna system.

TI  == gene transfer system for rhodopseudomonas viridis.
AB  == a gene transfer system for rhodopseudomonas viridis was established which uses conjugation with escherichia coli s17-i as the donor and mobilizable plasmids as  vectors. initially, plasmids of the incompatibility group p1 (prk290 and prk404)  were used. the more effective shuttle vectors between e. coli and r. viridis, pkv1 and pkvs1, were derived from plasmid pbr322 and showed the highest conjugation frequency (10(-2] thus far demonstrated in purple bacteria. it was also demonstrated that rhizobium meliloti can be used as a donor for conjugation  with r. viridis. from a genomic cosmid library of r. viridis constructed in the vector phc79, clones that coded for subunits h (puh operon), l, m and cytochrome  c (puf operon) of the photosynthetic reaction center were isolated and characterized. for linkage of the two operons on the genome, cosmids that overlapped with the operon-carrying clones were identified. the relative positions of the two operons could not be determined, but the operons must be more than 100 kilobase pairs apart. thus, the genomic organization of the reaction center in r. viridis is different from that of rhodobacter capsulatus, for which a distance of about 39 kilobase pairs was determined. from a spontaneous mutant of r. viridis that is resistant to the herbicide terbutryn, the puf operon was cloned in pkvs1 and transferred by conjugation into r. viridis wild-type cells. the resulting exconjugants were resistant to the herbicide, which demonstrated that the puf operon on pkvs1 constructions was functionally expressed in r. viridis.

TI  == isolation of a high frequency donor of rhodobacter capsulatus by integration of the plasmid pmt1000 into the chromosome.
AB  == the temperature-independent clone of rhodobacter capsulatus ua7041, carrying the  temperature-sensitive plasmid pmt1000, has been obtained by selection for plasmid markers at the non-permissive temperature. the transfer to escherichia coli of all drug resistance encoded by pmt1000 was of about 10(-7) when the donor was the ua7041 strain, and of 5 x 10(-4) when the donor was the temperature-sensitive strain of r. capsulatus. electrophoretic analyses showed no plasmid band typical  of the autonomous pmt1000 in the ua7041 strain. furthermore, ua7041 cells were also able to mobilize chromosomal markers of r. capsulatus at a frequency of about 10(-4) per donor cell. all these results lead us to conclude that the plasmid pmt1000 is integrated in the chromosome of the ua7041 strain. the analysis of the co-transfer frequencies of trp and his markers has shown that the chromosome mobilization in the ua7041 strain of r. capsulatus is unidirectional from a single origin. our data also show that the pmt1000 plasmid may be useful to the construction of chromosomal, high-frequency donor strains.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, organization, and nature of the protein products of the carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == carotenoid pigments are essential for the protection of both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues from photooxidative damage. although carotenoid biosynthesis has been studied in many organisms from bacteria to higher plants, little is known about carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes, or the nature and regulation of the genes encoding them. we report here the first dna sequence of carotenoid genes from any organism. we have determined the complete nucleotide sequence (11,039 bp) of a gene cluster encoding seven of the eight previously known carotenoid genes (crta, b, c, d, e, f, i) and a new gene, designated crtk,  from rhodobacter capsulatus, a purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium. the 5' flanking regions of crta, i, d and e contain a highly conserved palindromic sequence homologous to the consensus binding site for a variety of prokaryotic dna-binding regulatory proteins. this putative regulatory palindrome is also found 5' to the puc operon, encoding the light-harvesting ii antenna polypeptides. escherichia coli-like sigma 70 promoter sequences are located 5' to crti and crtd, suggesting for the first time that such promoters may exist in purple photosynthetic bacteria. the crt genes form a minimum of four distinct operons, crta, crtibk, crtdc and crtef, based on inversions of transcriptional orientation within the gene cluster. possible rho-independent transcription terminators are located 3' to crti, b, k, c and f. the 3' end of crta may overlap transcription initiation signals for a downstream gene required for bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis. we have also observed two regions of exceptional amino acid homology between crti and crtd, both of which are dehydrogenases.

TI  == the dna sequence of the rhodobacter capsulatus ntra, ntrb and ntrc gene analogues required for nitrogen fixation.
AB  == we have determined the dna sequence for the genes nifr1, nifr2 and nifr4 in the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus. these genes regulate transcription of the nifhdk operon and so limit the expression of nitrogen fixation activity to periods of low environmental concentrations of both oxygen and fixed nitrogen. the sequences of these three genes are similar to components  of the ntr regulation system in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. the two-component regulatory system of ntrb and ntrc in e. coli is represented by nifr2 and nifr1 in r. capsulatus and nifr4 in r. capsulatus is the equivalent of  the e. coli ntr-related sigma factor ntra.

TI  == ammonia-constitutive nitrogen fixation mutants of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == mutants of r. capsulatus that express nif genes constitutively with respect to ammonia were studied in order to define better the circuit that regulates nif gene transcription. one mutant class could be complemented in trans by a cosmid clone containing a wild-type gene (nifr5) defined by tn5 inserts as being no longer than 1.6 kb. the nifr5 gene is unlinked to previously described nif genes. a second mutant class could not be complemented by the wild-type cosmid library.  for one mutant in this class, a nifh::lac fusion was used to select further mutants that were lac-. only two of these could be complemented in trans to lac+; the complementing gene was nifr4, which is analogous to the ntra gene of enterobacteria. both complemented strains were nifc. therefore these mutations do not bypass the need for the nifr4 gene product. a third class of constitutive mutant was found by selecting nif+ revertants of a nif- strain deleted for the nifr1 and nifr2 genes. the nifr1 and nifr2 genes are homologues of enterobacterial ntrc and ntrb genes, respectively. not all of the nif+ revertants were constitutive; some were regulated normally by ammonia. we suspect that the latter revertants use alternate ntr systems to activate nif gene transcription, a suggestion consistent with the observation that numerous bands in southern blots  of total dna of r. capsulatus are identified by escherichia coli ntr gene probes.

TI  == structure and expression of the puf operon messenger rna in rhodospirillum rubrum.
AB  == in rhodospirillum rubrum, the genes coding for the alpha and beta polypeptides of the b880 antenna (pufa,b) and the l and m polypeptides of the photoreaction center (pufl,m) are clustered on operon puf. in oxygen-limited cells, the puf mrna is present as species of 2561, 640, and 617 nucleotides. aerated cells contain only traces of these mrnas. the large mrna encodes the alpha,beta, l, and m polypeptides, whereas the small mrnas encode only alpha and beta. s1 nuclease protection mapping showed these transcripts to have a common 5' end, immediately  downstream of a region of dyad symmetry and at 166 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon of pufb. the 3' termini of the small transcripts are located in  the intercistronic region between pufa and pufl, downstream of another region of  dyad symmetry. this region is highly conserved in rhodospirillum rubrum, rhodobacter capsulatus, and rhodobacter sphaeroides and shares 61% sequence similarity with the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences of escherichia coli. the slightly heterogeneous 3' termini of the large transcript are downstream of a region of dyad symmetry characteristic of rho-independent transcription termination. following a shift from oxygen-limited to aerated conditions, the pufl,m and the pufa,b mrnas decayed with respective half-lives of 9 and 20 min. these high relative stabilities, attributed to secondary structure, are in accord with the mole ratio (2:1) of the pufa,b/pufl,m messages. while the  differential expression of alpha,beta/l,m congruent to 15 is thought to be due, in part, to this relative stability, the main factor may be a more efficient translation initiation for pufa,b than for pufl,m.

TI  == adaptive response to simple alkylating agents in the phototrophic bacteria rhodobacter capsulatus and r.sphaeroides.
AB  == the presence of an adaptive response to low doses of alkylating chemicals in the  phototrophic bacteria rhodobacter sphaeroides and r.capsulatus has been studied.  results obtained show that both strains display this repair response against the  challenge doses of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng), when they are pretreated with low doses of this compound for 120 min. the adaptive response of  both r.sphaeroides and r.capsulatus induced an increase of cell survival and a decrease of mutagenesis in the mnng-pretreated cells. furthermore, the mnng-induced adaptive repair also gives protection to diethylsulphate and ethylmethanesulphonate in both phototrophic bacteria. finally, the mnng-promoted  adaptive response is sensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis such as chloramphenicol, indicating that this dna repair mechanism needs protein synthesis in r.sphaeroides and r.capsulatus, in a way similar to that which occurs in escherichia coli.
