TI  == a rare case of splenic abscess with septic peritonitis in a german shepherd dog.
AB  == background: splenic abscess is a rare disease with only few reports in small-animal practice as well as in human medicine. it has been mostly reported in immunocompromised patients or following penetrating foreign bodies. this report aims to add to the current veterinary literature on recommended diagnostic tools for splenic abscess, as well as to provide follow-up findings after successful surgical treatment. case presentation: an 8-year-old male german shepherd dog was admitted to the clinic for evaluation of fever, anorexia, and lethargy for the previous 3 days. during the physical examination, a mass was palpated in the left cranioventral abdomen. diagnostic imaging including radiography and ultrasonography revealed the presence of a large mass in the spleen and signs of peritonitis. laboratory tests reflected highly septic pyogranulomatous inflammation and, together with imaging findings, raised a high  suspicion of splenic abscess and septic peritonitis. therapy included complete splenectomy and placement of peritoneal drainage. bacteriological examination revealed severe infection with staphylococcus epidermidis and s. pseudintermedius. histopathological evaluation of the mass confirmed the diagnosis of splenic abscess. conclusion: early diagnosis of splenic abscess in small animals requires a high level of suspicion based on clinical and ultrasonographic findings. immediate surgical intervention is preferable and confirms the diagnosis. total splenectomy remains the most effective therapy. although there are many predisposing factors for splenic abscess, the true etiology remains obscure.

TI  == prevalence and risk factors for isolation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus in dogs with keratitis.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus (mrs) isolation in dogs with naturally acquired bacterial keratitis. procedures: all staphylococcus spp. isolated from corneal samples of dogs with keratitis during a 2-year period were evaluated for  methicillin resistance by bacteriologic methods. each mrs isolate was subjected to in vitro susceptibility testing for systemic and ocular antimicrobials. nasal  swabs for culture were collected from all dogs with mrs corneal isolation to evaluate for nasal carrier status. potential risk factors for mrs isolation were  investigated by medical record review and administration of an epidemiological survey to dog owners. collected information characterizing animal, client, and environmental variables was analyzed for association with mrs isolation. results: seventy-one staphylococcus spp. were isolated from seventy individual dogs with keratitis during the study period. seventeen of the staphylococcus isolates (23.9%) were methicillin resistant. the mrs isolates included staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 10), staphylococcus pseudintermedius (n = 6), and staphylococcus aureus (n = 1). the mrs corneal isolates displayed extensive antimicrobial resistance. four dogs (23.5%) with mrs corneal isolates had positive nasal cultures for mrs. client occupation was significantly (p = 0.01) associated with  mrs isolation, and dogs belonging to owners employed in veterinary or human healthcare fields were four times more likely to have mrs keratitis than dogs owned by clients with different professions. there were no significant associations between the other evaluated animal, client, and environmental factors. conclusions: methicillin resistance is relatively common in staphylococcus isolates from dogs with corneal infections, particularly among dogs belonging to healthcare workers.

TI  == diversity and evolution of oligopeptide permease systems in staphylococcal species.
AB  == several oligopeptide permease (opp) systems have been found in staphylococcal species, including opp1-4, opp3' and the arginine catabolic mobile element (acme)-encoded opp system (acme-opp). they confer upon bacteria the increasing fitness, but their evolutionary histories remain unclear. in this work, we performed a genome-wide identification of opp systems in staphylococcal species.  novel opp systems were identified, including the duplicate of opp4 in staphylococcus pseudintermedius and the acme-opp-like systems in coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). phylogenetic analysis revealed that all  of the identified opp systems were derived from opp3 system by operon duplication during species divergence, while lateral gene transfer might also confer to the dissemination of opp in staphylococci. in addition, we proposed an improved theory on evolution of acme: the opp and arginine-deiminase systems were firstly  transferred from staphylococcus haemolyticus to staphylococcus epidermidis independently; in s. epidermidis they were assembled together and then transferred to staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and characterisation of staphylococci isolated from healthy labrador retrievers in the united kingdom.
AB  == background: coagulase-positive (cops) and coagulase-negative (cons) staphylococci are normal commensals of the skin and mucosa, but are also opportunist pathogens. meticillin-resistant (mr) and multidrug-resistant (mdr) isolates are increasing in human and veterinary healthcare. healthy humans and other animals harbour a variety of staphylococci, including mr-cops and mr-cons. the main aims of the study were to characterise the population and antimicrobial resistance profiles of staphylococci from healthy non-vet visiting and non-antimicrobial treated labrador retrievers in the uk. results: nasal and perineal samples were collected from 73 labrador retrievers; staphylococci isolated and identified using phenotypic and biochemical methods. they were also confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms), pcr  of the nuc gene and pcr and sequencing of the tuf gene. disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) susceptibility tests were determined for a range of antimicrobials. in total, 102 cops (s. pseudintermedius n = 91, s. aureus n = 11) and 334 cons isolates were detected from 99% of dogs in this study. in 52% of dogs cons only were detected, with both cons and cops detected in 43% dogs and cops only detected in 4% of dogs. antimicrobial resistance was not common among cops, but at least one mdr-cons isolate was detected in 34% of dogs. mr-cons were detected from 42% of dogs but no mr-cops were isolated. s. epidermidis (52% of dogs) was the most common cons found followed by s. warneri (30%) and s. equorum (27%), with another 15 cons species isolated from </= 15% of dogs. s. pseudintermedius and s. aureus were detected in 44% and 8% of dogs respectively. conclusions: mr- and mdr-cops were rare. however a high prevalence  of mr- and mdr-cons were found in these dogs, even though they had no prior antimicrobial treatment or admission to veterinary premises. these findings are of concern due to the potential for opportunistic infections, zoonotic transmission and transmission of antimicrobial resistant determinants from these  bacteria to coagulase positive staphylococci.

TI  == a novel microfluidic wound model for testing antimicrobial agents against staphylococcus pseudintermedius biofilms.
AB  == background: current methods for testing treatments for veterinary surgical site infections can successfully emulate elements of a chronic wound, but these are time consuming and costly, requiring specialized laboratory equipment and considerable space to house study animals. microfluidic devices however, can be coated with collagen and maintained at basal body temperature, providing a more cost-effective and space-saving model of a chronic wound. our study assesses the  applicability of a new microfluidic model by testing the activity of dispersinb against biofilms of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius (mrsp); dispersinb has been shown to prevent biofilm growth of staphylococcus epidermidis, another prominent wound colonizer. results: we successfully developed a microfluidic model to examine the effects of antimicrobial therapy on biofilms formed by organisms associated with wound infections in companion animals (e.g. mrsp). although, we were unable to recapitulate previous findings that dispersinb-gentamycin is highly effective against staphylococcal biofilms using this model, we were able to confirm its effect in a microtitre plate. differences in the experimental conditions likely account for this result (e.g. strains tested, flow conditions, treatment time, etc.). in the microtitre plate assay, dispersinb inhibited biofilm growth after a 24 hour period; there was an inverse relationship between the concentration of dispersinb-gentamycin and the amount of biofilm remaining following treatment. collagen-coated microtitre plates showed a similar result, but this did not correlate as well; collagen, the most abundant protein in the body may help to retain the biomass of treated biofilms. conclusions: our model may be useful in examining the effect of treatment on wound infections, although we acknowledge that in this model the test organisms may be more recalcitrant to antimicrobials than in other published systems. we contend that this may in fact better represent the conditions in vivo, where organisms associated with chronic wound infections are highly resistant to antimicrobials.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of dispersinb on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius biofilm.
AB  == methicillin resistant staphylococcus pseudintermedius (mrsp) is an important canine pathogen that has been shown to produce biofilm in vitro. biofilm production may be an important virulence factor and methods to eliminate biofilm-associated infections are required. an enzyme of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dispersinb, has been shown to degrade the extracellular matrix in the biofilm of a variety of bacteria including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the objective of this study was to determine the  effect of dispersinb on mrsp biofilm production and eradication in vitro. a quantitative microtitre plate assay was used to assess the impact of dispersinb on 30 mrsp isolates from dogs. while dispersinb did not have any effect on mrsp growth (p=0.98), it reduced biofilm formation (p=0.0002) and degraded established biofilm (p=0.0001). these data indicate that in vivo study of the effect of this  enzyme in indicated to determine if it may be a useful treatment option for mrsp  biofilm-associated infections.

TI  == reductive evolution and the loss of pdc/pas domains from the genus staphylococcus.
AB  == background: the per-arnt-sim (pas) domain represents a ubiquitous structural fold that is involved in bacterial sensing and adaptation systems, including several virulence related functions. although pas domains and the subclass of phoq-dcus-cita (pdc) domains have a common structure, there is limited amino acid sequence similarity. to gain greater insight into the evolution of pdc/pas domains present in the bacterial kingdom and staphylococci in specific, the pdc/pas domains from the genomic sequences of 48 bacteria, representing 5 phyla,  were identified using the sensitive search method based on hmm-to-hmm comparisons (hhblits). results: a total of 1,007 pas domains and 686 pdc domains distributed  over 1,174 proteins were identified. for 28 gram-positive bacteria, the distribution, organization, and molecular evolution of pdc/pas domains were analyzed in greater detail, with a special emphasis on the genus staphylococcus.  compared to other bacteria the staphylococci have relatively fewer proteins (6-9) containing pdc/pas domains. as a general rule, the staphylococcal genomes examined in this study contain a core group of seven pdc/pas domain-containing proteins consisting of walk, srrb, phor, arls, hsss, nreb, and gdpp. the exceptions to this rule are: 1) s. saprophyticus lacks the core nreb protein; 2)  s. carnosus has two additional pas domain containing proteins; 3) s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and s. pseudintermedius have an additional protein with two pdc domains that is predicted to code for a sensor histidine kinase; 4) s. lugdunensis has an additional pdc containing protein predicted to be a sensor histidine kinase. conclusions: this comprehensive analysis demonstrates that variation in pdc/pas domains among bacteria has limited correlations to the genome size or pathogenicity; however, our analysis established that bacteria having a motile phase in their life cycle have significantly more pdc/pas-containing proteins. in addition, our analysis revealed a tremendous amount of variation in the number of pdc/pas-containing proteins within genera. this variation extended to the staphylococcus genus, which had between 6 and 9 pdc/pas proteins and some of these appear to be previously undescribed signaling  proteins. this latter point is important because most staphylococcal proteins that contain pdc/pas domains regulate virulence factor synthesis or antibiotic resistance.

TI  == inactivation of microorganisms by low-frequency high-power ultrasound: 1. effect  of growth phase and capsule properties of the bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the effects of high-intensity low-frequency (20 khz) ultrasound treatment on the viability of bacteria suspension. more specifically, we have investigated the relationship between the  deactivation efficiency and the physical (size, hydrophobicity) and biological (gram-status, growth phase) properties of the microbes. enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. epidermidis sk and staphylococcus pseudintermedius were chosen for this study owing to their varying physical and biological properties. the survival ratio of the bacteria suspension was measured as a function of the ultrasound power (up to 13 w) for a constant sonication time of 20 min. transmission electron microscopy was used to evaluate  the ultrasound-induced damages to the microbes. ultrasound treatment resulted in  lethal damage to e. aerogenes and b. subtilis (up to 4.5-log reduction), whereas  staphylococcus spp. were not affected noticeably. further, e. aerogenes suspensions were more sensitive to ultrasonication in exponential growth phase than when they were in stationary phase. the results of this study demonstrate that the main reason for bacterial resistance to ultrasonic deactivation is due to the properties of the bacterial capsule. microbes with a thicker and "soft" capsule are highly resistant to ultrasonic deactivation process.

TI  == rapid microarray-based identification of different meca alleles in staphylococci.
AB  == to screen isolates and to identify meca alleles, published meca sequences were analyzed, and a microarray for the rapid discrimination of meca alleles was designed. a genbank analysis yielded 135 full-length gene sequences annotated as  meca. these sequences clustered into 32 different alleles corresponding to 28 unique amino acid sequences and to 15 distinct hybridization patterns on this microarray. a collection of 78 clinical and veterinary isolates of staphylococcus spp. was characterized using this assay. nine of the 15 expected patterns, as well as one as-yet-unknown pattern, were identified. these patterns were detected in various epidemic methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, in s. pseudintermedius, and in coagulase-negative species such as s. epidermidis, s. fleurettii, or s. haemolyticus. there was no correlation between the different meca hybridization patterns and the sccmec type. determination of mics showed that meca alleles corresponding to only four of these nine patterns were associated with beta-lactam resistance. the meca alleles that did not confer beta-lactam resistance were largely restricted to coagulase-negative staphylococci of animal origin, such as s. sciuri and s. vitulinus. because of the diversity of sequences and the different impact on beta-lactam susceptibility, the existence of different meca alleles needs to be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays for the detection of meca.

TI  == genetic and phenotypic characterization of methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated from veterinary hospitals in south korea.
AB  == staphylococci were isolated from veterinary staff, hospitalized animals, and medical equipment from 2 major tertiary veterinary hospitals in south korea to investigate antimicrobial resistance and genetic relatedness. the detection rate  for staphylococci was 55.2% (111/201 samples), and 11 species were identified among the collected staphylococcal strains. the most prevalent species were staphylococcus pseudintermedius (52/111, 46.8%), staphylococcus epidermidis (21/111, 18.9%), and staphylococcus aureus (19/111, 17.1%). the methicillin-resistance rates of staphylococci isolated from veterinary staff and  medical equipment were higher than those from hospitalized animals. the genotype  of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains in the current study was sequence type (st)72-sccmec ivc-t324, which is similar to the genotype of prevalent mrsa strains in human beings and food animals in south korea. among the meca-positive s. pseudintermedius isolates, sccmec v was most prevalent in strains originating from both veterinary staff and hospitalized animals. sccmec iva was detected in methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, whereas sccmec ivc was  found in other methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the sccmec typing, antimicrobial susceptibility tests, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis results showed that methicillin-resistant staphylococci dissemination between hospitalized animals and veterinary staff is possible in south korean veterinary hospitals.

TI  == insertion sequence is256 in canine pyoderma isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius associated with antibiotic resistance.
AB  == staphylococcus pseudintermedius is the most frequent staphylococcal species isolated from canine pyoderma. the control of s. pseudintermedius infection is often difficult due to the expanded antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. antibiotic resistance in staphylococcal pathogens is often associated to mobile genetic elements such as the insertion sequence is256 that was first described as a part of the transposon tn4001, which confers aminoglycoside resistance in staphylococcus aureus and in staphylococcus epidermidis. in this study a collection of 70 s. pseudintermedius isolates from canine pyoderma was used to investigate antimicrobial susceptibility to 15 antibiotics and the presence of is256, not revealed in s. pseudintermedius yet. antibiotic resistance profiling demonstrated that all s. pseudintermedius isolates had a multi-drug resistance phenotype, exhibiting simultaneous resistance to at least five antibiotics; indeed methicillin resistant s. pseudintermedius isolates were simultaneously resistant to at least nine antibiotics and all were also gentamicin resistant. pcr analyses revealed the presence of is256 in 43/70 s. pseudintemedius isolates. the association between the presence of is256 and the resistance was particularly significant for certain antibiotics: cefovecin, amikacin, gentamicin and oxacillin (chi(2)p-value<0.05). however, there was a striking result in frequency of strains resistant to gentamicin and oxacillin, suggesting a specific association between the presence of the is256 element and the determinants for the resistance to these antibiotics. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the detection of is256 in s. pseudintermedius isolates and its association with antibiotic resistance. our findings suggest that s. pseudintermedius may acquire antibiotic resistance genes through mobile genetic elements which may play a predominant role in the dissemination of multi-drug resistance.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial resistance of staphylococci isolated from canine urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study determined the diversity of species and antimicrobial resistance of staphylococci isolated from dogs with a presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection (uti). urine samples from 348 dogs with clinical signs of uti, according to clinical examination and urinalysis, were processed for isolation of staphylococcus. colonies in pure culture were identified by biochemical reactions and tested for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials. seventy isolates of staphylococci were obtained (20.1%). staphylococcus pseudintermedius was the most frequent species (32.8%), followed by s. epidermidis (18.6%), s. simulans (15.7%), s. schleiferi schleiferi (11.4%), s. aureus (11.4%), s. schleiferi coagulans (7.2%) and s. saprophyticus (2.9%). all the isolates were resistant to  at least 1 drug and 77.1% were multiresistant. the study reports the alarming antimicrobial resistance of members of the staphylococcus genus isolated from canine uti and highlights the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci in its etiology.

TI  == species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from canine otitis externa.
AB  == the diversity of species of the genus staphylococcus sp. and the antimicrobial resistance of isolates from 151 unmedicated dogs of both sexes with a clinical diagnosis of otitis were recorded. ninety-one isolates of staphylococcus spp. were identified by biochemical reactions and tested for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials. coagulase-positive species were most common; s. pseudintermedius  (38.4%), s. schleiferi schleiferi (15.4%), s. aureus (14.3%), s. epidermidis (11%), s. simulans (11%), s. schleiferi coagulans (8.8%) and s. saprophyticus (1.1%). all the isolates showed resistance to at least one drug and 89% were multiresistant. amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid and oxacillin were the  most effective, while resistance was widely observed for neomycin and erythromycin. the results highlight the recognition and the potential need for bacterial culture with species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests for appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
