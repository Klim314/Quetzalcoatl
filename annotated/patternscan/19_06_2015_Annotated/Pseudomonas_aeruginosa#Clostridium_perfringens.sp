TI  == characterization, validation and application of a dna microarray for the detection of mandatory and other waterborne pathogens.
AB  == culture methods for the detection of indicator bacteria are currently used for detection of waterborne bacteria. the need for an increased range of analyzed bacteria coupled with the obtainment of rapid and early results justify the development of a dna microarray for the identification of waterborne pathogens. this dna microarray has 16 implanted probes with a median size of 147 bases, targeting 12 different parameters, including all mandatory indicator microorganisms, such as escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, total and fecal coliforms and enterococci. the validation performed with dna extracted from pure microbial cultures showed the suitability of the probes for detection of the target microorganism. to overcome  the high dilution of water samples it was included either a prior culture step of bacterial contaminants retained after filtering 100 ml of water, or a 10-fold increase in the volume of filtered water, that resulted in the increase of the detected bacteria. the analysis of complex environmental water samples using culture methods and the dna microarray revealed that the latter detected the same parameters plus other bacteria tested only in the dna microarray. the results show that this dna microarray may be a useful tool for water microbiological surveillance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == immunotoxin-mediated targeting of claudin-4 inhibits the proliferation of cancer  cells.
AB  == immunotoxins are engineered chimeric proteins that consist of a fragment of a toxin fused to a modified antibody or growth factor capable of targeting specific cells. furthermore, these proteins can be targeted to receptors that are commonly overexpressed on cancer cells. the majority of immunotoxins function by binding to cells, translocating into the cytosol and inhibiting protein synthesis. in this study, the expression of claudin4 (cldn4) in various cancer cells was analysed as a potential target for immunotoxins. to target cldn4-expressing cancer cells, the c-terminal cldn4binding domain of clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (cpe) was fused to the pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a (eta) domain to create an immunotoxin (cpeeta'). subsequently, the capacity of such an immunotoxin in suppressing the proliferation of cldn4-positive cancer cells was investigated. we report that head and neck squamous carcinoma cells (hn5) have an elevated cldn4 expression compared to the other cell lines tested. our findings further demonstrate that cpeeta' is highly potent against mcf-7 breast [50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) 9.8 ng/ml] and hn5 head/neck (ic50 8.8 ng/ml) cancer cell lines, while it has no cytotoxic effects on hela cells (cldn4negative). the immunotoxin was subsequently expressed in the tumour colonising oncolytic strain, clostridium ghonii. most importantly, the strictly anaerobic clostridium ghonii was able to overexpress and secrete a functional cpeeta' fusion protein. our findings open the possibility of the targeted delivery of the immunotoxin locally to tumour sites at a high concentration using strictly anaerobic clostridium ghonii for the treatment of cldn4-positive cancer  cells.

TI  == municipal landfill sites as sources of microorganisms potentially pathogenic to humans.
AB  == the present research was aimed at assessing the quality of air and soil on the premises and in the vicinity of the municipal landfill sites in torun with regard to the presence of pathogenic bacteria, potentially dangerous to humans. air samples (the impaction method using a mas-100 impactor) and soil samples were collected from seven sampling sites including the operating and closed landfill cells, sampling sites located near leachate ponds, and sampling sites located outside the above premises. the research also involved assessing microbial air contamination in three indoor spaces on the premises of the landfill sites. microbial tests involved the determination of the number of culturable mesophilic, mannitol-positive, and alpha- and beta-hemolytic bacteria in the air, determination of the number of coliform bacteria, spore-forming clostridium perfringens in soil, and the presence of salmonella in soil. the results indicate that bioaerosol emitted by this municipal facility is the source of hemolytic bacteria (</= 300 cfu m(-3) of air), as well as of pathogenic bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus subtilis). the highest risk of exposure to biological agents was determined in the sorting facility. over sixty percent of air samples in this sampling site presented high pollution degree with mesophilic bacteria (500-2000 cfu m(-3) of air) and over one fourth of air samples presented very high pollution degree (>2000 cfu m(-3) of air). indoor air in other rooms was considered highly/moderately contaminated (100-2000 cfu m(-3) of air). the highest risk related to the presence of salmonella, clostridium perfringens, and  coliform bacteria in soil was determined at the operating landfill cell and near  the leachate pond of the closed landfill cell. at the operating landfill cell the total coli ranged from 4-1226 mpn g(-1) of dry mass of soil and clostridium perfringens ranged from <lod-1604 cfu g(-1) of dry mass of soil. the results question the strategy of municipal landfill sites in densely populated areas, and emphasize the need for regular monitoring of microbiological tests in their vicinity as well as for control strategies in order to protect workers at landfill sites. the results of the study should be used for future decisions on the location of municipal landfill sites and suggest the need for better environmental control technologies in the sites that are already functioning.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam: a novel cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination.
AB  == avibactam (formerly nxl104, ave1330a) is a synthetic non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits the activities of ambler class a and c beta-lactamases and some ambler class d enzymes. this review summarizes the existing data published for ceftazidime-avibactam, including relevant chemistry,  mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. although not a beta-lactam, the chemical structure of avibactam closely resembles portions of the cephem bicyclic ring system, and avibactam has been shown to bond covalently to beta-lactamases. very little is known about the potential for avibactam to select for resistance. the addition of avibactam greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] reduction) improves the activity of ceftazidime versus most species of enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of beta-lactamase enzyme(s). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of avibactam also improves the activity of ceftazidime (~fourfold mic reduction). limited data suggest that the addition of avibactam does not improve the activity of ceftazidime versus acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp.). the pharmacokinetics of avibactam follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration  of ceftazidime. the maximum plasma drug concentration (c(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) of avibactam increase linearly with doses ranging from 50 mg to 2,000 mg. the mean volume of distribution and half-life of  22 l (~0.3 l/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to ceftazidime. like ceftazidime, avibactam is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. pharmacodynamic data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is rapidly bactericidal versus beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by ceftazidime alone.clinical trials to date have reported that ceftazidime-avibactam is as effective as standard carbapenem therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative isolates. the safety and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam has  been reported in three phase i pharmacokinetic studies and two phase ii clinical  studies. ceftazidime-avibactam appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.in conclusion, avibactam serves to broaden the spectrum of ceftazidime versus ss-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli. the  exact roles for ceftazidime-avibactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. potential future roles for ceftazidime-avibactam include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant gram-negative-bacilli producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl), klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs) and/or ampc ss-lactamases. in addition, ceftazidime-avibactam may be used in combination (with metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial infections. finally, the increased activity of ceftazidime-avibactam versus p. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or documented p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  == the volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the croatian endemic plant centaurea ragusina l. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. the chemical compositions, determined by gc and gc-ms, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. nonterpene hydrocarbons were  also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution  assays. they were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/ml. the volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with mic values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/ml against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the gram-negative bacteria cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (mic  = 32-128 microg/ml).

TI  == opportunistic pathogens and faecal indicators in drinking water associated biofilms in cluj, romania.
AB  == biofouling occurs without exception in all water systems, with undesirable effects such as biocorrosion and deterioration of water quality. drinking water associated biofilms represent a potential risk to human health by harbouring pathogenic or toxin-releasing microorganisms. this is the first study investigating the attached microbiota, with potential threat to human health, in  a public water system in romania. the presence and the seasonal variation of viable faecal indicators and opportunistic pathogens were investigated within naturally developed biofilms in a drinking water treatment plant. bacterial frequencies were correlated with microbial loads in biofilms as well as with physical and chemical characteristics of biofilms and raw water. the biofilms assessed in the current study proved to be extremely active microbial consortia.  high bacterial numbers were recovered by cultivation, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, intestinal enterococci and clostridium perfringens. there were no legionella spp. detected in any biofilm sample. emergence of opportunistic pathogens in biofilms was not significantly affected by the surface material, but by the treatment process. implementation of a water safety plan encompassing measures to prevent microbial contamination and  to control biofouling would be appropriate.

TI  == microbiologic characteristics of pathogenic bacteria from hospitalized trauma patients who survived wenchuan earthquake.
AB  == the purpose of this study is to investigate the microbiological characterization  of pathogenic bacteria isolated from trauma patients after wenchuan earthquake in 2008. most infections were identified in the patients over 60 years of age, with  an incidence rate of 78.5%, and more infections in wound (43.3%) and respiratory  tract (37.1%) sites were identified. a total of 97 non-duplicated clinical pathogens were isolated from 91 trauma patients. of those pathogens, 62 (63.9%) were gram-negative bacilli, 23 (23.7%) were gram-positive cocci, 9 (9.3%) were fungi, and 3 (3.1%) were anaerobes, such as clostridium perfringens. the distribution spectrum of pathogens isolated from trauma patients after earthquake was different to that from non-earthquake trauma patients in our hospital at the  same time. the most prevalent pathogenic isolates were escherichia coli (15.4%),  acinetobacter baumannii (14.4%), staphylococcus aureus (12.3%), burkholderia cepacia (11.3%), and enterococcus spp. (9.3%). the drug susceptibility results showed that most of the gram-negative bacilli, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa  and burkholderia cepacia, were susceptible to imipenem, but resistant to the first- and the second-generation cephalosporins. most of the gram-positive cocci  were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and synercid/dalfopristin. characteristics of pathogenic bacterium isolated from trauma patients after earthquake have been demonstrated which play an important role in the appropriate treatment of infections.

TI  == survival trends of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and clostridium perfringens in a sandy south florida beach.
AB  == the search for alternative indicators of disease-risk from non-enteric pathogens  at the beach revealed high densities of targeted bacteria. to explain the high numbers of potential non-enteric pathogens, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in beach sand, we investigated factors affecting their survival and distribution, as well as those of a potential fecal indicator, clostridium perfringens. results indicated greater s. aureus and p. aeruginosa survival and proliferation in sterile beach sand, than seawater, with diminished numbers upon  exposure to natural micro-predators. c. perfringens remained relatively consistent with initial numbers. intermediate sand particles (850 mum-2 mm) constituted the major micro-niche; creating implications for beach classification programs. colonization of sterile sand boxes at the beach by s. aureus and p. aeruginosa confirmed the filtering action (>100x) of beach sand. the use of these potential pathogens in periodic sanitary evaluation of beach sand quality is indicated, regardless of the factors influencing their abundance.

TI  == development and application of a polymicrobial, in vitro, wound biofilm model.
AB  == aims: the goal of this investigation was to develop an in vitro, polymicrobial, wound biofilm capable of supporting the growth of bacteria with variable oxygen requirements. methods and results: the strict anaerobe clostridium perfringens was isolated by cultivating wound homogenates using the drip-flow reactor (dfr),  and a three-species biofilm model was established using methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa and cl. perfringens in the colony-drip-flow reactor model. plate counts revealed that mrsa, ps. aeruginosa and cl. perfringens grew to 7.39 +/- 0.45, 10.22 +/- 0.22 and 7.13 +/- 0.77 log cfu per membrane, respectively. the three-species model was employed to evaluate  the efficacy of two antimicrobial dressings, curity amd and acticoat, compared to sterile gauze controls. microbial growth on curity amd and gauze was not significantly different, for any species, whereas acticoat was found to significantly reduce growth for all three species. conclusions: using the colony-dfr, a three-species biofilm was successfully grown, and the biofilms displayed a unique structure consisting of distinct layers that appeared to be inhabited exclusively or predominantly by a single species. significance and impact of the study: the primary accomplishment of this study was the isolation and growth of an obligate anaerobe in an in vitro model without establishing an artificially anaerobic environment.

TI  == bacteria and their toxins tamed for immunotherapy.
AB  == bacterial toxins share the ability to enter host cells to target various intracellular proteins and to modulate host immune responses. over the last 20 years, toxins and their mutated variants, as well as live attenuated bacteria, have been exploited for vaccination and immunotherapy of various infectious, malignant and autoimmune diseases. the ability of bordetella pertussis adenylate  cyclase toxin to translocate its adenylate cyclase domain across the host cell membrane, as well as the pathways of intracellular trafficking of bacillus anthracis lethal and edema toxins, shigella dysenteriae shiga toxin or escherichia coli shiga-like toxin, have been repeatedly exploited for the delivery of antigenic epitopes into host cells and for stimulation of antigen-specific t cell responses. similarly, e. coli alpha-hemolysin, or effector proteins of yersinia and salmonella secreted by the type iii secretion systems, were used to facilitate the delivery of fused heterologous proteins or peptides for antigenic presentation. vibrio cholerae cholera toxin, e. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, b. pertussis pertussis toxin or the cry1a protein of bacillus thuringiensis have shown a great potential to act as adjuvants and to stimulate mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. the immunotherapeutic potential of some toxins, like clostridium perfringens perfringolysin o, streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin, or streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin needs to be evaluated further. the bordetella adenylate cyclase toxoid used as a  vaccine delivery tool, or corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin and pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a-based immunotoxins, are currently in various phases of clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy, as are some antigen-delivering salmonella and listeria monocytogenes strains.

TI  == physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in greece and its public health implications.
AB  == ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. to evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100  ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of epirus were  studied. the following microbiological parameters were determined: total coliforms, fecal coliforms, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia spp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., vibrio cholerae, aeromonas spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens. e. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. aeromonas spp., shigella spp., campylobacter sp. and v. cholerae were not detected. spore forms of c. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's p. aeruginosa and yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. the presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. in view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.

AB  == background: early detection of mixed aerobic-anaerobic infection has been a challenge in clinical practice due to the phenotypic changes in complex environments. surface plasmon resonance (spr) biosensor is widely used to detect  dna-dna interaction and offers a sensitive and label-free approach in dna research. methods: in this study, we developed a single-stranded dna (ssdna) amplification technique and modified the traditional spr detection system for rapid and simultaneous detection of mixed infections of four pathogenic microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium tetani and clostridium perfringens). results: we constructed the circulation detection well to increase the sensitivity and the tandem probe arrays to reduce the non-specific hybridization. the use of 16s rdna universal primers ensured the amplification of four target nucleic acid sequences simultaneously, and further electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the high efficiency of this amplification method. no significant signals were detected during the single-base mismatch or non-specific probe hybridization (p < 0.05). the calibration curves of amplification products of four bacteria had good linearity from 0.1 nm to 100  nm, with all r(2) values of >0.99. the lowest detection limits were 0.03 nm for p. aeruginosa, 0.02 nm for s. aureus, 0.01 nm for c. tetani and 0.02 nm for c. perfringens. the spr biosensor had the same detection rate as the traditional culture method (p < 0.05). in addition, the quantification of pcr products can be completed within 15 min, and excellent regeneration greatly reduces the cost for  detection. conclusions: our method can rapidly and accurately identify the mixed  aerobic-anaerobic infection, providing a reliable alternative to bacterial culture for rapid bacteria detection.

TI  == expression of a clostridium perfringens type iv pilin by neisseria gonorrhoeae mediates adherence to muscle cells.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium that causes a range of diseases in humans, including lethal gas gangrene. we have recently shown that strains of c. perfringens move across the surface of agar plates by a  unique type iv pilus (tfp)-mediated social motility that had not been previously  described. based on sequence homology to pilins in gram-negative bacteria, c. perfringens appears to have two pilin subunits, pila1 and pila2. structural prediction analysis indicated pila1 is similar to the pseudopilin found in klebsiella oxytoca, while pila2 is more similar to true pilins found in the gram-negative pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and neisseria gonorrhoeae. strains of n. gonorrhoeae that were genetically deficient in the native pilin, pile, but  supplemented with inducible expression of pila1 and pila2 of c. perfringens were  constructed. genetic competence, wild-type twitching motility, and attachment to  human urogenital epithelial cells were not restored by expression of either pilin. however, attachment to mouse and rat myoblast (muscle) cell lines was observed with the n. gonorrhoeae strain expressing pila2. significantly, wild-type c. perfringens cells adhered to mouse myoblasts under anaerobic conditions, and adherence was 10-fold lower in a pilt mutant that lacked functional tfp. these findings implicate c. perfringens tfp in the ability of c.  perfringens to adhere to and move along muscle fibers in vivo, which may provide  a therapeutic approach to limiting this rapidly spreading and highly lethal infection.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the enniatin b, produced by fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on caco-2 cells.
AB  == the enniatins (ens) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of fusarium sp. the en b was purified from extracts of fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (pdb), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (lc) followed by an analytical lc.  the purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (esi-ms) study. the pure fraction of en b was utilized to determine  the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally  pathogens of the intestinal tract: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, salmonella enterica, shigella dysenteriae, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. the results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, en b induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms  tested and no significant differences over control were detected when caco-2 cells were exposed to en b, at any of the concentrations used.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis virulence regulator fsra binding to target promoters.
AB  == the fsrabdc signal transduction system is a major virulence regulator in enterococcus faecalis. the fsrc sensor histidine kinase, upon activation by the gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (gbap) peptide encoded by the fsrbd  genes, phosphorylates the fsra response regulator required for the transcription  of the fsrbdc and the gele-spre genes from the fsrb promoter and the gele promoter, respectively. fsra belongs to the lyttr family of proteins, which includes other virulence regulators, such as agra of staphylococcus aureus, algr  of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and virr of clostridium perfringens. the lyttr dna-binding domain that characterizes these proteins generally binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by a number of bases that place the repeats on the same face of the dna helix. in this study, we demonstrated that fsra also binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by 13 bp, based on the consensus  sequence of fsra, t/at/caa/gggaa/g, which is consistent with the binding characteristics of lyttr domains.

TI  == turn a diarrhoea toxin into a receptor-mediated therapy for a plethora of cldn-4-overexpressing cancers.
AB  == molecular targeted therapy (mtt) represents the new generation of anti-cancer arsenals. in this study, we report an alternative approach using a hybrid toxin that utilises the high-affinity of receptor-binding fragment of clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (cpe). cpe naturally binds to cldn-4 through the c-terminal 30 amino acid. however, recent studies have shown that cldn-4 is also  overexpressed on a range of cancer cells. we thus constructed a cdna comprising c-cpe and a well characterised toxic domain of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin a  (c-cpe-eta'). the recombinant c-cpe-eta' fusion protein was shown to retain the specificity of binding to cldn-4 and initiating rapid penetration into cytosol in five different cldn-4 positive cancer cells (breast-mcf7, skin-a431, colon-sw480, prostate-pc3 and du145) but not to cldn-4 negative cells (hela, huvec). c-cpe-eta' was strongly cytotoxic towards cldn-4 positive cancer cell, as opposed to cells lacking cldn-4 expression. furthermore, we demonstrated that the recombinant fusion protein had significant anti-cancer ability in cldn-4 positive cancer models in vivo. subcutaneously implanted mcf7 and sw480 xenograft tumours  were significantly decreased or abolished after three repeated injection of the hybrid toxin. taken together, our results convincingly show that the hybrid toxin targets cldn-4 positive cancer through receptor-binding, and causes significant tumour cell apoptosis, suggesting its potential as an alternative molecular targeted therapy against a plethora of cldn-4 positive cancers.

TI  == standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, pvp-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  == background: this study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics pvp-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and  polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. methods: mics and mbcs were determined in accordance with din 58940-7 and 58940-8 using staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus), streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, haemophilus influenzae and candida albicans. the microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with din en 1040 and 1275 using s. aureus,  p. aeruginosa and c. albicans. results: for chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, mic(48) and mbc(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/l. maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/l, with an efficacy gap against p. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of pvp-iodine were 1024 mg/l, with a gap against s. pneumoniae. comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. after 1 min, only octenidine and pvp-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. conclusions: tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. when a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine >  chlorhexidine > triclosan > pvp-iodine. this is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. if an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = pvp-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.

TI  == role of host cell polarity and leading edge properties in pseudomonas type iii secretion.
AB  == type iii secretion (t3s) functions in establishing infections in a large number of gram-negative bacteria, yet little is known about how host cell properties might function in this process. we used the opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa and the ability to alter host cell sensitivity to pseudomonas t3s to explore this problem. ht-29 epithelial cells were used to study cellular changes  associated with loss of t3s sensitivity, which could be induced by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or perfringolysin o. hl-60 promyelocytic cells are innately resistant to pseudomonas t3s and were used to study cellular changes occurring in response to induction of t3s sensitivity, which occurred following treatment with phorbol esters. using both cell models, a positive correlation was observed between eukaryotic cell adherence to tissue culture wells and t3s sensitivity. in examining the type of adhesion process linked to t3s sensitivity  in ht-29 cells, a hierarchical order of protein involvement was identified that paralleled the architecture of leading edge (le) focal complexes. conversely, in  hl-60 cells, induction of t3s sensitivity coincided with the onset of le properties and the development of actin-rich projections associated with polarized cell migration. when le architecture was examined by immunofluorescent  staining for actin, rac1, iq-motif-containing gtpase-activating protein 1 (iqgap1) and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (pi3 kinase), intact le structure was  found to closely correlate with host cell sensitivity to p. aeruginosa t3s. our model for host cell involvement in pseudomonas t3s proposes that cortical actin polymerization at the le alters membrane properties to favour t3s translocon function and the establishment of infections, which is consistent with pseudomonas infections targeting wounded epithelial barriers undergoing cell migration.

TI  == a novel tumor-targeted therapy using a claudin-4-targeting molecule.
AB  == carcinogenesis is often accompanied by dysfunctional tight junction (tjs), resulting in the loss of cellular polarity. claudin, a tetra-transmembrane protein, plays a pivotal role in the barrier and fence functions of tjs. claudin-4 is deregulated in various cancers, including breast, prostate, ovarian, and gastric cancer. claudin-4 may be a promising target molecule for tumor therapy, but the claudin-targeting strategy has never been fully developed. in the present study, we prepared a claudin-4-targeting molecule by fusion of the c-terminal fragment of clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (c-cpe) with the protein synthesis inhibitory factor (psif) derived from pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin. psif was not cytotoxic to claudin-4-expressing cells, whereas c-cpe-psif was cytotoxic. cells that express claudin-1, -2, and -5 were less sensitive to c-cpe-psif. pretreatment of the cells with c-cpe attenuated c-cpe-psif-induced cytotoxicity, and mutation of c-cpe in the claudin-4-binding residues attenuated the cytotoxicity of c-cpe-psif. tj-undeveloped cells were more sensitive to c-cpe-psif than tj-developed cells. it is noteworthy that polarized epithelial cells are sensitive to c-cpe-psif applied to the basal side, whereas the cells were less sensitive to c-cpe-psif applied to the apical side. intratumoral injection of c-cpe-psif reduced tumor growth. this is the first report to indicate that a claudin-4-targeting strategy may be a promising method  to overcome the malignant tumors.

TI  == ribosome protection prevents azithromycin-mediated quorum-sensing modulation and  stationary-phase killing of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == in pseudomonas aeruginosa, azithromycin has been shown to reduce virulence factor production, to retard biofilm formation, and to exhibit bactericidal effects on stationary-phase cells. in this study we analyzed whether these azithromycin-mediated effects require interaction with the ribosome. we blocked the access of azithromycin to the ribosome in p. aeruginosa pao1 by expressing the 23s rrna methylase ermbp from clostridium perfringens. ribosome protection prevented the azithromycin-mediated reduction of elastase and rhamnolipid production, as well as the inhibition of swarming motility. ribosome protection also prevented the killing of stationary-phase cells, suggesting that the cell-killing effect of azithromycin does not result solely from membrane destabilization. we further show that rhamnolipids are involved in cell killing,  probably by increasing the uptake of the hydrophobic azithromycin molecule. these results have important implications for the treatment with azithromycin of patients chronically colonized by p. aeruginosa and might explain the variability in the efficacy of azithromycin treatments.

TI  == nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dnks). methods: several fda-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. we identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. these genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dnk-deficient e. coli strain to various analogues. we overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from s. enterica and b. cereus. results: the tested gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microm except for a single e. coli isolate and two pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested azt concentrations. purified recombinant s. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated azt efficiently with a km of 73.3 microm and k(cat)/km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) m(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microm. the b. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microm and k(cat)/km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) m(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. s. enterica and b. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dnk enzymes. conclusions: bacterial dnks efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.

TI  == the effect of multifunctional polymer-based gels on wound healing in full thickness bacteria-contaminated mouse skin wound models.
AB  == we determined whether a two-part space-conforming polyethylene glycol/dopa polymer-based gel promoted healing of contaminated wounds in mice. this silver-catalysed gel was previously developed to be broadly microbiocidal in vitro while being biocompatible with human wound cell functioning. full-thickness wounds were created on the backs of mice. the wounds were inoculated with 10(4) cfu of each of four common skin wound contaminants, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii and clostridium perfringens. the wounds were then treated with our multifunctional polymer-based gel, the commercially available newskin product, or left to heal untreated. the untreated  wounds were overtly infected, and presented detectable bacterial loads over the entire 21-day healing period, while the gel and newskin groups presented significantly smaller rises in bacterial levels and were cleared of detectable colonies by the third week, with the gel group clearing the bacteria earlier. while all three groups healed their wounds, the polymer-based gel-treated group demonstrated significantly earlier re-epithelialization and dermal maturation (p<0.05). this was reflected in a quick regain of tensile strength. this accelerated dermal maturation and regain in strength was noted in mice treated with the polymer-based gel when compared to wound treated with the commercially available aquacel-ag dressing (p<0.05). what distinguishes the polymer-based gel  from these other products is that it is incorporated within the healing wound. these preclinical studies show that the anti-microbial polymer gel not only supports but also accelerates healing of bacterially contaminated wounds.

TI  == sensitive quantitative detection of commensal bacteria by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == a sensitive rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) method was developed for exact and sensitive enumeration of subdominant bacterial populations. using group- or species-specific primers for 16s or 23s rrna, analytical curves were constructed for escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the threshold cycle value was found to be linear up to an rna amount of 10(-3) cell per rt-pcr. the number of bacteria in culture was determined by rt-qpcr, and the results correlated well with the cfu count over the range from 10(0) to 10(5) cfu. the bacterial counts obtained by rt-qpcr were the same as the cfu counts irrespective of the growth phase in vitro, except for c. perfringens during starvation periods; the viable cell counts obtained by using a combination of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) staining and syto9-propidium iodide double staining were in good agreement with the rt-qpcr counts rather than with the cfu  counts. the rt-qpcr method could detect endogenous enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa in feces of hospitalized patients (n = 38) at a level of 10(3) cells per g of feces, and for enumeration of s. aureus or p. aeruginosa spiked into human peripheral blood, the lower detection limit for rt-qpcr quantification of the bacteria was 2 cells per ml of blood, suggesting that this method was equivalent to the conventional culture method. as only 5 h was needed for rt-qpcr quantification, we suggest that rrna-targeted rt-qpcr assays provide a sensitive  and convenient system for quantification of commensal bacteria and for examining  their possible invasion of a host.

AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == in vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  == ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. ertapenem is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. it has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. mic(90)s for most species of enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/l, significantly lower than those of imipenem. mic(90)s for most bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/l, and mic(90)s were species specific for clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/l for clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/l for clostridium clostridioforme. ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus). ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in gram-negative organisms.

TI  == distribution of potential type ii restriction sites (palindromes) in prokaryotes.
AB  == restriction-modification systems are used as a defensive mechanism against inappropriate invasion of foreign dna. the recognition sequences for the common type ii restriction enzymes and their corresponding methylases are usually palindromes. in this study, we identified the most over- and underrepresented words in dna of four bacteria: escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. using maximum order markov chain analysis, we found that palindromic words were most often more underrepresented than their non-palindromic counterparts. no strict rule for the intragenic palindrome content could be derived, but for three of the bacteria there was a weak correlation between codon usage bias and palindrome content. a clear drop in palindrome counts was observed in the shine-dalgarno region for b. subtilis and c. perfringens, but not in e. coli or p. aeruginosa. it was also shown that palindromes in eubacteria and archaebacteria seem to occur slightly more infrequently than expected on the basis of the genomic gc-content, but some exceptions to this principle exist.

TI  == identification of species of brucella using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) is a technique that has been used  over the years in chemical analysis for the identification of substances and is one that may be applied to the characterisation of microorganisms. the marked tendency of brucella towards variation in the smooth rough phase, together with the laboriousness and risk involved in the methods used in their identification,  make their classification difficult. we studied the type strains of the different species and biovars of brucella and 11 isolates of human origin of brucella melitensis, six corresponding to biovar 1, one to biovar 2 and five to biovar 3.  the results of linear discriminant analysis performed using the data provide an above 95% likelihood of correct classification, over half of which are in fact above 99% for the vast majority of brucella strains. only one case of b. melitensis biovar 1 has been incorrectly classified. the rest of the microorganisms studied (staphylococcus aureus, strteptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been classified correctly in all cases to a likelihood of over 80%. in the graphic representation of the analysis, a grouping of these can be seen in clusters, which include the different species. one of these comprises b.  melitensis, another brucella abortus, and another wider one is made up of brucella suis. the brucella canis, brucella ovis and brucella neotomae strains appear separate from the previously described groups.

TI  == duplication is more common among laterally transferred genes than among indigenous genes.
AB  == background: recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. results: it is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. furthermore, the gc3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. conclusions: the results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. the importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.

TI  == analysis of nucleotide distribution in the genome of streptomyces coelicolor a3(2) using the z curve method.
AB  == the nucleotide distribution of all 33,527 open reading frames (orfs) (> or =300 bp) in the genome of streptomyces coelicolor a3(2) has been analyzed using the z  curve method. each orf is mapped onto a point in a 9-dimensional space. to visualize the distribution of mapping points, the points are projected onto the principal plane based on principal component analysis. consequently, the distribution pattern of the 33,527 points in the principal plane shows a flower-like shape, in which there are seven distinct regions. in addition to the  central region, there are six petal-like regions around the center, one of which  corresponds to 7172 coding sequences. the central region and the remaining five petal-like regions correspond to the intergenic sequences and out-of-frame non-coding orfs, respectively. it is shown that selective pressure produces a remarkable bias of the g+c content among three codon positions, resulting in the  interesting phenomenon observed. a similar phenomenon is also observed for other  bacterial genomes with high genomic g+c content, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa pa01 (g+c = 66.6%). however, for the genomes of bacillus subtilis (g+c = 43.5%) and clostridium perfringens (g+c = 28.6%), no similar phenomenon was observed. the finding presented here may be useful to improve the gene-finding algorithms for genomes with high g+c content. a set of supplementary materials including the plots displaying the base distribution patterns of orfs in 12 prokaryotes is provided on the website http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/highgc/.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == a novel type of conserved dna-binding domain in the transcriptional regulators of the algr/agra/lytr family.
AB  == sequence analysis of bacterial genomes revealed a novel dna-binding domain. this  domain is found in several response regulators of the two-component signal transduction system, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa algr, involved in the regulation of alginate biosynthesis and in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis; clostridium perfringens virr, a regulator of virulence factors, and in several regulators of bacteriocin biosynthesis, previously unified in the agra/come family. most of the transcriptional regulators that contain this dna-binding domain are involved in biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, fimbriation, expression of exoproteins, including toxins, and quorum sensing. we  refer to it as the lyttr ('litter') domain, after bacillus subtilis lytt and staphylococcus aureus lytr response regulators, involved in regulation of cell autolysis. in addition to response regulators, the lyttr domain is found in combination with mhyt, pas and other sensor domains.

AB  == since at least wwii, some open, contaminated wounds involving massive soft tissue injury and vascular damage have resulted in "irreversible shock," despite prompt  rescue, hemorrhage control, and blood and fluid replacement, without signs of clinical infection. in animal studies, survival time was related statistically to the dosage of clostridium perfringens in multicontaminated explosive wounds. survival time was lengthened by the application of some topical antibacterial agents, but actual recovery was achieved only with topical mafenide hydrochloride solution aqueous spray, which resulted in negative clostridium. perfringens cultures. although not related statistically to survival time, the mafenide hydrochloride spray also controlled the pseudomonas aeruginosa in these wounds. mafenide hydrochloride had the american trade name of sulfamylon from about 1942  until 1998, when another pharmaceutical company patented sulfamylon as the trade  name for mafenide acetate, a weaker antibacterial agent. however, mafenide hydrochloride still is available from chemical companies. mafenide hydrochloride  solution spray has been used successfully in treatment of patients with severe by contaminated wounds and deep burns, and its use in initial care should be revisited.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == detection of phospholipase c in nontuberculous mycobacteria and its possible role in hemolytic activity.
AB  == phospholipase c plays a key role in the pathogenesis of several bacterial infections, for example, those caused by clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes. previous studies have reported multiple copies of plc genes homologous to pseudomonas aeruginosa plch and plcn genes encoding the hemolytic and nonhemolytic phospholipase c enzymes in the genomes of mycobacterium tuberculosis, m. marinum, m. bovis, and m. ulcerans. in this study we analyzed the possible relationship between phospholipase c and hemolytic activity in 21 strains of nontuberculous mycobacteria representing nine different species. detection of phospholipase c enzymatic activity was carried out using thin-layer  chromatography to detect diglycerides in the hydrolysates of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine. dna sequences of m. kansasii and m. marinum homologous to the genes encoding phospholipase c from m. tuberculosis and m. ulcerans were identified by dna-dna hybridization and sequencing. finally, we developed a direct and simple assay to detect mycobacterial hemolytic activity. this assay is based on a modified blood agar medium that allows the growth and expression of hemolysis of slow-growing mycobacteria. hemolytic activity was detected in m. avium, m. intracellulare, m. ulcerans, m. marinum, m. tuberculosis, and m. kansasii mycobacteria with phospholipase c activity, but not in m. fortuitum. no  hemolytic activity was detected in m. smegmatis, m. gordonae, and m. vaccae. whether or not phospholipase c enzyme plays a role in the pathogenesis of nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases needs further investigation.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. mics of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. the activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (mic50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/l) than previously reported for ofloxacin. as seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and  pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (mic 1-8 mg/l). mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/l. levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; mic 0.06-0.25 mg/l), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; mic 1-32 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (mics 0.016-0.03 mg/l, 0.03-0.12 mg/l) and 0.03-0.12 mg/l, respectively). clostridium perfringens (n = 23; mic 0.25-1 mg/l) was more susceptible than bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; mic 0.5-4 mg/l). levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci (n = 107; mic 0.03-0.5 mg/l); the resistant strains (mics 2-32 mg/l) were usually also resistant to methicillin. levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; mic 1-32 mg/l), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (mics 0.5-2 mg/l). according to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for mics of 1, 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. in conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin  compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.

TI  == evaluation of microbial hazards during processing of spanish prepared flamenquin.
AB  == flamenquin is a traditional, prepared, frozen meat product from the south of spain made with minced pork, chicken, and cooked ham. since it is a prepared raw  meat product some microbial hazards could be associated with the process of making it. microbiological analyses have been performed throughout the various steps of processing over a 1-year period to evaluate microbial hazards in the commercial process. high levels of microorganisms were observed all through the processing of this product, the mincing and mixing steps being where major microbial contamination was observed. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus  aureus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected during processing. raw materials and food handlers were the principal sources of microbial contamination. a modification of processing to include a heating step after mincing and mixing and an improvement in hygiene practices could eliminate the microbial hazards. both modifications should be noted for the implementation of a hazard analysis of critical control points (haccp) program in commercial flamenquin processing.

TI  == bacterial phospholipases and their role in virulence.
AB  == virulence of many bacterial pathogens is based, at least in part, on the action of phospholipases. the consequences may be immediate and direct, as in the action of clostridium perfringens alpha toxin on red cells or platelets, or subtle, as with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases of listeria monocytogenes and other bacteria.

TI  == role of hemolytic and nonhemolytic phospholipase c from pseudomonas aeruginosa for inflammatory mediator release from human granulocytes.
AB  == background: pseudomonas aeruginosa phospholipase c (plc) is a critical component  in the pathogenesis of severe p. aeruginosa infections. however, p. aeruginosa can produce a hemolytic (plc-h) as well as a nonhemolytic (plc-n) variant, both having a mw of about 77 kd. in the past, studies did not distinguish between both types of plc with regard to the induction of inflammatory mediators from human cells. methods: we compared the ability of p. aeruginosa plc-h and plc-n to generate leukotriene b4 (by hplc) and oxygen (o2-) metabolites (luminol-enhanced  chemiluminescence), and to release beta-glucuronidase and histamine (fluorophotometry from human granulocytes. therefore, human neutrophilic granulocytes (pmn; 1 x 10(7)) or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (5 x 10(6)) were treated with purified p. aeruginosa plc-h (up to 10 units) as well as culture supernatants (cutoff: mw > 50,000) of p. aeruginosa paol capable of producing both plc-h and plc-n, and paol mutant strains deficient in the production of either or both phospholipases. controls were plc-h from clostridium perfringens and plc-n from bacillus cereus. results: plc-h-containing p. aeruginosa culture supernatant, purified p. aeruginosa plc-h as well as plc-h from p. perfringens activated human leukocytes for a significant (p < 0.05) increase in inflammatory mediator release. in this regard, purified plc-h (10 units) from p. aeruginosa activated human pmn for a significant increase in the generation of oxygen metabolites (30 +/- 5.4 x 10(3) cpm) and in leukotriene b4 (6.1 +/- 2.0 ng), in the release of beta-glucuronidase (15.8 +/- 1.1%) and of histamine (25.8 +/- 6.2%) as compared to the corresponding control values (3 +/-  1 x 10(3) cpm; 0.2 +/- 0.1 ng; 5.1 +/- 1.0%, 5.1 +/- 1.5%). culture supernatants  containing no plc or only plc-n, as well as plc-n from b. cereus, failed to activate or only slightly stimulated human granulocytes for inflammatory mediator release. conclusion: the data thus provide evidence that p. aeruginosa plc-h can  be a potent inducer of inflammatory mediator release, at least in vitro. our results therefore contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological role  of p. aeruginosa plcs.

TI  == collagenase gene (cola) is located in the 3'-flanking region of the perfringolysin o (pfoa) locus in clostridium perfringens.
AB  == the 3'-flanking region of the beta-galactosidase gene (pbg), which is located downstream of the perfringolysin o gene (pfoa), and the 5'-flanking region of the collagenase gene (cola) of clostridium perfringens strains nctc8237 and 13, respectively, were analyzed. southern analysis revealed that the cola gene is located 6.5 kb downstream of the pbg gene in the chromosome of c. perfringens. sequence analysis showed that between the pbg and cola genes were the arcabdc and ahrc genes, whose putative products were quite similar to enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway of pseudomonas aeruginosa and the arginine repressor/activator  of bacillus subtilis, respectively. it is concluded that the genomic structure of the pfoa-cola region consists of pfor-pfoa-orf54-pbg-arcabdc-ahrc-cola.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared to nine other antimicrobial agents: importance of its stability when used in agar dilution systems.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem was tested against 426 clinical isolates  representing a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic species. the in vitro activity of meropenem was compared with that of iminpenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and tobramycin against aerobic isolates, and also compared with that of imipenem, metronidazole, cefoxitin, clindamycin and piperacillin against the anaerobic isolates. meropenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against gram negative aerobes, anaerobes, gram positive anaerobes and most of the gram positive aerobes. the mic90 of meropenem against the enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.03 mg/l to 0.125 mg/l. meropenem was very active against extended spectrum beta lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae, most acinetobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium difficile (mic90 of 1.0 mg/l), clostridium perfringens and other clostridium species. even though imipenem exhibited better  activity against the coagulase negative staphylococci, meropenem still had mic's  which were less than the break point (8.0 mg/l). the stability of meropenem in agar was determined indirectly by plotting the geometric mean mic of control strains over a period of two weeks. mean mic of six control strains for meropenem was 0.05 mg/l and remained constant over 10 days, whereas the mean mic of imipenem rose to 0.24 mg/l after two days and to 3.4 mg/l after 10 days. meropenem was therefore far more stable in agar than imipenem. this has implications for laboratories using agar dilution as it requires less frequent plate preparation and decreased labour costs.

TI  == management of intra-abdominal infections. the case for intraoperative cultures and comprehensive broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. the canadian intra-abdominal infection study group.
AB  == objective: to test the hypothesis that comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy is superior to limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy in intra-abdominal infections. design: prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. setting: university-affiliated hospitals in canada. patients: two hundred thirteen patients with intra-abdominal infections and planned operative or percutaneous drainage. intervention: limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoxitin sodium, 2 g, intravenously, every 6 hours (n = 109). comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy consisted of a combination of imipenem and cilastatin sodium, 500 mg, intravenously, every 6 hours (n = 104). main outcome measures: failure to cure the intra-abdominal infection (persistence of infection or death). results: of initial isolates, 98% were sensitive to imipenem plus cilastin sodium compared with 72% for cefoxitin. no difference was found in the failure rate between treatment groups. among various reasons for failure (including technical), 12 of 80 patients in the limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group had resistant organisms at a second intervention compared with 1 of 74 in the comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group (p < .003, chi 2). one death in the limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group was due to autopsy-proved disseminated pseudomonas aeruginosa (blood, peritoneum, lung, and pleural fluid) that was resistant to cefoxitin, and the other was associated with peritonitis due to cefoxitin-resistant enterobacter cloacae. one death in the comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group was associated with peritonitis from clostridium perfringens that was sensitive to imipenem plus cilastin sodium, and the other was associated with peritonitis from pseudomonas aeruginosa that was resistant to imipenem plus cilastin sodium. conclusion: treatment failure of intra-abdominal infection may be due, in part, to the presence of resistant pathogens at the site of infection. therefore, routine culture of these sites seems worthwhile and empirical therapy should be as comprehensive as possible and should cover all potential pathogens.

TI  == improved immobilization of dna to microwell plates for dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == an improved and simplified protocol for dna immobilization was developed to enhance dna-dna hybridization on microwell plates. target dna was immobilized by  simple dry-adsorption. efficiencies of dna immobilization and retention were enhanced 1.4-6.5 times and 4.2-19.6 times, respectively, compared with a conventional method. the overall hybridization efficiency was increased 3.1-5.2 times. this simple new protocol can reduce the consumption of scarce dna samples.

TI  == role of pseudomonas aeruginosa lipase in inflammatory mediator release from human inflammatory effector cells (platelets, granulocytes, and monocytes.
AB  == previously, we have shown that pseudomonas aeruginosa lipase and phospholipase c  (plc), two extracellular lipolytic enzymes, interact with each other during 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (hete) generation from human platelets. in this regard. the addition of purified p. aeruginosa lipase to plc-containing crude p.  aeruginosa culture supernatants enhances the generation of the chemotactically active 12-hete from human platelets. therefore, we analyzed the interaction of purified p. aeruginosa lipase and purified hemolytic p. aeruginosa plc with regard to inflammatory mediator release from human platelets, neutrophilic and basophilic granulocytes, and monocytes. purified p. aeruginosa plc, but not purified lipase by itself, induced 12-hete generation from human platelets, the generation of leukotriene b4 (ltb4) and oxygen metabolites, enzyme release from human neutrophils, and histamine release from basophils but diminished interleukin-8 (il-8) release from human monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. the addition of purified lipase enhanced plc-induced 12-hete and ltb4 generation, did not influence enzyme, histamine, or il-8 release, but diminished the plc-induced  chemiluminescent response. similar results were obtained when the hemolytic plc from clostridium perfringens was used instead of p. aeruginosa plc. for further comparison, we used the well-defined calcium ionophore a23187 and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (pma) as stimuli. lipase enhanced calcium ionophore-induced ltb4 generation and beta-glucuronidase release but reduced calcium ionophore-induced and pma-induced chemiluminescence. in parallel, we analyzed the role of lipase in a crude p. aeruginosa culture supernatant containing plc and lipase. lipase activity in the p. aeruginosa culture supernatant was inhibited by treatment with the lipase-specific inhibitor hexadecylsulfonyl fluoride, leaving the activity of plc unaffected. the capacity  of "lipase-inactivated culture supernatant" to induce 12-hete and ltb4 generation was diminished by 50 to 100%. our results suggest that the simultaneous secretion of lipase and plc by p. aeruginosa residing in an infected host may result in severe pathological effects which cannot be explained by the sole action of the individual virulence factor on inflammatory effector cells.

TI  == in vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam gv104326.
AB  == gv104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). the in vitro activity of gv104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. gv104326  had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. the trinem had no activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against acinetobacter calcoaceticus. gv104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of gv104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. enterococci and lancefield group a and b streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to gv104326 than they were to amoxicillin. streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to gv104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to gv104326 (mic90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). the anaerobes clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, and peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.

TI  == a bacillus sphaericus gene encoding a novel type of mosquitocidal toxin of 31.8 kda.
AB  == a size-fractionated genomic library of bacillus sphaericus strain ssii-1 was constructed and screened for toxicity against larvae of the mosquito culex quinquefasciatus (cq). one toxin-producing clone, ps35, was identified and a 2.7-kb subclone was completely sequenced. an open reading frame of 879 bp encoding a 31.8-kda protein (designated mtx2) was identified. purified, recombinant mtx2 was toxic to cq larvae. mtx2 shows no significant homology to known insecticidal toxins, but has homology to two toxins active against mammalian cells, namely the epsilon-toxin of clostridium perfringens and the cytotoxin of pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, mtx2 represents a new type of mosquitocidal toxin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == the sterrad 100 sterilization system (johnson & johnson medical ltd) uses low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma for sterilization of heat labile equipment. the efficacy of the machine was tested by contaminating a standard set of instruments with different organisms and using a filtration method to assess recovery of organisms from the wash fluids of instruments post-sterilization. experiments were performed under clean (the organism only) and dirty (organism mixed with egg protein) conditions. a parallel study conducted using a 3m sterivac ethylene oxide sterilizer could not be completed owing to closure of the ethylene oxide plant. for sterilization of instruments with long and narrow lumens, hydrogen peroxide adaptors are necessary. the sterrad 100 sterilizer can  achieve effective sterilization of heat labile instruments with a reduction of 6  log10 cfu/ml of organisms tested. this method has the advantages over ethylene oxide sterilization of safety, ease of maintenance and no requirement for aeration time.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

AB  == within the framework of an international project for the sequencing of the entire bacillus subtilis genome, a 36-kb chromosome segment, which covers the region between the gnt and iol operons, has been cloned and sequenced. this region (36447 bp) contains 33 complete open reading frames (orfs; genes) including the four gnt genes and one partial gene. a homology search for the products of the 33 complete orfs revealed significant homology to known proteins in 16 of them such  as tetracycline resistance protein (clostridium perfringens), asparagine synthetase (arabidopsis thaliana), aldehyde dehydrogenase (pseudomonas oleovorans), 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1, 4-diol dehydrogenase (p. paucimobilis), heat shock protein htpg (escherichia coli), galactose-proton symporter (e. coli), auxin-induced protein (common tobacco), glucitol operon repressor (e. coli) and methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (p. aeruginosa). unlike the regions we sequenced so far, this region contained two short sequence multiplications: one was a tandem sequence duplication (409 and 410 bp), and the other a triplication consisting of two highly conserved 118-bp tandem sequences preceded by a less conserved similar sequence (129 bp). the reasons for the presence of these sequence multiplications in the gnt to iol region were deduced.

TI  == induction of inflammatory mediator release (12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) from human platelets by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the role of platelets in acute and chronic infection has been widely discussed in various disease processes. we studied the effects of two lipolytic enzymes (phospholipase c, lipase) secreted by pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis (cf) patients with regard to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-hete) generation from human platelets. both phospholipase c (plc) and lipase  were secreted into the culture supernatant at the end of the logarithmic growth phase. indeed, only culture supernatants obtained from the late logarithmic/early stationary phase of cf strains induced the generation of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-hete) (from 15 +/- 9 to 370 +/- 98 ng, n = 7). purified p. aeruginosa lipase itself generated only small amounts of 12-hete  from human platelets with a maximum of 30 +/- 7 ng/10(8) platelets at the highest concentration tested (20 nkat). a partially purified culture supernatant from p.  aeruginosa strain pao1 containing phospholipase c and lipase, but lacking glycolipid and protease activities, induced time- and dose-dependently a significant 12-hete generation from human platelets. maximal 12-hete generation was observed at the highest enzyme concentrations tested (plc: 1.35 nkat, lipase: 3.7 nkat/10(8) platelets). to analyze whether lipase exhibits a modulatory role on plc-induced 12-hete generation from human platelets we inhibited lipase activity in the p. aeruginosa partially purified culture supernatant by treatment with the lipase-specific inhibitor hexadecylsulfonylfluoride (amsf) leaving the activity of plc unaffected (lipase-free culture supernatant). the capacity of lipase-free culture supernatant to induce 12-hete generation was diminished by up to 100% depending on the plc activity.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, rp 59500, rp 57669 and rp 54476, alone and in combination.
AB  == rp 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of rp 57669 and rp 54476. the activity of rp 59500 and its two components against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. rp 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal  to 1 mg/l (range 0.06-2 mg/l). both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of s. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and  ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group c and g streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l. streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/l. the mic90 was 4 mg/l for haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/l for moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59500 did not inhibit enterobacteriaceae or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of rp 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were bacteroides spp. rp 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. mbcs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae and s. aureus, compared with mbcs in broth, but rp 59500  was as active at ph 6 as at ph 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. rp 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.

TI  == production of the pseudomonas aeruginosa neuraminidase is increased under hyperosmolar conditions and is regulated by genes involved in alginate expression.
AB  == the pathogenesis of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis (cf) is a complex process attributed to specific characteristics of both the host and the infecting organism. in this study, the properties of the pao1 neuraminidase were  examined to determine its potential role in facilitating pseudomonas colonization of the respiratory epithelium. the pao1 neuraminidase was 1000-fold more active than the clostridium perfringens enzyme in releasing sialic acid from respiratory epithelial cells. this effect correlated with increased adherence of pao1 to epithelial cells after exposure to pao1 neuraminidase and was consistent with in  vitro studies demonstrating pseudomonas adherence to asialoganglioside receptors. the regulation of the neuraminidase gene nana was examined in pseudomonas and as  cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. in hyperosmolar conditions neuraminidase expression was increased by 50% (p less than 0.0004), an effect which was ompr dependent in e. coli. in pseudomonas the osmotic regulation of neuraminidase production was dependent upon algr1 and algr2, genes involved in the transcriptional activation of algd, which is responsible for the mucoid phenotype of pseudomonas and pathognomonic for chronic infection in cf. under the hyperosmolar conditions postulated to exist in the cf lung, nana is likely to be  expressed to facilitate the initial adherence of pseudomonas to the respiratory tract.

TI  == newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  == the improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. several  new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. win 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., listeria monocytogenes and bacillus spp. bmy 40062, pd 117558, pd 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these  species. these drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and the bacteroides fragilis group. mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. in addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium leprae. sparfloxacin, bmy 40062 and win 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. improved antibacterial activity has also been found against mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas maltophilia. by contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including plasmodium spp., trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania donovani, but not against toxoplasma gondii. in the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == occlusive dressings. does dressing type influence the growth of common bacterial  pathogens?
AB  == we studied the effect of different occlusive dressings and of air exposure on the growth of four pathogenic bacteria in wounds. partial-thickness wounds on domestic pigs were inoculated with staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. each wound was covered with three dressings (duoderm, opsite, or vigilon), or left exposed to air. groups of wounds were sampled at 24, 48, and 72 hours. staphylococcus aureus reached high levels beneath all of the dressings and in the air-exposed wounds. the numbers of c perfringens and b fragilis were greatly reduced in the air-exposed wounds and slightly reduced in the opsite-covered wounds. the numbers of p aeruginosa were greatest in the opsite- and vigilon-covered wounds. the results indicate that occlusive dressings are not indicated in wounds that clinically appear to be grossly contaminated or that may contain anaerobic organisms.

(10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

TI  == bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum of icr mice and wistar rats orally administered with a single lethal dose of fusarenon-x, a trichothecene mycotoxin.
AB  == a single oral dose of fusarenon-x (f-x), a trichothecene mycotoxin, resulted in abnormal microflora in the jejunum in icr mice and wistar rats with some differences in dose response between the species. in the acute phase, enterobacteria, streptococci, clostridium perfringens and bacteroides showed remarkably increased counts in the jejunum of mice and rats dosed with f-x while  lactobacilli showed a decrease in count. f-x brought an invasion of pseudomonas aeruginosa into the livers, lungs, kidneys and spleens of icr mice. changes in the jejunal microflora appeared after 7 h in icr mice and after 24 h in wistar rats after a single oral dose of f-x of 7.5 and 4.0 mg/kg b.w., respectively, and the microflora returned to its normal state at 72 h in mice and 96 h in rats. the changes of intestinal microflora were followed by alterations in the growth curves of both animal species. the ph in the glandular stomach was also greatly enhanced before changes in the jejunal microflora. acute f-x intoxication may be  an involved manifestation of essential cytotoxicity of f-x mycotoxin alone and secondary bacterial overgrowth in the bowel.

TI  == molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase c) of clostridium perfringens.
AB  == a fragment of dna containing the gene coding for the phospholipase c (alpha-toxin) of clostridium perfringens was cloned into escherichia coli. the cloned dna appeared to code only for the alpha-toxin and contained both the coding region and its associated gene promoter. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned dna was determined, and an open reading frame was identified which encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 42,528. by comparison of the gene sequence with the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, a 28-amino-acid signal sequence was identified. the gene promoter showed considerable homology with the  e. coli sigma 55 consensus promoter sequences, and this may explain why the gene  was expressed by e. coli. the cloned gene product appeared to be virtually identical to the native protein. a 77-amino-acid stretch that was close to the n  terminus of the alpha-toxin showed considerable homology with similarly located regions of the bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine, preferring phospholipase c and weaker homology with the phospholipase c from pseudomonas aeruginosa.

AB  == the results of the bacteriological surveillance cultures for 26 patients with bone marrow transplantation (karl marx university leipzig, g.d.r., 1985-1987) are presented. 5.9% of all surveillance cultures contained facultatively pathogenic germs (with pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most frequent representative, which was the reason of a sepsis in two patients). coagulasenegative staphylococci and other germs with an obscure pathogenicity were isolated upon a large scale, especially from the mucous membrane regions. there are hints, that above all special strains of coagulasenegative staphylococci "colonize" the patient's body  (also for longer periods) and turn into the blood too. during the total decontamination intestinal anaerobic flora is absent. after closing of total decontamination clostridium perfringens is the first detectable anaerobic species. during the selective decontamination systemic applications of antibiotics are able to obliterate anaerobic findings for certain periods. recommendations for an effective arrangement of the surveillance cultures of bone marrow transplantation patients are given.

AB  == the microbial flora of the water produced by two water filtration plants and their drinking water distribution system were evaluated: the pont-viau (pv) and the repentigny (re) water filtration plants. untreated water entering the plants  contained 3.6 (pv) and 16.8 most probable number of infectious units (mpniu)/l (re) enteric viruses and total coliform bacteria counts were 300,000 (pv) and 500,000 cfu/l (re). treated water leaving the plant was essentially free of all the bacterial indicators measured (total, stressed, and fecal coliforms; aeromonas hydrophila; pseudomonas aeruginosa; clostridium perfringens; enterococci) as well as of human enteric viruses. heterotrophic plate counts at 20 and 35 degrees c were low in the freshly treated water leaving the plants, but bacterial regrowth was observed in both distribution systems at all sampling sites. average counts for the heterotrophic plate count (20 degrees c) were between 10(6) and 10(7) cfu/l and counts were clearly increased with the distance from the plant. the most numerous bacterial genera encountered were bacillus, flavobacterium, and pseudomonas (nonaeruginosa).

TI  == [aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  == in a group of 600 patients treated in the metropolitan dermatological hospital in warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. in 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms  was obtained. coagulase-positive staphylococci (st. aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter sp and e. coli)  prevailed. in 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. in the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes  exclusively was noted. pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. in the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were gram-negative bacteria such as bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides sp, and bacteroides fragilis. among pathogenic anerobic cocci peptostreptococcus and peptococcus were most frequent. in 2 cases  spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (clostridium perfringens) were obtained. forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  == ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. high metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens clostridium  perfringens and clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. the same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.

TI  == comparative activity of the 4-quinolones.
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the 4-quinolones ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, difloxacin, a-56620, and ci-934 are consistent world-wide, with allowances for differences in acquired resistance. mics of these drugs for enterobacteriaceae correlate with those of nalidixic acid, but resistance to the quinolones is rare if a breakpoint of greater than 2  mg/l is accepted. most intestinal pathogens are sensitive. acinetobacter, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other pseudomonas species except pseudomonas maltophilia are usually sensitive. ciprofloxacin is generally the most active of  the 4-quinolones against these organisms. all of the new agents have antistaphylococcal activity, but that of norfloxacin and ofloxacin is borderline. against streptococci, including enterococci and pneumococci, the drugs' activity  is moderate or poor. haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis are very  sensitive. gonococci and meningococci are also highly sensitive to the new agents, but activity against chlamydia trachomatis and the mycoplasmas is borderline. the organisms associated with nonspecific vaginal infection are not very sensitive. anaerobes except bacteroides ureolyticus and clostridium perfringens are mostly resistant.

TI  == pathogenicity of clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  == the relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. we used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two bacteroides spp., eight gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric gram-negative aerobic rods. abscesses were induced by all seven clostridium perfringens and three c. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. enhancement was observed mainly with c. perfringens in mixed infections. by contrast, other clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. clostridium difficile and c. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species.  this study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.

TI  == bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  == forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. there were five types of infections. infections commonly associated with a t-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with salmonella species, listeria monocytogenes, cryptococcus neoformans, and histoplasma capsulatum. infections commonly associated with a b-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus faecalis. other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, staphylococcus aureus, and mixed s. aureus and group g streptococcus. other infections occurring out of  the hospital included those with s. aureus, clostridium perfringens, shigella sonnei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group b streptococcus. because two thirds of  the septicemias were caused by organisms other than t-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.

TI  == opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  == guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (crf) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. from 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. faecal streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, citrobacter spp., c. freundii, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the crf of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.

TI  == the antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a proteus sp., an erysipelothrix sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae. tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal  doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma  concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. the intracutaneous injection of fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to  this effect. the in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low mic; a low mic was sometimes associated with little action and a high mic with moderate action. sixteen organisms were tested. the iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of  e. rhusiopathiae. in only one case, with a strain of proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. on the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and c. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-c streptococcus and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, e. rhusiopathiae and a. hydrophila. it is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate  excess of readily available fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement  of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.

(mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == tracheobronchial mucin receptor for pseudomonas aeruginosa: predominance of amino sugars in binding sites.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common respiratory tract colonizer and pathogen, adheres to injured tracheal cells and to tracheobronchial mucin. these phenomena  suggest that there are specific receptors for this organism in the respiratory tract. the receptor on injured tracheal cells contains n-acetylneuraminic acid as the principal sugar, but the structure of the receptor in mucin has not been described. using a microtiter plate assay to study bacterial adherence to mucin,  we have partially characterized the mucin receptor for p. aeruginosa. the receptor for both nonmucoid and mucoid strains is sensitive to periodate oxidation, suggesting that it is carbohydrate in nature, and the amino sugars n-acetylglucosamine and n-acetylneuraminic acid inhibited the adherence of both types of strains. nonmucoid strains were more sensitive to inhibition by n-acetylneuraminic acid than to inhibition by n-acetylglucosamine, but the mucoid strains varied in their sensitivities to inhibition by each amino sugar. preincubation of mucin with heat-inactivated influenza a virus (which binds to neuraminic acid) significantly reduced the adherence of p. aeruginosa. treatment  of mucin with clostridium perfringens neuraminidase also reduced bacterial adherence significantly. treatment of mucin with pronase did not affect adherence. our results suggest that n-acetylglucosamine and n-acetylneuraminic acid are important constituents of the binding sites for p. aeruginosa on human tracheobronchial mucin.

TI  == protective role of intestinal flora against infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice: influence of antibiotics on colonization resistance.
AB  == swiss white mice were given ampicillin, clindamycin, kanamycin, metronidazole, or streptomycin in drinking water for a period of 3 weeks. one week after the initiation of antibiotic administration, the treated mice and untreated control mice were challenged orally with approximately 10(8) viable, streptomycin-resistant (sr) pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. all five of the antibiotics decreased the resistance of the mice to intestinal colonization with  sr p. aeruginosa, as reflected by an increased fecal carriage of the organism and an increase in population levels of sr p. aeruginosa in feces as compared with untreated controls. metronidazole was least effective in this regard. the antibiotics lowered the dose of sr p. aeruginosa that resulted in implantation in 50% of the mice id50 to various degrees. administration of streptomycin, the most effective antibiotic, caused a 10,000-fold decrease in id50 as compared with untreated controls. oral inoculation of approximately 10(8) organisms of sr p. aeruginosa resulted in translocation of the organism to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, or livers of 13 or 17 streptomycin-treated mice, 1 of 20 clindamycin-treated mice, and 1 of 14 metronidazole-treated mice. translocation was not observed, however, in ampicillin- or kanamycin-treated animals. antibiotic activity was detected in the cecal contents of streptomycin-, kanamycin, and clindamycin-treated mice but not in the cecal contents of ampicillin- or metronidazole-treated animals.

AB  == great progress was achieved in the clarification of the molecular structure and the mechanism of action of the toxins of pathogenic forms of bacteria. proportions of toxins of corynebacterium diphtheriae and of pseudomonas aeruginosa transfer from the nad and adp-ribose protein to an amino acid of the elongation factor 2. thus the protein synthesis is much inhibited. the cholera toxin and the l-toxin from escherichia coli have a similar structure. they transfer an adp-ribose portion from nad to the gtp-protein of the adenylate cyclase complex, by which means the gtpase activity is reduced. the increase of the camp content leads to an increase of the permeability of the cells of the intestinal epithelium. the tetanospasmin decreases the production of the inhibitingly acting neurotransmitters ( glycin ) from intermediate neurons and thus evokes spasms. the botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from the motor end-plates and leads to paralyses. staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens form among others cytolysins which are injurious to membranes.

AB  == the effect of bran ingestion on the flora of the human digestive tract was studied using two methods: quantitative enumeration of various microbial populations of the faecal flora, and a demonstration of the antagonistic effect exerted by the faecal flora against various potentially pathogenic bacteria of the environment. since this latter study cannot be effected in human subjects, we used a model constituted by axenic mice inoculated with patients' flora. faecal samples from 3 human donors receiving bran-containing diets were obtained prior to treatment and 30 days thereafter. these faecal samples were inoculated into axenic mice fed a diet with or without bran. the dominant floras of the human donors, before and after bran ingestion, were highly similar. the faecal floras of the gnotoxenic mice resembled those of the donors and no change resulting from the presence of bran in the diet could be observed. the drastic or permissive barrier effects exerted in the gnotoxenic mice by the human donors against clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and pseudomonas  aeruginosa were not modified by the presence of bran in the diet. the large variability between animals in the barrier effect against clostridium difficile masked any possible role of the bran. study of the transit of bacillus spores in  the digestive tract of various mouse groups showed the existence of differences according to the origin of the inoculated floras, but not according to the presence or absence of bran in the diet.

AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.

TI  == effect of erythromycin on microbial antagonisms: a study in gnotobiotic mice associated with a human fecal flora.
AB  == the effect of erythromycin base was studied on intestinal resistance to colonization of gnotobiotic mice inoculated with a human fecal flora and challenged with six microbial strains potentially pathogenic for immunocompromised patients. fecal concentrations of erythromycin were greater than 1,000 micrograms/g in the human donor and in mice. total intestinal bacterial counts were not significantly different in the human donor and in the recipient mice and were not affected by erythromycin treatment. strains of various species from the dominant flora (greater than 10(9) colony-forming units/g) and resistant to greater than 1,000 micrograms of erythromycin/ml were present before and persisted during treatment. strains sensitive to such concentrations - particularly all enterobacteria-were eliminated. treatment did not reduce colonization resistance against candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, and erythromycin-sensitive escherichia coli. it reduced but did not  eliminate some colonization resistance against pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium difficile, and erythromycin-resistant e coli.

TI  == evidence for mucins and sialic acid as receptors for pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower respiratory tract.
AB  == the nature of the receptors for mucoid and nonmucoid pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated by using adherence to injured tracheal epithelium as a model. bovine submaxillary mucin and crude rat tracheal mucin inhibited the adherence of both types of p. aeruginosa. among the sugars present in these mucins only n-aceylneuraminic acid inhibited adherence. inhibition of adherence probably involved the binding of n-acetylneuraminic acid to the bacterial cells and not to the tracheal cells. the mucoid strain appeared to be much more sensitive to inhibition by n-acetylneuraminic acid. periodate oxidation and cholera filtrate also reduced the adherence of both strains, but clostridium perfringens neuraminidase treatment did not alter adherence. a nonmucoid isogenic mutant of an unstable mucoid strain was also inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid. these data suggest that the receptor for p. aeruginosa is a sialic acid moiety on cell  surfaces or in mucins.

AB  == niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. first, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as salmonella and escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole  is completely ineffective. there exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. the in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides spp., clostridium spp., fusobacterium spp. and peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. extremely low mic values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are  also relatively resistant to niridazole.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == ly127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. the lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)s) of ly127935 for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. the mic(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. the  mic(90)s for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. the mic(90)s for anaerobes ranged from  2 to >32 mug/ml. as determined by mic(90)s, ly127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. in a population of multidrug-resistant isolates,  concentrations of 8 mug or less of ly127935 per ml inhibited 82% of enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of enterobacteriaceae and 40% of p. aeruginosa. increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of ly127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some enterobacteriaceae. all four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. the broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of ly127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

AB  == production of protease by many bacteria was found to be inhibited by ammonium salts, and the enzyme production was more sensitive to the salts than was growth  of the organisms. inhibition of protease production by some pathogenic bacteria may result in the recognition of an exotoxin which otherwise would have been digested by the protease. in the case of pseudomonas aeruginosa, qualitatively different toxicities could be demonstrated in the culture fluids, depending on the presence or absence of protease in such a fluid. the toxicity of the culture  in the presence of a high titer of protease may be due primarily to the protease, whereas the toxicity exhibited in the absence of protease could be due to proteinacious exotoxin. producers of high titers of protease tended to be less virulent in vivo than producers of low titers of the enzyme, which exert their toxicities by a separate exotoxin.
