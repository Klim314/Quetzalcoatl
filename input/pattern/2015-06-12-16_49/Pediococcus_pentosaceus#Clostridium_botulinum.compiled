TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of Clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocinogenicity of Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454, Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 43200, P. pentosaceus ATCC 43201, Lactobacillus plantarum BN, L. plantarum LB592, L. plantarum LB75, and Lactobacillus acidophilus N2 against Clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees C was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. All the strains, except L. acidophilus N2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of C. botulinum spores at 30 degrees C. L. plantarum BN, L. lactis ATCC 11454, and P. pentosaceus ATCC 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees C. Supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% NaCl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. Detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of L. plantarum BN and L. lactis ATCC 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees C. These results suggest that low levels of L. plantarum BN or L. lactis ATCC 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% NaCl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
