TI  == [construction of cell surface display system in lactic acid bacteria by using ice nucleation protein].
AB  == objective: the gene of ice nucleation protein (inp), an outer membrane of pseudomonas syringae was tested to display foreign proteins on the surface of lactococcus lactis. methods: plasmids phz101 and phz102 were constructed using gfp (green fluorescence protein) as the reporter gene and n-terminal and nc-terminal of inp as the anchoring units. plasmids phz101 and phz102 were subsequently transformed into escherichia coli jm109 and lactococcus lactis mg1363. results: fluorescence microscope shows that green fluorescence was observed in both recombinant e. coli and l. lactis strains. western blot indicated that gfp was expressed in both recombinant e. coli and l. lactis strains. inpn-gfp was mostly trapped in cytoplastic fraction while inpnc-gfp was  mainly targeted on the cell membrane of l. lactis. conclusion: the results suggest a new way to construct cell surface display system of lactic acid bacteria by using ice nucleation protein.

TI  == genetic and transcriptional analysis of a novel plasmid-encoded copper resistance operon from lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a plasmid-borne copper resistance operon (lco) was identified from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll58-1. the lco operon consists of three structural genes lcoabc. the predicted products of lcoa and lcob were homologous to chromosomally  encoded prolipoprotein diacylglyceral transferases and two uncharacterized proteins respectively, and the product of lcoc is similar to several multicopper  oxidases, which are generally plasmid-encoded. this genetic organization represents a new combination of genes for copper resistance in bacteria. the three genes are co-transcribed from a copper-inducible promoter, which is controlled by lcors encoding a response regulator and a kinase sensor. the five genes are flanked by two insertion sequences, almost identical to is-ll6 from l.  lactis. transposon mutagenesis and subcloning analysis indicated that the three structural genes were all required for copper resistance. copper assay results showed that the extracellular concentration of copper of l. lactis lm0230 containing the lco operon was significantly higher than that of the host strain when copper was added at concentrations from 2 to 3 mm. the results suggest that  the lco operon conferred copper resistance by reducing the intracellular accumulation of copper ions in l. lactis.

TI  == tomato prf is a member of the leucine-rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes and lies embedded within the pto kinase gene cluster.
AB  == in tomato, resistance to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (pst) strains expressing the avirulence gene avrpto requires the presence of at least two host genes, designated pto and prf. here we report that prf encodes a protein with leucine-zipper, nucleotide-binding, and leucine-rich repeat motifs, as are found  in a number of resistance gene products from other plants. prf mutant alleles (4) were found to carry alterations within the prf coding sequence. a genomic fragment containing prf complemented a prf mutant tomato line both for resistance to pst strains expressing avrpto and for sensitivity to the insecticide fenthion. prf resides in the middle of the pto gene cluster, 24 kb from the pto gene and 500 bp from the fen gene.
