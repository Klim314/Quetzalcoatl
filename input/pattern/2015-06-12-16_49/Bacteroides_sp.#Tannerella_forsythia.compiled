TI  - Periodontopathogens levels and clinical response to periodontal therapy in individuals with the interleukin-4 haplotype associated with susceptibility to chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that results from an interaction between dental biofilm agents and the host immune-inflammatory response. Periodontopathogenic organisms, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola, as well as the host's susceptibility, represented by the host's genetic makeup, are the key factors that influence this complex disease. Recently, we identified haplotypes in the IL4 gene that were associated with chronic periodontitis (CP). This study aimed to evaluate whether subjects with different IL4 haplotypes (TCI/CCI and TTD/CTI) would be differentially colonized by periodontopathogens and whether they would respond differently to non-surgical periodontal therapy. Thirty-nine patients carrying the IL4 haplotype of genetic susceptibility to CP (IL4+) or protection against CP (IL4-) were evaluated. Those groups were further subdivided into individuals with CP (CP IL4+ or CP IL4-) and those that were periodontally healthy (H) (H IL4+ or H IL4-). CP patients were submitted to non-surgical periodontal therapy. Clinical and microbiological analyses were performed considering the data at baseline and 45 and 90 days after periodontal therapy. Periodontopathogens levels were evaluated by absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The baseline data revealed that the total levels of periodontopathogens were higher in the CP IL4+ than in the CP IL4- groups. Clinical analyses revealed that the periodontal therapy was equally effective, independent of the subject's IL4 genetic load. The TCI/CCI IL4 haplotype, previously associated with genetic susceptibility to CP, was also associated with increased levels of periodontopathogenic bacteria, but this genetic background did not influence the response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.
TI  - Frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. DESIGN OF STUDY: The presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). RESULTS: The pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). Except for P. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). The frequency of P.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). In periodontal samples, T. forsythia and T. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). The frequencies of C. rectus and T. forsythia were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). The frequency of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. There was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.
TI  - Reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. Salivary arginase activity (SAA) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. Therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the SAA before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. Plaque and Gingival Indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. The presence of Campylobacter rectus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. Salivary total protein level and SAA were also established by spectrophotometry. Clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon, Mann-Withney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests (P < .05). For microbial data, the chi-square test was used. The Pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. RESULTS: After therapy, due to a significant reduction in SAA, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found in the healthy group. Interestingly, after therapy, SAA followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group T forsythia, pre- > posttherapy; periodontitis group P. gingivalis, T. denticola, P. intermedia, and T. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). CONCLUSION: Based on the reduction of SAA after therapy, in accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters, it was concluded that SAA has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.
TI  - The short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. Bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: No halitosis (identified by VSC assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. At day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Tannerella forsythia. A decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: P. gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, S. aureus, and Treponema denticola. Baseline VSC scores were correlated with several bacterial species. The use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of VSC compared to rinsing alone. CONCLUSIONS: VSC scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. The active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. Tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic evaluation, by real-time polymerase chain reaction, of non-surgical treatment of aggressive periodontitis associated with amoxicillin and metronidazole.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic changes resulting from non-surgical periodontal treatment associated with amoxicillin and metronidazole in individuals with aggressive periodontitis. METHODS: Fifteen individuals with aggressive periodontitis received non-surgical periodontal treatment and 45 days after completion of treatment were treated with antibiotics. Clinical data and samples of subgingival plaque were collected at baseline, 45 days after the non-surgical periodontal treatment, and 1 month after the use of antimicrobial agents. After 3 and 6 months, only clinical data were collected. The presence and quantification of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td), and Dialister pneumosintes were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All clinical parameters, with the exception of clinical attachment level (CAL), had significantly (P <0.05) improved at the end of the third month after non-surgical therapy associated with antibiotics. There was significant (P <0.05) reduction in the quantities of Td and Tf. After 1 month, there were significant (P <0.05) reductions in the frequencies of Pg and Tf. CONCLUSION: Non-surgical mechanical treatment associated with the use of amoxicillin and metronidazole led to an improvement in all clinical parameters studied, except for CAL, and significantly reduced the amount of subgingival Tf and Td.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  - The subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. We tested the hypothesis that the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. Subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16S sequencing. Smokers demonstrated greater abundance of Parvimonas, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Bacteroides, and Treponema and lower levels of Veillonella, Neisseria, and Streptococcus. Several uncultivated Peptostreptococci, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter gracilis, Treponema socranskii, Dialister pneumosintes, and Tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while Veillonella sp. oral clone B2, Neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Capnocytophaga sp. clone AH015 were at lower levels. The microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.
TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Full-mouth ultrasonic debridement associated with amoxicillin and metronidazole in the treatment of severe chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adjunctive clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic effects of the systemic administration of amoxicillin and metronidazole in the full-mouth ultrasonic debridement of patients with severe chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Twenty-five patients presenting at least eight teeth with probing depth (PD) > or =5 mm and bleeding on probing (BOP) were selected and randomly assigned to full-mouth ultrasonic debridement + placebo (control group) or full-mouth ultrasonic debridement + amoxicillin and metronidazole (test group). The clinical outcomes evaluated were visible plaque index, BOP, position of the gingival margin, relative attachment level (RAL), and PD. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for quantitative analysis of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique permitted the detection of prostaglandin E(2,) interleukin-1beta, and interferon-gamma levels in gingival crevicular fluid. All parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. RESULTS: At 6 months, the test treatment resulted in lower BOP and an additional reduction (0.83 mm) in PD (P <0.05). Data also showed RAL gain > or =2 mm at 43.52% of sites in control patients compared to 58.03% of sites in test patients (P <0.05). However, both groups had similar mean RAL gain (1.68 and 1.88 mm for the control and test groups, respectively). Real-time PCR and ELISA failed to identify significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments resulted in significant clinical improvements; however, there was a slight, but significantly greater, improvement in BOP and the percentage of sites with PD > or =5 mm exhibiting RAL gain > or =2 mm in the test group. Nevertheless, no improvement in the microbiologic or immunologic outcome was observed with the adjunctive use of systemic amoxicillin and metronidazole.
TI  - Detection of herpesviruses and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis, or gingivitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpesviruses may be related to the etiology of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) by triggering periodontal destruction or by increasing the risk for bacterial infection. This case-control study evaluated the presence of herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus type I (EBV-1), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) in patients with generalized AgP (AgP group), CP (CP group), or gingivitis (G group) and in healthy individuals (C group). METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected with paper points from 30 patients in each group. The nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect HSV-1, EBV-1, and HCMV. Bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA-based PCR. RESULTS: HSV-1, HCMV, and EBV-1 were detected in 86.7%, 46.7%, and 33.3% of the AgP group, respectively; in 40.0%, 50.0%, and 46.7% of the CP group, respectively; in 53.3%, 40.0%, and 20.0% of the G group, respectively; and in 20.0%, 56.7%, and 0.0% of the C group, respectively. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected significantly more often in the AgP group compared to the other groups (P <0.005). P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were identified more frequently in AgP and CP groups, and AgP, CP, and G groups had higher frequencies of P. intermedia compared to the C group. CONCLUSION: In Brazilian patients, HSV-1 and EBV-1, rather than HCMV, were more frequently associated with CP and AgP.
TI  - Detection of periodontal pathogens in oral mucous membranes of edentulous individuals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the colonization of Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) in the tongue and cheek of newborns and elderly individuals with no teeth. METHODS: Seventy-four edentulous subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. Microbiologic samples were taken from the dorsum of the tongue and cheek mucosa of all individuals and analyzed using a bacterial DNA-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: C. rectus was the most prevalent species in both groups (20.9% in the cheek of newborns, and 77.4% in the tongue of elderly subjects). P. gingivalis and P. intermedia were not detected in any of the 43 newborns; however, P. gingivalis was recovered from the tongue and cheek (3.2%) of elderly individuals, whereas P. intermedia was detected in the tongue (9.6%) and cheek (3.2%) of elderly individuals. T. forsythia was detected in newborns as well as elderly individuals, although the highest prevalence was observed in the tongue of newborns (6.9%) and elderly (9.6%) individuals. A. actinomycetemcomitans was not found in the tongue of newborns, but we observed A. actinomycetemcomitans in the cheek (2.3%) of newborns and in the tongue (12.9%) and cheek (6.4%) of elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although we did not detect P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in newborns, periodontal pathogens could be detected from the oral mucous membranes of edentulous individuals. Our results suggest that major attention should be paid to edentulous individuals as an important measure in the prevention of the initial colonization of natural teeth and dental implants by periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. This study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in older persons. METHODS: Elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. Two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [AP]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (PD) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [SP]), if they did not. Groups were compared with respect to demographics, PD, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hsCRP, interleukin (IL)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. RESULTS: Ten AP and 24 SP subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the AP group (P <0.05). Most Asians were SP; most whites and all African Americans were classified as having AP (P <0.01). More AP elders had osteoporosis (P <0.01), but the AP and SP groups did not differ with respect to IL-1beta and -6 or hsCRP. Bacterial counts were higher in the AP group for Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; P <0.05), Prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; P <0.01), Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; P <0.05), and Streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; P <0.01). Three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: PD, osteoporosis, and being white or African American. CONCLUSION: Periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, PD, gender, serum hsCRP, and levels of four bacterial species.
TI  - Clinical and laboratory evaluations of non-surgical periodontal treatment in subjects with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory changes 3 months after full-mouth scaling and root planing in subjects with and without diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This study was performed using 10 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who required insulin therapy (DM) and 10 healthy adult control subjects (NDM) with generalized chronic periodontal disease. Both groups were treated with full-mouth scaling and root planing and given oral hygiene instructions. Clinical parameters, including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), gingival recession (GR), and clinical attachment level (CAL), were measured at four sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from sites with the deepest PD (> or =5 mm) and with furcations in each subject. Samples were also tested for the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) by polymerase chain reaction. Glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] and fasting glucose levels) and clinical and microbiologic assessments were recorded at baseline and 3 months after periodontal treatment. RESULTS: Data revealed statistical changes (P < or =0.05; analysis of variance [ANOVA]) in clinical variables (PI, GI, PD, GR, and CAL) between baseline and 3 months in both groups. Conversely, no improvement in the fasting glucose level or glycosylated hemoglobin (P < or =0.05; ANOVA) was found after treatment. Besides some reduction in the bacterial frequency 3 months after treatment, no statistically significant difference was found between the groups. CONCLUSION: Clinical and laboratory responses were similar in DM and NDM groups 3 months after full-mouth scaling and root planing.
TI  - Bacterial examination of endodontic infections by clonal analysis in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Samples collected from five infected root canals were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with universal 16S ribosomal DNA primers. Products of these PCRs were cloned and sequenced. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used as a screening method to reduce the number of clones necessary for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: All samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. In total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. Olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Dialister invisus, Lachnospiraceae oral clone, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. The majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example Tannerella forsythia, Shuttleworthia satelles and Filifactor alocis. Some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.
TI  - Implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. Twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. Before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. After implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. Periodontal pathogens such as Aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. Surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. Foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. Although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.
TI  - Molecular analysis of Filifactor alocis, Tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola associated with primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of strict anaerobes such as Filifactor alocis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola in primary and secondary root-infected canals with periapical lesions by molecular analysis and the association of these species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. Microbial samples were taken from 100 root canals, 50 with necrotic pulp tissues (NPT, primary infection), and 50 with failed endodontic treatment (FET, secondary infection). DNA was extracted from the samples, which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens using species-specific primers and PCR. F. alocis were isolated from 23 canals with NPT and 12 canals with FET; T. forsythia from 12 canals with NPT and three canals with FET; T. denticola from 19 canals with NPT and 12 canals with TEP. Suggested associations were found between primary infection and the presence of F. alocis and T. forsythia (both p < 0.05). In particular, associations were found between: pain and F. alocis; swelling and F. alocis; tenderness to percussion and T. forsythia; mobility and T. forsythia and T. denticola; wet canals and F. alocis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola; purulent exsudate and F. alocis, T. forsythia and T. denticola; abscess and F. alocis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola (all p < 0.05). The findings of this study indicated that F. alocis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola seem to be associated with endodontic signs and symptoms. Additionally, F. alocis and T. forsythia were detected more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.
