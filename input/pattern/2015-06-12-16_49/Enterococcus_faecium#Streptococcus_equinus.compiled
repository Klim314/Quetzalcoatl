TI  - [Recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: The bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.
TI  - Is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy?
AB  - Heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem. Patients can benefit from an open dialogue between both cardiologists and gastroenterologists for the optimal effective patients care. The focused update on infective endocarditis of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 (ACC/AHA guidelines) and guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis (IE) as not recommended for gastroscopy and colonoscopy in the absence of active infection but increasing evidence suggests that the role of IE antibiotic prophylaxis remains a dark side of the cardio-oncology prevention. New evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, and new findings indicate that there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.
TI  - Chemical composition and nutrient degradability in elephant grass silage inoculated with Streptococcus bovis isolated from the rumen.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess the chemical and bromatological  composition and in situ degradability of elephant grass silages inoculated with Streptococcus bovis isolated from cattle rumen. A complete randomized design was used with four treatments and six replications: elephant grass silage, elephant grass silage inoculated with 10(6) CFU/g Streptococcus bovis JB1 strains; elephant grass silage inoculated with 106 CFU/g Streptococcus bovis HC5 strains; elephant grass silage inoculated with 106 CFU/g Enterococcus faecium with six replications each. The pH and ammoniacal nitrogen values were lower (P<0.05) for the silages inoculated with Streptococcus bovis JB1 and HC5, respectively. The silage inoculated with Streptococcus bovis had a higher crude protein content (P<0.05) and there were no differences for the fiber contents in the silage. The (a)soluble fraction degradability, especially in the silages inoculated with Streptococcus bovis JB1 and HC5, had higher values, 30.77 and 29.97%, for dry matter and 31.01 and 36.66% for crude protein, respectively. Inoculation with Streptococcus bovis improved the fermentation profile, protein value and rumen degradability of the nutrients.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Comparison of nitroethane, 2-nitro-1-propanol, lauric acid, Lauricidin(R) and the Hawaiian marine algae, Chaetoceros, for potential broad-spectrum control of anaerobically grown lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract of bovines often contains bacteria that contribute to  disorders of the rumen, and may also contain foodborne or opportunistic human pathogens as well as bacteria capable of causing mastitis in cows. Thus there is a need to develop broad-spectrum therapies that are effective while not leading to unacceptably long antibiotic withdrawal times. The effects of the CH(4)-inhibitors nitroethane (2 mg/mL), 2-nitro-1-propanol (2 mg/mL), lauric acid (5 mg/mL), the commercial product Lauricidin(R) (5 mg/mL), and a finely ground product of the Hawaiian marine algae, Chaetoceros (10 mg/mL), were compared in pure cultures of Streptococcus agalactia, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus bovis, and in a mixed lactic acid rumen bacterial culture. Lauricidin(R) and lauric acid exhibited the most bactericidal acidity against all bacteria. These results suggest potential animal health benefits from supplementing cattle diets with lauric acid or Lauricidin(R) to improve the health of the rumen and help prevent shedding of human pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in European hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance (2003-2009).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the European medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). A total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 European countries, Turkey and Israel. the collection included S. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [MRSA]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 6,874), Enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107). The organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cSSTI (23%). Daptomycin was very active against S. aureus and CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). Daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and S. bovis (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).In summary, daptomycin was very potent against this large collection (36,769) of Gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. Decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since EMEA approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary Gram-positive species.
TI  - Detection and characterization of pediocin PA-1/AcH like bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Fifty-five bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from seven different sources. Eight isolates were found to produce pediocin PA-1 like bacteriocin as detected by pedB gene PCR and dot-blot hybridization. The culture filtrate (CF) activity of these isolates exhibited strong antilisterial, antibacterial activity against tested food-borne pathogens and LAB. The identification and genetic diversity among the selected LAB was performed by conventional morphological and molecular tools like RFLP, RAPD, and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The isolates were identified as, 1 each of Pediococcus acidilactici Cb1, Lactobacillus plantarum Acr2, and Streptococcus equinus AC1, 2 were of P. pentosaceus Cb4 and R38, and other 3 were Enterococcus faecium Acr4, BL1, V3. Partial characterization of the bacteriocins revealed that the peptide was heat-stable, active at acidic to alkaline pH, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and had molecular weight around 4.6 kDa and shared the properties of class IIa pediocin-family. The bacteriocin production at different temperatures, pH, and salt concentrations was studied to investigate the optimal condition for application of these isolates as a starter culture or as a biopreservative in either acidic or non-acidic foods.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.
TI  - Screening of surface properties and antagonistic substances production by lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the mammary gland of healthy and mastitic cows.
AB  - Bovine mastitis (BM) is a costly disease in dairy cattle production. The prevention and treatment of mastitis is performed by applying antimicrobial products that negatively affect milk quality. In the last years, the use of probiotic microorganisms to prevent infections in humans and animals has being aggressively studied. Samples from teat canal and milk (foremilk and stripping) were taken from healthy and mastitic mammary quarters. A screening of the surface properties and antagonistic substances production of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the mammary gland was performed to select potential probiotic strains to prevent mastitis. Somatic cell count, physico-chemical and microbiological studies were carried out. Pre-selected microorganisms were genetically identified. Compared with stripping milk, foremilk showed lower levels of fat and higher levels of pH, density, microorganism numbers, lower percentage of strains with mean and high hydrophobicity and mean autoaggregation and higher number of strains able to produce hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. The other parameters analyzed were not statistically significant. One hundred and two LAB strains were isolated. Most of them had low degrees of hydrophobicity and autoaggregation. No correlation between these properties was found. Antagonistic metabolites were mainly produced by strains isolated from healthy quarters. Most of the pre-selected strains were identified as Streptococcus bovis and Weissella paramesenteroides. Three bacteriocin-producers were found and their products partially characterized. The results of this work are the basis for the further design of a specie-specific probiotic product able to prevent BM.
TI  - A traditional Sudanese fermented camel's milk product, Gariss, as a habitat of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius.
AB  - Samples of the traditional Sudanese fermented camel's milk product Gariss representing 9 different regions in Sudan were microbiologically characterized using an integrated approach including phenotypic and genotypic methods. Lactic acid bacteria [log(CFU/g)=7.76-8.66] and yeasts [log(CFU/g)=6.05-7.79] were detected in high numbers. A total of 180 LAB isolates were identified of which 123 isolates were found to belong to the Streptococcus bovis group. Thirteen representative isolates were characterized by PCR amplification and sequencing of the housekeeping genes rpoB and sodA and the streptococcal glucosyltransferase gene (gtf). All thirteen isolates were identified as Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, a potential human pathogen. The gene encoding the virulence determinant gtf was detected in 10 of the 13 tested strains. The same isolates were able to survive exposure to 0.3% (w/v) oxgall for 4 h and pH=2.7 for 1-4 h. Also Lactobacillus fermentum were detected in high numbers, whereas Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus helveticus were detected more occasionally. The yeast microflora in all Gariss samples consisted of Kluyveromyces marxianus and Issatchenkia orientalis with the former being predominant in 7 out of 9 samples.
TI  - Isolation and identification of mixed linked beta -glucan degrading bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens and partial characterization of respective 1,3-1,4-beta -glucanase activities.
AB  - Media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (NSP) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. Formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. E. faecium , Streptococcus , Bacteroides and Clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind gut of chickens. Strict anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides ovatus , B. uniformis , presumably B. capillosus and Clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16S rDNA homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. Additionally, Streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. Different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in SDS/PAGE zymograms.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns of vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus equinus isolated from animal foods and epidemiological typing of resistant S. equinus by microbial uniprimer kit.
AB  - Raw milk samples, and cow and chicken intestines were tested to isolate vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. From these samples, we isolated seven vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus equinus, two vancomycin-resistant viridans Streptococcus and two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The MICs of several antibiotics, including vancomycin, against these strains were tested. Seven isolates of S. equinus showed high level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin (>100 microg/mL). The cell wall thickness of these strains was compared with that of the sensitive strain by TEM and no differences were obserbed between these strains. We compared the strains of vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus equinus using PCR with Microbial Uniprimer Kit. We concluded that it is necessary to combine other methods in order to cluster and identify all isolates of S. equinus.
TI  - Effects of bacterial direct-fed microbials on ruminal fermentation, blood variables, and the microbial populations of feedlot cattle.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether bacterial direct-fed microbials (DFM)  could be used to minimize the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle receiving high concentrate diets. Six ruminally cannulated steers, previously adapted to a high concentrate diet, were used in a double 3 x 3 Latin square to study the effects of DFM on feed intake, ruminal pH, and ruminal and blood characteristics. Steers were provided ad libitum access to a diet containing steam-rolled barley, barley silage, and a protein-mineral supplement at 87, 9, and 4% (DM basis), respectively. Treatments were as follows: control, Propionibacterium P15 (P15), and Propionibacterium P15 and Enterococcus faecium EF212 (PE). The bacterial treatments (10(9) cfu/g) plus whey powder carrier, or whey powder alone for control, were top-dressed once daily at the time of feeding (10 g/[steer/d]). Periods consisted of 2 wk of adaptation and 1 wk of measurements. Ruminal pH was continuously measured for 6 d using indwelling electrodes. Dry matter intake and ruminal pH (mean, minimum, hours, and area pH < 5.8 or < 5.5) were not affected by treatment (P > 0.05). However, supplementation with P15 increased protozoal numbers (P < 0.05) with a concomitant increase in ruminal NH3 concentration (P < 0.01) and a decrease in the number of amylolytic bacteria (P < 0.05) compared with the control. Streptococcus bovis, enumerated using a selective medium, was numerically reduced with supplementation of PE. Although blood pH and blood glucose were not affected by DFM supplementation, steers fed PE had numerically lower concentrations of blood CO2 than control steers, which is consistent with a reduced risk of metabolic acidosis. Although the bacterial DFM used in this study did not induce changes in DMI or ruminal and blood pH, some rumen and blood variables indicated that the bacterial DFM used in this study may decrease the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle.
TI  - Source of enterococci in a farmhouse raw-milk cheese.
AB  - Enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. Their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the intestines of insects and birds. The source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is unknown. In the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to type 646 Enterococcus strains which were isolated from a Cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. Nine different PFGE patterns, three of Enterococcus casseliflavus, five of Enterococcus faecalis, and one of Enterococcus durans, were found. The same three clones, one of E. faecalis and two of E. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. The two E. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. It is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. Cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk or the cheese.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - On the microbiological profile of traditional Portuguese sourdough.
AB  - Traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. To this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. More than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via Biomerieux API galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. The dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The most frequently isolated yeasts were Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida pelliculosa. The most frequently isolated LAB were (heterofermentative) Leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) Lactobacillus spp.; L. brevis, L. curvatus, and L. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the Lactobacillus genera; Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; Enterococcus casseliflavus, E. durans, and E. faecium for enterococci; and Streptococcus constellantus and S. equinus for streptococci.
TI  - A bacteriocin-mediated antagonism by Enterococcus faecium BC25 against ruminal Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - A bacteriocin-like activity produced by Enterococcus faecium BC25, isolated from  the the rumen of a cow, was partially purified and characterized. The active substance was prepared by ammonium sulfate and chloroform/methanol precipitation of culture supernatant. The bacteriocin was a protein of molecular mass 17.5 kDa. Activity was inactivated by trypsin and proteinase K. The bacteriocin BC25 inhibited growth of amylolytic ruminal strains of Streptococcus bovis, including S. bovis AO 24/85. Results showed that bacteriocine substance BC25 has a bacteriostatic effect when present in concentrations exceeding 125 AU/ml. Agar overlays and batch culture growth experiments proved that E. faecium BC25 was producing bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of S. bovis.
TI  - Inhibition effect of enterocin CCM 4231 in the rumen fluid environment.
AB  - Enterocin CCM 4231 is a bacteriocin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum produced  by the ruminal strain Enterococcus faecium CCM 4231. Its inhibitory effect towards enterococci, Ent. faecium EF 26/42, staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Escherichia coli, as well as towards Listeria monocytogenes OHIO strain, in the rumen fluid environment was studied during culture at 37 and 30 degrees C for 24 h and 20 days. Enterocin CCM 4231 was added to the samples at a concentration of 3200 AU ml-1. The best inhibitory effect was noted against enterococci at both cultivation temperatures. A decrease in total cell count from 10(8) cfu ml-1/or 10(4) cfu ml-1 and from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 was detected. Addition of enterocin to the rumen fluid also inhibited staphylococci (from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(4) cfu ml-1 and/or 10(3) cfu ml-1). Gram-negative E. coli cells were inhibited at both cultivation temperatures (decrease from 10(6) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 at 37 degrees C, and from 10(7) cfu ml-1 to 10(5) cfu ml-1 at 30 degrees C). Enterococcus faecium EF 26/42 and Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85, the strains growing in the rumen fluid, were the most sensitive to the addition of enterocin during the first 24 h of fermentation (decrease from 10(10) cfu ml-1 and 10(8) cfu ml-1 to 10(6) cfu ml-1 and 10(4) cfu ml-1). An antilisterial effect of the bacteriocin was also confirmed. Further application of bacteriocin in ruminal ecology was indicated.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - [Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx Strep D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.

TI  - Emergence of vancomycin resistance in the genus Streptococcus: characterization of a vanB transferable determinant in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis NEM760 was isolated from a stool swab collected on admission  from a patient as surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Strain NEM760 was identified as S. bovis by conventional biochemical methods and partial sequence analysis of its 16S rRNA. This strain was resistant to a low level of vancomycin (MIC, 64 micrograms/ml) but was susceptible to teicoplanin (MIC, 1 micrograms/ml), and vancomycin induced resistance to both glycopeptides. The presence of a vanB-related gene in NEM760 was demonstrated in a PCR assay which enabled specific amplification of a 635-hp internal segment of vanB. Sequence analysis of the corresponding PCR product revealed that it was highly homologous (96% identity) to the prototype vanB sequence of Enterococcus faecalis V583. The VanB resistance of determinant of S. bovis NEM760 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium at a similar frequency of 2 x 10(-5) per donor. SmaI-digested genomic DNAs of independently obtained transconjugants of E. faecalis and E. faecium were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization with a vanB DNA probe. The electrophoretic and hybridization patterns obtained with all transconjugants of the same species were indistinguishable and revealed vanB-containing chromosomal insertions of approximately 100 kb. These results suggest that the genes mediating VanB-type resistance in S. bovis NEM760 are part of large transferable genetic elements. The results presented in the report demonstrate for the first time the role of streptococci in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance among gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Rapid identification of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  - Diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Streptococcus bovis, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes. Principal components analysis of the FT-IR spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their FT-IR spectra. By contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their FT-IR spectra. These results demonstrate that the combination of FT-IR and ANNs provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.
TI  - Survey of urease activity in ruminal bacteria isolated from domestic and wild ruminants.
AB  - A total of 909 strains, including Selenomonas ruminantium, Lactobacillus sp., Enterococcus sp. and Staphylococcus sp., from the rumen of 104 domestic and wild ruminants was used in tests for urease activity. Tests showed that 56.7% of S. ruminantium strains and 18.5% of lactobacilli manifested medium urease activity with mean values of 14.4 +/- 2.5 and 13.85 +/- 0.25 nkat ml-1, respectively. Most of the Enterococcus faecium (62.2%) and all of the E. faecalis isolates expressed urease activity with mean values of 3.9 +/- 0.05 and 4.1 +/- 0.06 nkat ml-1. E. malodoratus, E. solitarius, E. mundtii, Streptococcus bovis and S. uberis did not produce any urease. All the staphylococci screened were urease-producing strains, mostly with medium or low urease activity. The highest level of urease was measured in the rumen epithelial wall of isolates SE30 (19.7 +/- 2.71 nkat ml-1 of rumen content), SCU32 (29.3 +/- 1.6 nkat ml-1) and also in the rumen content isolates EF35 (19.9 +/- 0.94 nkat ml-1) and S. ruminantium 77 (25.35 nkat ml-1). This survey contributes new data to existing information relating to the ureolytic microbial ecosystem in ruminants.
TI  - Use of cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar for selective isolation of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar (CAA), a new selective agar, was examined in  comparison with nalidixic acid-colistin agar for the differentiation of Enterococcus faecium from other enterococci and the ability to isolate the organism from feces. Two hundred sixteen enterococcus isolates and a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative control strains were inoculated onto both media. All control strains of E. faecium were easily differentiated from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus durans on the basis of arabinose fermentation on CAA. Differentiation of E. faecium from other enterococci or Streptococcus bovis was not possible on nalidixic acid-colistin agar. Increased isolation of E. faecium was demonstrated on CAA when both media were compared for the isolation of the organism from feces. CAA has been shown to possess excellent differential and selective features allowing the simple and effective isolation of E. faecium from heavily contaminated sites.
TI  - Identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was the most frequent Streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of Strep. dysgalactiae. The intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of Strep. bovis, Strep. hyointestinalis and Strep. suis. Many of these intestinal Strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. Nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as Strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. This species was not found in tonsils and intestines but was about equally prevalent as Strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. Other streptococci were rare in this material. Enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. In intestinal samples Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Ent. hirae and Ent. cecorum were most frequently found. In faeces Ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. The characteristics of the less well known species Strep. alactolyticus and Strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines for their differentiation from Strep. bovis and Strep. suis given.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of tetracycline resistance in rumen streptococcal strains.
AB  - In 11% of tested Streptococcus bovis strains a conjugative transfer of tetracycline resistance was observed when mating experiments were carried out on membrane filters. The recipient strain used was S. bovis BM114 with chromosomal resistance to rifampicin. In addition, in two strains tetracycline resistance was transferred also to recipient strain Enterococcus faecium AL6. The transfer frequencies were in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-3). The donor strains were screened for the presence of plasmids and one up to four bands of plasmid DNA in all tested strains were revealed. In spite of that isolation of plasmid DNA was successful only in 53/4/114 transconjugants. Transconjugant 32/114 contained amylase activity which was higher than in the donor strain.
TI  - [Regulation of enzymes of the first and last stage of lysine biosynthesis in Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecium].
AB  - Regulation of aspartate kinase and diaminopimelate decarboxylase activities in Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecium cell-free extracts was studied. The levels of synthesis of aspartate kinase and diaminopimelate decarboxylase in both microorganisms are growth-dependent. The synthesis of these enzymes is depressed by lysine, but the activity of aspartate kinase is induced by addition of this amino acid and threonine to the reaction system. Meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase activity was not found in the extracts of Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecium. The data excludes the possibility of lysine formation via six enzyme reactions.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins from Enterococcus faecium with activity against  Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Laboratory cultures and environmental isolates of bacteria were screened for antagonism towards Listeria monocytogenes using an agar spot test. Seven of the 163 strains that were tested, one Streptococcus bovis, one Enterococcus casseliflavus, two E. avium and three E. faecium, consistently displayed antilisterial activity. Cell-free, pH-neutralized supernatants prepared from the three E. faecium strains (JBL1061, JBL1083 and JBL1351) exhibited strong antilisterial activity against L. monocytogenes, and were subjected to more detailed analyses. The antagonistic factors produced by these three strains were sensitive to chloroform and several proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat (121 degrees C, 20 min), and stable over a wide pH range (3.0-10.0). Moreover, they were listericidal without causing cell lysis. These data suggest that a bacteriocin(s) is involved in the inhibition of L. monocytogenes by E. faecium JBL1061, JBL1083 and JBL1351.
TI  - Development and use of species-specific oligonucleotide probes for differentiation of Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus parauberis.
AB  - Oligonucleotide probes specific for 16S rRNA and capable of differentiating Streptococcus uberis and S. parauberis from each other and other esculin-hydrolyzing streptococci were developed. Use of a mini-RNA extraction technique for gram-positive cocci associated with bovine mastitis has allowed the probes to be used for identification of esculin-hydrolyzing streptococci from two dairy herds at the Institute for Animal Health, Compton, United Kingdom. One hundred seventy-nine of 206 isolates were identified as S. uberis, 3 were identified as S. parauberis, and 24 were not identified. Isolates not identified by the probes were tested biochemically and found to be mainly Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, or S. bovis.
TI  - [The effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  - Some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. Staphylococcus cohnii SC7, Staphylococcus sp. ZTJ 151, S. saprophyticus SS 877, Enterococcus faecium EF1 and E. faecalis EFG2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves and fallow deer, Enterococcus gallinarum EG10 and E. avium EA12 were isolated from the caecum of Japanese quail. The tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and urease activity (Tab. III). These culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and VL agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (ZAG, ZAL, VLG, VLL), agar for isolation of faecal streptococci (SA) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (KA4, KA2). The strains Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Staphylococcus aureus Oxford 209 P were used as indicator bacteria. Tables I and II show the results of these tests. The tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on SA medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. On ZAG medium, the zones of enterococci with the AO 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. All strains with the 209P indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. The larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the ZAL medium with the AO24/85 strain. The production of tested strains was balanced on VLG agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification and composition of the tonsillar and anal enterococcal and streptococcal flora of dogs and cats.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated enterococcal species from  anal swabs and tonsils of dogs and cats, although in the anal samples from dogs Ent. hirae was found almost as often as Ent. faecalis. Most Ent. faecium strains from dog tonsils differed from those associated with humans and other animals in that they fermented sorbitol. Typical Ent. avium as well as atypical Ent. avium-like strains were seen in dogs, while the related species Ent. raffinosus was associated with cat tonsils. Enterococcus cecorum also occurred mainly in cats. Certain atypical strains, presumptively identified as Ent. cecorum, shared characteristics with Ent. columbae. The most frequent streptococcal species in tonsils of cats and dogs were Streptococcus suis and Strep. canis. Streptococcus canis and Strep. bovis predominated in anal swabs. The canine Strep. suis differed from the common porcine strains in fermenting mannitol. Forty-seven of the 288 isolates examined could not be identified or related to known species. The characteristics of two groups of these bacteria, provisionally called 'Ton 31 group' and 'O7 group' are described.
TI  - Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  - Twelve bacterial species including Streptococcus uberis, S. parauberis, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. bovis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. saccharolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. avium, and Aerococcus viridans were examined for their 16S ribosomal DNA fingerprint patterns. Oligonucleotide primers complementary to 16S rRNA genes were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction 16S ribosomal gene fragments from genomic DNAs. The molecular sizes of the amplified 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments from the 12 species examined ranged from 1,400 to 1,500 bp. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rDNA was performed with 11 different restriction endonucleases. All 12 species examined could be differentiated on the basis of characteristic 16S rDNA fingerprint patterns by using the restriction endonucleases HhaI, RsaI, and MspI. A scheme for the differentiation of the 12 species is presented. Eleven isolates representing 11 species were obtained from cows with intramammary infections and were examined by 16S rDNA fingerprinting. All 11 species isolated from cows were differentiated by using HhaI, RsaI, and MspI restriction endonucleases. The results of this study demonstrate the potential application of 16S rDNA fingerprinting for the identification and differentiation of bacterial species.
TI  - The distribution of homologous enterococcal plasmid DNA sequences in human faecal isolates.
AB  - Hybridization was used to investigate the distribution of enterococcal plasmid sequences among 306 strains of Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. isolated from faeces of humans of various ages. As DNA probes for the survey three plasmids, whose DNAs did not hybridize each other and designated as pMS13, pTW34 and pHK30, were selected from plasmids borne in Ent. faecalis. pTW34 DNA hybridized only with DNAs from enterococci, with high frequency in Ent. faecalis and low frequency in Ent. faecium. pMS13 DNA hybridized with DNAs of all Enterococcus spp. tested and with Strep. bovis, Strep. equinus and Strep. salivarius. Eighty-five percent of Ent. faecium isolates had sequences homologous to pMS13 but in the other species the values were less than 60%. Some enterococci had DNAs which hybridized with the pHK30 probe. The different distribution of the three DNA sequences indicates the possibility that plasmid DNAs encode advantageous phenotypes for the colonization of bacteria in the lumen of the bowel.
TI  - Characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA.
AB  - A restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of chromosomal DNA for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. The DNA was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme Sal I to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. One hundred and eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated British Antarctic Survey Base. The epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. This technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. A sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli. Discrimination between isolates was poorer than with REA, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.
TI  - Enterococcal and streptococcal species isolated from faeces of calves, young cattle and dairy cows.
AB  - Faeces from non-ruminating calves were found to contain several species of enterococci: Enterococcus avium, Ent. cecorum, Ent. durans, Ent. faecalis, Ent. faecium and Ent. hirae. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequent. Few of these animals carried streptococci. Streptococcus bovis largely predominated in ruminating calves, young cattle and dairy cows. Other streptococci as well as enterococci were infrequent in dairy cows, but a variety of other streptococci and enterococci were found in the faeces of young ruminating animals.
TI  - DAP-decarboxylase activity and lysine production by rumen bacteria.
AB  - The last step of pathway of lysine biosynthesis by rumen bacteria was tested. The first measurements of DAP-decarboxylase activity and of lysine production by Megasphera elsdenii, Selenomonas ruminantium, Clostridium spp., Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Bacteroides succinogenes as well as the first attempts to increase the lysine production by ruminal streptococci by mutation are described. The highest values were measured in Selenomonas ruminantium (DAP-decarboxylase activity = 146 micrograms DAP.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 390 micrograms.mg-1 protein) and the lowest values were ascertained in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (DAP-decarboxylase activity = 27 micrograms DAP.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 32 micrograms.mg-1 protein). DAP-decarboxylase activity was increased by mutation especially in Streptococcus bovis, the lysine production in both of tested ruminal streptococci. The potential use of lysine-excreting mutants in calves in future is suggested.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  - Tosufloxacin tosylate (TOSU) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (TEMA) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered in a hospital microbiology laboratory (Bellevue Regional Teaching Hospital). Species included S. pneumoniae (n = 20), group A streptococci (n = 22), group B streptococci (n = 30), group G streptococci (n = 17), group D S. bovis (n = 19), Enterococcus faecium (n = 45), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), S. sanguis (n = 21), S. milleri (n = 29) and S. mitis (n = 17). Activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pefloxacin (PEF). Activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the MIC 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: TOSU, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, TEMA 0.5 to 2 mg/l, CIP, 1 to 4 mg/l and PEF 8 to 32 mgl. Overall, TOSU and TEMA exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. The size of the inoculum had no significant effect on MIC values.
TI  - Selection and application of Streptococcus bovis as a silage inoculant.
AB  - Three strains of Streptococcus bovis, a homolactic bacterium capable of utilizing starch, were evaluated for growth kinetics and ability to decrease the pH of alfalfa silage. A selected strain was evaluated for its competitiveness as an inoculant with Enterococcus faecium, an organism used in inoculants, and for its ability to enhance the effect of a commercial inoculant. Testing was completed over three studies using wilted alfalfa (28 to 34% dry matter) ensiled into laboratory silos. Treatments were control, E. faecium, E. faecium and commercial inoculant, S. bovis, and S. bovis and commercial inoculant. Replicate silos were emptied and analyzed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 40 days for pH, fermentation products, and nitrogen fractions. S. bovis alone lowered the pH quicker and improved silage parameters early in the fermentation compared with E. faecium, the commercial inoculant, and control treatments. When combined with a commercial inoculant, S. bovis lowered pH more quickly than the commercial inoculant alone and E. faecium plus commercial inoculant. At 40 days, S. bovis combination had lower pH and ammonia nitrogen and acetate contents than the E. faecium combination. Starch in the silage was not utilized by S. bovis as had been anticipated. Results indicate that S. bovis was more effective than E. faecium as a silage inoculant and could enhance a commercial inoculant on low-dry-matter alfalfa.
TI  - Enumeration by a miniaturized method of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis and enterococci as indicators of the origin of faecal pollution of waters.
AB  - Counts of Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci were made on faecal specimens from human and animal origin and urban raw sewage waters, with microtiter plates containing selective substances. Escherichia coli was more numerous than faecal streptococci and enterococci in 80% of the samples regardless of the origin. Consequently the use of the ratio E. coli/faecal streptococci to distinguish human from animal origin of faecal pollution is questionable. Enterococcus faecalis was predominant in human and poultry faeces, Streptococcus bovis was typical of the bovine faeces and to a lesser extent also of pig faeces whereas Enterococcus durans, Ent. hirae and Ent. faecium did not characterize any faecal source. Streptococcus bovis could be distinguished in the microtiter plate by its inability to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in the medium.
TI  - [Group D streptococci and enterococci: identification, sensitivity to antibiotics and a study of the high level resistance to aminosides (Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis)].
AB  - 197 strains of enterococcus and group D Streptococcus were isolated from human material at Charles Nicolle Hospital (Tunis) and identified by biochemical tests: 174, Enterococcus faecalis, 6 Enterococcus faecium, 2 Enterococcus durans and 15 Streptococcus bovis. The sensitivity to antibiotics was studied: all Enterococcus faecium were resistant at least to one antibiotic, 15% of Enterococcus faecalis were sensitive for all antibiotics tested the other species were frequently sensitive. High level resistance to aminoglycosides were frequent in Enterococcus faecalis 40%: among these strains high level resistance to gentamicin accounts for 12% and 18 frequently associated with resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin, this situation present therapeutic problems in case of severe infection.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of Vitek gram-positive identification system and API Rapid Strep system for identification of Streptococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  - The Vitek Gram-positive identification system (GPI, Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) and the API Rapid Strep system (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY) were evaluated for species identification of streptococci isolated from bovine mammary glands and compared to conventional biochemical methods. A total of 144 strains including Streptococcus uberis (60), S. dysgalactiae (32), S. agalactiae (15), S. bovis (15), Enterococcus faecium (10) and Ent. faecalis (12) were evaluated. All reference strains were identified correctly by both systems. Vitek GPI card system identified 94.4% of strains, including 95% of S. uberis, 93.8% of S. dygalactiae, 93.3% of S. agalactiae and S. bovis II, 90% of Ent. faecium and 100% of Ent. faecalis. Majority of strains were identified with a 90-99% level of confidence, with an average of 8 h needed for identification. The API Rapid Strep system identified 96.5% of strains correctly, including 95% of S. 96.9% of S. dysgalactiae, 93.3% of S. agalactiae, and 100% of S. bovis II, Ent. faecium, and Ent. faecalis. Majority of strains were identified with excellent level of identification. With the exception of S. uberis, most strains were identified at 4 h of incubation.
TI  - The survival of streptococci and enterococci in animal feed and on straw with particular reference to Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - The survival of Streptococcus uberis, Strep. bovis, Enterococcus faecalis spp. faecalis and Ent. faecium in animal feed and on wheat straw was studied for one month. Streptococcus bovis survived the best in feed and Strep. uberis the worst while on straw Ent. faecium was the most resilient species and there was little to choose between the other three. The recovery of all species, excepting Strep. bovis, on selective and non-selective agar was comparable. The growth of Strep. bovis, on the other hand, was inhibited on both Edward's medium and inulin agar.
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Role of immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative and enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Serum samples from patients with endocarditis and septicaemia due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus sanguis were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all four species. In E faecalis endocarditis there was a strong IgM response to E faecalis antigenic bands of 112, 88-90, and 45-47 Kd and a strong IgG response to 88-90 and 45-47 Kd bands. In E faecium endocarditis there was a pronounced IgG response to an E faecium band of 82-90 Kd. For S bovis endocarditis, there was a strong IgG response to several components of S bovis including bands of 66, 58, 52 and 4 Kd. For S sanguis, there was a strong IgG response to bands of 80-82, 76, 60 and 45 Kd. These patterns of antibody production were absent in patients with uncomplicated septicaemia and in controls. The delineation of these patterns enabled confirmation of the final diagnosis in seven patients initially suspected of having culture negative endocarditis.
TI  - Comparative survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine water.
AB  - The survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Escherichia coli,  Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, AP17 and AQ62, was examined in estuarine water. Each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. Cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. Recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. None of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. Three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. Survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant AQ62, resistant Escherichia coli less than sensitive Escherichia coli less than resistant AP17 less than resistant Enterococcus faecium less than sensitive AP17, sensitive and resistant S. equinus less than sensitive and resistant Enterococcus faecalis, sensitive Enterococcus faecium. The results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than Escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. Moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic LY146032 was generally four-fold greater (MIC 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. Enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, group B and viridans streptococci, and Corynebacterium group J-K isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of LY146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. Unlike vancomycin, LY146032 was bactericidal for Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes. Due to its bactericidal properties LY146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Cell surface hydrophobicity of group D and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  - Sixty-three strains of Group D streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and API Strep. Streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. constellatus (S. milleri). One of the two isolates of S. faecium was a contamination. The reported increasing frequency of this organism and other Group D and viridans streptococci as well as the association of S. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. Pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (SAT) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. In the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. The surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.
TI  - Studies on the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in group D streptococci.
AB  - Six penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) were detected in clinical isolates of each one of three group D streptococci: Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis and S. faecium. When examined in whole organisms, the PBPs of S. faecium, the most penicillin-resistant species of group D streptococci, generally had lower affinities for the antibiotic than those of S. faecalis (intermediate penicillin resistance), which in turn were of lower affinity than those of S. bovis (penicillin-sensitive). On the other hand, no quantitative correlation could be established between the binding of penicillin to any one PBP or group of PBPs, and the penicillin MIC value for the corresponding micro-organism. Examination of the amounts of antibiotic bound and the rates of binding to PBPs of equal numbers of protoplasts and whole bacteria of S. faecalis and S. faecium, indicated that there was no permeability barrier to benzylpenicillin in the cell walls of these species. The lower antibacterial effectiveness of cephalothin compared with ampicillin in group D streptococci was paralleled by the higher concentrations of cephalothin needed in competition assays to inhibit the lower molecular size PBPs of these bacteria.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - Identification of group D streptococci by SeroSTAT.
AB  - Clinical isolates of group D streptococci presumptively identified by biochemical methods were grouped by latex agglutination using a commercially prepared reagent specifically sensitized with group D antiserum (SeroSTAT; Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskeville, R.I.). Streptococcus species tested included S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. durans, S. avium, S. bovis, and S. equinus. Colonies of the organism to be tested were picked from agar plates, emulsified in a drop of glycine-buffered saline on a slide, and mixed with a drop of the latex reagent. Macroscopic agglutination occurred within 60 s. A total of 115 isolates of group D streptococci were tested; 103 (89.6%) gave positive reactions with SeroSTAT. Twelve strains failed to react with the latex reagent; these 12 strains also gave negative results with group D antiserum when tested by the Lancefield method. Two of 14 group A streptococci also reacted with the SeroSTAT group D reagent; after trypsinization, the cross-reaction was eliminated. Group B streptococci, viridans group streptococci, anaerobic streptococci, and staphylococci all gave negative reactions with the SeroSTAT reagent. The SeroSTAT reagent is a useful diagnostic tool for the prompt identification of enterococcal and non-enterococcal group D streptococci.
TI  - [Observations on the fecal streptococcal flora in carnivorous domestic animals (author's transl)].
AB  - From 1200 feces-samples streaks of carnivorous domestic animals (1027 from dogs,  173 from cats) 744 streptococci-strains were isolated and differentiated. 87% proved their, self to be streptococcus group D/enterococcus, 13% falled to 11 others species, much-numerous represented streptococci of Viridans-group (Sc. MG, Sc. milleri, Sc. salivarius, Sc. viridans), Sc. group G (beta-hemolytic biotypes) and Sc. lactis (group N). Among the group D-spezies the most showed species at dogs was Sc. bovis (35%), retinued by Sc. faecium and Sc. durans (ever about 18%) and the both Sc.-faecalis-sub-spezies var. liquefaciens and var. faecalis (ever about 8%). At cats, the relation respecting to group D-shares, especially of Sc. bovis, were strong varying. All together an interesting survey on the qualitative composition of the streptococcal flora in dog- and cat-intestine was obtained.
TI  - The distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups D and N.
AB  - The isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups D and N were investigated. Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. Menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in S. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and S. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of S. cremoris, S. cremoris subsp. alactosus, S. lactis and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. Strains of S. avium, S. bovis, S. durans, S. equinus, S. faecium, S. raffinolactis and S. suis contained neither menaquinones nor ubiquinones. The isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
TI  - Untyped forms of faecal streptococci in Egyptian sewage and Nile water.
AB  - When the thallous-azide agar medium was used a higher incidence of pure faecal streptococci recovery was recorded especially from slightly polluted vehicles such as river water than on the standard M-enterococcus agar medium. In addition, a thallous-azide combination at pH 6.5 was used successfully for the primary isolation of Str. faecalis and its two variants. Results of biochemical tests of 274 faecal streptococci isolates showed that 20% belonged to Str. faecalis and its two variants as well as Str. durans, Str. faecium and Str. equinus. Thirty-eight percent of the isolated strains were classified as atypical I, II, III, and V previously designated by COOPER and RAMADAN (1955) as well as the unclassified group of RAMADAN et al. (1972). While the remaining 42% were found to belong to seven different categories (SALEH 1976 and 1977). The correlation between four differential tests used for defining the source of faecal streptococci isolates was discussed.
TI  - Carriage of group D streptococci in the human bowel.
AB  - Sixty faecal samples, 39 from adults and 21 from neonates, were investigated by means of a simple scheme to isolate and identify any group D streptococci present. A number of differences were found between the two groups. Group D streptococci were absent from 43% of the neonates compared with only 13% of the adults; Streptococcus bovis was commoner in the neonates (23.8%) than in the adults (5%), and Streptococcus faecium was not isolated from any of the infant samples although it was common in the adult samples (25%). The viable counts of Strep. faecium were found to be, on average, 100-fold lower than those of Streptococcus faecalis. The methods and results are discussed with reference to the clinical significance of group D streptococci, especially in bacterial endocarditis and carcinoma of the colon.
TI  - Incidence and relationship of group D streptococci with other indicator organisms in meats.
AB  - Raw and processed meats were analyzed for presumptive group D streptococci using  KF streptococcus agar. Counts were compared with coliform, presumptive Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriaceae counts but no meaningful relationships were observed. Results indicated that group D streptococci and E. coli type I were principally contaminants from the packing plant, rather than at retail level. The predominating group D streptococcus in both beef and pork cuts was Streptococcus faecalis, while in processed meat (bologna), the predominating group D streptococci were Streptococcus faecium var. durans and Streptococcus faecium. Streptococcus bovis was not detected among the isolates from any meat samples. Marked differences were noted in numbers of group D streptococci in processed meat from different manufacturers. The results did not support the use of group D streptococci as alternative indicator organisms for meats. However, the association of group D streptococci with packing plant contamination may prove to be of value.
TI  - Use of pyruvate fermentation compared with tetrazolium reduction in the differentiation of group D streptococci.
AB  - The reduction of 2, 3, 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride in the original medium of  Barnes (Journal of General Microbiology, 14, 57, 1956), and in a modified medium, was compared with the ability to ferment pyruvate as a means of separating Streptococcus faecalis from all other group D streptococci. The tetrazolium reduction test gave an occasional negative reaction with Str. faecalis strains. In addition, a number of strains gave a weakly positive reaction in the test, as did some strains of Str. faecium and Str. bovis. With some batches of tetrazolium, these weak reactions with Str. faecalis were so frequent that interpretation of the results was difficult. On the other hand, all Str. faecalis strains, and no other group D streptococci, gave a positive pyruvate-fermentation reaction in 48 hours.
TI  - Generation rates of faecal streptococci in various vehicles.
AB  - Potassium tellurite media gave the highest detrimental effects on the generation  number of all tested faecal streptococci species. This applies to all investigated vehicles. However, drastic tellurite effects became more conspicuous with certain vehicles than with others. This is particularly true with acid and alkaline foods and water, especially with strains like Streptococcus bovis, Str. faecium, and Str. durans. Again, tellurite becomes more influencial with regard to old cells rather than young cells in the logarithmic phase. On the other hand, the use of thallous acetate as a concentration agent secured better results than either the tellurite or azide almost with all tested vehicles. Yet, sodium azide may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between tellurite and thallous acetate in terms of vehicles, Streptococcus species, and age of pollution. A lower number of generation resulted with all tested faecal streptococci species, using liquid media bearing more than one concentrating agent. This applied to water and milk examination.
TI  - Teichoic acids of group D streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (Streptococcus suis).
AB  - Immunoelectrophoresis revealed in phenol extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium a mixture of free and lipid-bound teichoic acids, both reactive with Group D antisera. In phenol extracts from S. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with Group D antiserum, was seen. This difference probably accounts for the low yield of Group D antigen from S. suis as compared with S. faecalis and S. faecium when heating at pH 2 is used for extraction. When phenol is used good yields are obtained from S. suis as well as from S. faecalis and S. faecium. Lipoteichoic acids from S. faecalis and S. faecium have a backbone structure the same as or similar to that of Group A streptococcal teichoic acid. Lipoteichoic acid from S. suis has a structure differing from that of S. faecalis and S. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. Precipitation reactions between S. suis lipoteichoic acid and Group D antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. Reactions between S. bovis phenol extracts and some Group D antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium were not. This may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from S. suis and S. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of S. faecalis.
TI  - Distribution of group D streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated waters. Media used to characterize and speciate group D streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. Due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS) in river water samples, the FC/FS ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. High concentrations of FC and FS from sediment samples gave more credible FC/FS ratios. The actual distribution of group D streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. High concentrations of all division II species (S. faecium, S. faecium var. casseliflavus, and S. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with S. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. Low concentrations of division I group D streptococci (S. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division III group D streptococci (S. bovis and S. equinus) was made.
TI  - Membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  - A membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. The procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. The procedure (mE) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. Essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium. Neither S. bovis, S. equinus, S. mitis, nor S. salivarius grew on the medium. The selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 C. About 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact, identified as enterococci. Plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. Verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the mE procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the KF method by one order of magnitude.
