TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria toward their selection as a source of chicken probiotic.
AB  == in this study, 332 lactic acid bacteria of broiler gut origin were investigated as putative probiotic candidates. sixty-two bacteria showed the highest aggregation while showing antibacterial effects against salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, and escherichia coli o78:k80. enzymatic activities of the selected bacteria were examined. no lipase activity was detected, but all of them showed almost similar proteolytic activities. however, they had different amylase and phytase activities. four of the 62 bacterial strains were selected as a result of aggregation and amylase tests. they were chosen for the following attributes: high cell surface hydrophobicity, co-aggregation, and resistance to bile salts and also acidic conditions. finally, lactobacillus crispatus was selected as a source of potential probiotic because of its predominant characteristics in comparison to the other isolated strains from the gastrointestinal tract of chickens. this study has provided a good arrangement of rapid methods for screening a high number of bacteria: a series of beneficial tests that are used together for the first time on chickens, and not any other animals.

TI  == the s-layer proteins of lactobacillus crispatus strain zj001 is responsible for competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == lactobacillus crispatus zj001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16s rrna gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (s-layer). the characteristics of l. crispatus zj001 were compared to lactobacillus acidophilus  atcc 4356 from the same genus which also produces the s-layer proteins. the strain zj001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over l. acidophilus atcc 4356. sds-page analysis of cell  surface proteins revealed the presence of s-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kda in l. crispatus zj001. removal of the s-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to hela cells. the functional role of the s-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the s-layer protein. the s-layer proteins from l. crispatus zj001 inhibited adhesion of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7  to hela cells. these results suggest that l. crispatus zj001 possesses probiotic  properties and the s-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive  exclusion of pathogens to hela cells.

TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB  == thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and  bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l.  reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a  strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.

TI  == in vitro adhesion of an avian pathogenic escherichia coli o78 strain to surfaces  of the chicken intestinal tract and to ileal mucus.
AB  == the role of fimbria in adherence of an avian pathogenic escherichia coli (apec) o78 strain 789 to chicken intestine was studied. bacterial adhesion to tissue sections representing the regions within the chicken intestinal tract was determined by using immunohistochemical methods. e. coli 789 grown to express the type 1 fimbria adhered efficiently to the crop epithelium, to the lamina propria  of intestinal villi, and to the apical surfaces of both the mature as well as the crypt-located enterocytes in intestinal villi, whereas no adhesion to mucus-producing goblet cells was detected. the adhesion was inhibited by mannoside and the role of type 1 fimbriae in the observed adhesion was confirmed  with a recombinant strain expressing type 1 fimbriae genes cloned from e. coli and salmonella enterica. e. coli 789 strain grown to favor ac/i fimbriae expression as well as the recombinant e. coli strain expressing the fac genes adhered to goblet cells but only poorly to the other epithelial sites. e. coli strain 789 as well as s. enterica serovar typhimurium ir715 and s. enterica serovar enteriditis tn2 strains were able to multiply in ileal mucus medium. the  type 1 fimbria expressing bacteria adhered to the ileal mucus, whereas the ac/i fimbriated strains showed poor adherence to the mucus. the adhesion of e. coli 789 onto the crop epithelium and the follicle associated epithelium of the chicken ileum was efficiently inhibited by an adhesive strain st1 of lactobacillus crispatus isolated from chicken, whereas poor inhibition of e. coli adherence was observed with the weakly adhesive l. crispatus strain 134mi. the type 1 fimbriae may be important in colonization of the chicken intestine by apec and salmonella.

TI  == competitive exclusion of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis by lactobacillus crispatus and clostridium lactatifermentans in a sequencing fed-batch culture.
AB  == competitive exclusion of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis by a mixed culture of lactobacillus crispatus and clostridium lactatifermentans was studied  in a sequencing fed-batch reactor mimicking the cecal ecophysiology of broiler chickens. growth of serovar enteritidis was inhibited by a mixed culture of l. crispatus and c. lactatifermentans at ph 5.8 but not by a monoculture of l. crispatus at the same ph. moreover, experiments performed at ph 7.0 did not show  growth inhibition of serovar enteritidis. l. crispatus fermented lactose to lactate, and c. lactatifermentans fermented the lactate to acetate and propionate in a mixed culture of l. crispatus and c. lactatifermentans growing on lactose. in contrast, only lactate was produced from lactose by a monoculture of l. crispatus. at ph 5.8 considerable concentrations of acetate and propionate were present as undissociated acids, whereas only trace levels of undissociated lactate were present at ph 5.8 due to the low pk(a) of lactate. at ph 7.0 all three acids were present in their dissociated forms. we conclude that a mixed culture of l. crispatus and c. lactatifermentans inhibits growth of serovar enteritidis under cecal growth conditions. the undissociated forms of acetate and propionate produced in the mixed culture inhibited the growth of serovar enteritidis.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of food-borne pathogens to caco-2 cells by lactobacillus strains.
AB  == aims: to select adhesive strains among strains of lactobacillus and to apply them to inhibit adhesion of food-borne pathogens. methods and results: twelve lactobacillus strains (10 from intestine) were examined for adhesion using caco-2 cell cultures. the two most adhesive strains, lactobacillus crispatus jcm 8779 and lact. reuteri jcm 1081, were used to test antiadhesion activity against enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and enterococcus faecalis strains. adhesion of the pathogens was inhibited by both lactobacillus strains. adhesion of ent. faecalis was especially strongly inhibited by jcm 8779. although antimicrobial activity was not detected in the culture supernatant fluid by agar well diffusion assay, the supernatant fluid obtained from the harvested jcm 8779 cell suspension showed bactericidal activity against ent. faecalis. conclusion: the strong antiadhesion activity of jcm 8779 against ent. faecalis appears to be due to the combined effect of both bactericidal activity and competition for attachment site. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report that lact. crispatus produces a bactericidal substance.
