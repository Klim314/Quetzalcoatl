TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == molecular identification and quantification of lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented dairy foods of russia.
AB  == russian traditional fermented dairy foods have been consumed for thousands of years. however, little research has focused on exploiting lactic acid bacteria (lab) resources and analyzing the lab composition of russian traditional fermented dairy foods. in the present study, we cultured lab isolated from fermented mare and cow milks, sour cream, and cheese collected from kalmykiya, buryats, and tuva regions of russia. seven lactobacillus species and the bifidobacterium genus were quantified by quantitative pcr. the lab counts in these samples ranged from 3.18 to 9.77 log cfu/ml (or per gram). in total, 599 lab strains were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. the identified lab belonged to 7 genera and 30 species by 16s  rrna and mure gene sequencing and multiplex pcr assay. the predominant lab isolates were lactobacillus helveticus (176 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum  (63 strains), which represented 39.9% of all isolates. the quantitative pcr results revealed that counts of 7 lactobacilli species and bifidobacterium spp. of 30 fermented cow milk samples ranged from 1.19 +/- 0.34 (lactobacillus helveticus in tuva) to 8.09 +/- 0.71 (lactobacillus acidophilus in kalmykiya) log cfu/ml of fermented cow milk (mean +/- standard error). the numbers of bifidobacterium spp., lb. plantarum, lb. helveticus, and lb. acidophilus revealed no significant difference between the 3 regions; nevertheless, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus exhibited different degrees of variation across 3 regions. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of russia have complex compositions of lab species. the diversity of lab might be related to the type of fermented dairy product, geographical origin, and manufacturing process.

TI  == fermented fruits and vegetables of asia: a potential source of probiotics.
AB  == as world population increases, lactic acid fermentation is expected to become an  important role in preserving fresh vegetables, fruits, and other food items for feeding humanity in developing countries. however, several fermented fruits and vegetables products (sauerkraut, kimchi, gundruk, khalpi, sinki, etc.) have a long history in human nutrition from ancient ages and are associated with the several social aspects of different communities. among the food items, fruits and vegetables are easily perishable commodities due to their high water activity and nutritive values. these conditions are more critical in tropical and subtropical  countries which favour the growth of spoilage causing microorganisms. lactic acid fermentation increases shelf life of fruits and vegetables and also enhances several beneficial properties, including nutritive value and flavours, and reduces toxicity. fermented fruits and vegetables can be used as a potential source of probiotics as they harbour several lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, l. pentosus, l. brevis, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, leuconostoc fallax, and l. mesenteroides. as a whole, the traditionally fermented fruits and vegetables not only serve as food supplements but also attribute towards health benefits. this review aims to describe some important asian fermented fruits and vegetables and their significance as a potential source of probiotics.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == effect of the bread-making process on zearalenone levels.
AB  == the effects of the bread-making process including fermentation with saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus fermentum) and baking at 200 degrees c on zearalenone (zea) levels were investigated. standard solutions of zea were added to flour and then loaves of bread were prepared. sourdough and  three types of yeast including active dry yeast, instant dry yeast and compressed yeast were used for the fermentation of dough. zea levels in flour, dough and bread were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection after extraction and clean-up on an immunoaffinity column. the highest reduction in levels of zea was  found in the first fermentation (first proof), while the lowest reduction was observed in the baking stage. in addition, the results showed that compressed yeast had the maximum reduction potential on zea levels even at the baking stage.

TI  == can lactobacillus fermentum lf10 and lactobacillus acidophilus la02 in a slow-release vaginal product be useful for prevention of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis?: a clinical study.
AB  == objective: to assess the effectiveness of the association of 2 specific strains,  lactobacillus fermentum lf10 (dsm 19187) and lactobacillus acidophilus la02 (dsm  21717), specifically formulated in slow-release effervescent tablets, in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. study design: the study was a clinical trial of 58 women diagnosed with recurrent vvc (>/=4 culture-confirmed episodes in a 12-mo period). all patients were given 200 mg of fluconazole orally as an induction dose for 3 alternate days during the first treatment week. afterward, the patients were given a new product formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets  containing at least 0.4 billion live cells of each of lactobacillus l. fermentum  lf10 and l. acidophilus la02 (first phase of the prophylactic period), on alternate days for 10 consecutive nights. patients who were still free of symptoms were given 1 vaginal tablet every week for the next 10 weeks (second phase of the prophylactic period). patients asymptomatic after the total duration of the observation phase (7 mo) were considered as responders. results: during the second 10-week prophylactic phase, 49 of 57 (86.0%) patients remained free of clinical recurrence, whereas symptomatic vvc occurred in 8 patients (14.0%). during the 7-month follow-up, 42 patients of 49 (85.7%) were symptom free at the  end of the protocol, whereas clinical recurrences occurred in 7 women (14.3%). overall, 42 of 58 women enrolled in the study (72.4%) experienced no clinical recurrence throughout the 7-month observation phase (responders). conclusions: this study strengthens the evidence supporting the use of specific lactobacilli with well-demonstrated activities associated with the creation and maintenance of a vaginal biofilm that hinders the persistence of an infection caused by candida.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == effects of probiotics on the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis: a review.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common cause of genital discomfort in women in reproductive ages, which causes many complications. bacterial vaginosis  is usually treated by metronidazole and clindamycin. however, this protocol does  not prevent its recurrence, which is a main complaint of the patients. the number of lactobacilli in the vagina of women with bv is significantly lower than that in healthy women. hence, efforts have been made to normalize vaginal flora by oral or vaginal administration of lactobacilli. the objective of the present study was to review clinical evidences available regarding the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of bv. materials and methods: published randomized controlled trials were searched in pubmed, science direct, and the cochrane database between 1990 and 2011. search terms included bacterial  vaginosis, urinary tract infection, lactobacillus, and probiotics. results: orally consumed probiotics are believed to ascend to the vaginal tract after they are excreted from the rectum; vaginal administration allows for direct replacement of the probiotics for unhealthy vaginal microbiota and occupation of  specific adhesion sites at the epithelial surface of the urinary tract, which consequently results in maintenance of a low ph and production of antimicrobial substances like acids and hydrogen peroxide. receiving lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1, and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 at a dose of at least 10 cfu/day for 2 months has been shown to present the patients with better  results. conclusions: although the results of different studies are controversial, most studies have been in favor of the probiotics in the prevention or treatment of bv, and no adverse effects have been reported. therefore, it may be helpful to recommend daily consumption of probiotic products to improve public health among women.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == effect of immersion and inoculation in ovo of lactobacillus spp. in embryonated chicken eggs in the prevention of salmonella enteritidis after hatch.
AB  == the protection level against salmonella enteritidis was evaluated in chickens after in ovo treatment with different species of lactobacillus spp. inoculated into the air cell or by immersion in broth culture. two hundred forty embryonated eggs were distributed into 8 groups, corresponding to treatments with lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, and control. on d 18 of incubation, 4 groups were inoculated with 0.1 ml of inoculum  in the air cell and 4 groups were immersed for 3 min in culture of each treatment. two days after hatching, 0.5 ml of salmonella enteritidis culture was  inoculated by the intraesophageal route. on d 5 of life, the chicks were euthanized and the ceca were processed to obtain salmonella enteritidis counts. there was no decrease in salmonella enteritidis colonization of chick ceca, regardless of treatment or route of administration. lactobacillus spp. samples used in the treatment showed no probiotic potential in chicks when inoculated in  ovo, in relation to salmonella enteritidis inhibition in poultry ceca.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == comparative in vitro inhibition of urinary tract pathogens by single- and multi-strain probiotics.
AB  == purpose: multi-species probiotic preparations have been suggested as having a wide spectrum of application, although few studies have compared their efficacy with that of individual component strains at equal concentrations. we therefore tested the ability of 4 single probiotics and 4 probiotic mixtures to inhibit the urinary tract pathogens escherichia coli nctc 9001 and enterococcus faecalis nctc 00775. methods: we used an agar spot test to test the ability of viable cells to  inhibit pathogens, while a broth inhibition assay was used to assess inhibition by cell-free probiotic supernatants in both ph-neutralised and non-neutralised forms. results: in the agar spot test, all probiotic treatments showed inhibition, l. acidophilus was the most inhibitory single strain against e. faecalis, l. fermentum the most inhibitory against e. coli. a commercially available mixture of 14 strains (bio-kult((r))) was the most effective mixture, against e. faecalis, the 3-lactobacillus mixture the most inhibitory against e. coli. mixtures were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. in the broth inhibition assays, all probiotic supernatants inhibited both pathogens when ph was not controlled, with only 2 treatments causing inhibition at a neutral ph. conclusions: both viable cells of probiotics and supernatants of probiotic cultures were able to inhibit growth of two urinary tract pathogens. probiotic mixtures prevented the growth of urinary tract pathogens but were not significantly more inhibitory than single strains. probiotics appear to produce metabolites that are inhibitory towards urinary tract pathogens. probiotics display potential to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections via inhibition of colonisation.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == alleviating effects of lactobacillus strains on pathogenic vibrio parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fluid accumulation in the mouse model.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus strains against vibrio parahaemolyticus causing gastroenteritis. six-week-old icr mice were pretreated with four lactobacillus strains at three dosages, and then challenged with v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 (serotype o3:k6). the results showed that v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 caused severe intestinal fluid accumulation (fa)  and villi damage in control mice which were pretreated with phosphate-buffered saline. in contrast, significant alleviation of fa was seen in mice pretreated by with a high dose of lactobacillus strains (p < 0.05, n = 6) but not in mice that  received low-dose pretreatments. among middle-dose treatments, two highly adhesive strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus h15 and lactobacillus brevis y29-4, significantly decreased intestinal fa and villi damage in treated mice (p < 0.05). two low-adhesive strains, lactobacillus acidophilus y14-3 and lactobacillus fermentum f16-6, had no significant alleviating effects. at the same dosing levels, no significant differences in fa were observed in mice pretreated with strains with similar adhesive abilities but different antagonistic activities. our findings suggest that lactobacillus strains can alleviate v. parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fa in mice, and the doses required for in vivo efficacy depend more on adhesive ability than on the antibacterial activity of strains.

TI  == effectiveness of the association of 2 probiotic strains formulated in a slow release vaginal product, in women affected by vulvovaginal candidiasis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) is the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis, and it is diagnosed in up to 40% of women with vaginal complaints in the primary care setting. among candida spp., candida  albicans is the most common infectious agent. the treatment of choice for uncomplicated vvc is achieved with single-dose or short-course therapy in over 90% of cases. several topical and oral drugs are available, without evidence for  superiority of any agent or route of administration. in any case, most classic treatments are unable to significantly offer a protection against possible recurrences. in recent years, probiotics are emerging as a new strategy to counteract vvc. in fact, they are well known for their ability to lower intravaginal ph, thus establishing a barrier effect against many types of yeasts. some strains are also able to exert additional and more focused antagonistic activities mediated by specific molecules such as hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. for example, lactobacillus fermentum lf5 (cncm i-789) was successfully tested in 4 human trials involving a total of 340 women reporting vvc at enrollment. in any case, the way used to deliver probiotics to the vaginal environment represents a crucial point. the aim of this work was to first select  1 or more probiotic strains in vitro with an antagonistic activity on candida yeasts and then to perform an in vivo human pilot study using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. methods: for this purpose, 2 probiotic strains probiotical s.p.a (italy) were selected based on their strong in vitro inhibition activity toward 4 particular candida species, namely c. albicans, candida glabrata, candida parapsilosis, and candida krusei and subsequently tested in a human intervention pilot trial involving 30 women with vvc. the probiotics used, l. fermentum lf10 (dsm 19187) and lactobacillus acidophilus la02 (dsm 21717), were administered by means of slow release effervescent vaginal tablets (acticand 30 product). the main endpoint was the assessment of the establishment and maintenance of a barrier effect against candida yeasts in women suffering from vvc. thirty female subjects who were diagnosed with vvc by both microscopic examination and yeast culture were enrolled in the study and directed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a medical examination of each patient was performed at enrollment (d(0)), at the end of the first 4 weeks of treatment (d(2)(8)), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d(5)(6)). the visual and microscopic examination was always accompanied by microbiological analyses of vaginal swabs to assess the presence of candida. a statistical comparison was made between d(2)(8), or d(5)(6), and d0, and between d(5)(6) and d(2)(8) to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: the administration of the product acticand 30 was able to significantly solve candida yeast symptoms after 28 days in 26 patients out of 30 (corresponding to 86.6%, p<0.001). at the  end of the second month, recurrences were recorded, albeit not particularly serious, in only 3 out of 26 patients (11.5%, p=0.083) who were found to have fully healed at the end of the first month of treatment. this is a further confirmation of the long-term barrier effect exerted by the product. conclusions: vvc has a very high incidence as 70% to 75% of women report at least 1 episode during the life. many treatments are currently available but, despite a relatively high effectiveness in the relief of symptoms typically associated with acute infections, they are generally unable to offer a long-term protective barrier against possible recurrences. this study demonstrated the ability of acticand 30 to not only solve candida infections in a very high percentage of women, but also to exert a long-term physiological defense due to the colonization of vaginal microbiota and adhesion of the mucosa to the epithelial cells. the special formulation of acticand 30, consisting of slow release effervescent vaginal tablets, is able to mediate 2 types of barrier effects, the  first represented by the formation of an anaerobic environment due to the release of co(2) and the second guaranteed by the colonization and adhesion to the vaginal epithelium of the 2 probiotics l. fermentum lf10 and l. acidophilus la02.

AB  == objective: the objective was to analyse the ability of lactobacillus strains isolated from supragingival plaque of subjects with hyposalivation and from healthy controls to ferment sugars and sugar alcohols. material and methods: fifty strains isolated from interproximal plaque from subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (25 strains), subjects with primary sjogren's syndrome (16 strains) and from subjects with normal salivary secretion rate (9 strains) were tested. growth and ph were determined after 24 and 48 h of anaerobic incubation in vials containing basal media with 1 % of glucose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol or xylitol. results: no differences between strains isolated from hyposalivated subjects and controls were detected. all strains lowered the ph to <5.0 from fructose and the majority of the strains from glucose and sucrose. a ph of <5.5 was seen for 52 % of the strains using mannitol, 50 % using sorbitol and 36 % using xylitol. the ability to produce acids from sugars and sugar alcohols was highest among strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei and lowest among lactobacillus fermentum strains. conclusion: a large number of lactobacillus strains are able to ferment not only sugars but also the sugar substitutes mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol to ph levels critical for enamel demineralisation. clinical relevance: our findings suggest that products containing mannitol, sorbitol and/or xylitol may contribute to the acidogenic potential of the dental  plaque and especially in hyposalivated subjects with high numbers of lactobacilli.

TI  == comparative meta-analysis of the effect of lactobacillus species on weight gain in humans and animals.
AB  == background: obesity is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. in order to clarify the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics (lcp) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. we intended to assess effects by lactobacillus species. methods: a broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. we included randomized controlled  trials (rcts) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. we primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. data were extracted independently by two authors. results were pooled by host and by lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (smds). results: we identified and included 17 rcts in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (smd 0.15; 95% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). results were consistent in humans and animals. lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and lactobacillus gasseri was associated with weight  loss both in obese humans and in animals. conclusions: different lactobacillus species are associated different effects on weight change that are host-specific. further studies are needed to clarify the role of lactobacillus species in the human energy harvest and weight regulation. attention should be drawn to the potential effects of commonly marketed lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight gain.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of metabolites from lactobacillus strains on candida species implicated in candida vaginitis.
AB  == background: research from developing countries, such as nigeria, on lactobacillus species in the female urogenital tract and their role as a barrier to vaginal infection is limited. therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical biotherapeutic potential of indigenous lactobacillus species. methods: antimicrobial metabolites production were characterised using simple and easily reproducible qualitative and quantitative methods. the in vitro inhibitory effect of lactobacillus antimicrobials on vulvovaginal candidiasis-associated candida species was investigated using modified agar spot and agar well-diffusion methods. results: the maximum levels of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl from 20 vaginal lactobacillus strains from diseased subjects were 1.46 mg/l, 1.36 mmol/l, and 1.72 mg/l respectively. from the 4 healthy subjects, the maximum level of lactic acid was 1.08 mg/l; hydrogen peroxide, 1.36 mmol/l; and diacetyl, 0.86 mg/l. the maximum productions of these substances occurred between 72 and 120 hours of incubation. the in vitro antagonistic activities of vaginal l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. casei, l. delbrueckii,  and l. jensenii from diseased subjects inhibited a maximum of 5.71% of the 35 candida species tested, while vaginal l. acidophilus and l. plantarum from healthy subjects inhibited between 57.1% and 68.6% of candida species in vitro. conclusion: antimicrobial-producing lactobacilli can be considered as adjunct biotherapeutic candidates for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

TI  == strain dependent protection conferred by lactobacillus spp. administered orally with a salmonella typhimurium vaccine in a murine challenge model.
AB  == consumption of lactobacillus spp. has been shown to enhance immune responses in mice. this study examined the immuno-adjuvant capacity of two strains: lactobacillus acidophilus l10 and lactobacillus fermentum pc2, in the induction of protective humoral immunity in a salmonella typhimurium vaccine challenge model. briefly, balb/c mice were divided into four groups. three groups of mice received s. typhimurium vaccine (10(8) colony forming units (cfu) per dose) on days 0 and 14. in addition to the vaccine, five doses (10(8) cfu per dose) of either l. acidophilus l10 or l. fermentum pc2 were also administered to a group.  all mice were challenged with viable s. typhimurium on day 28. on day 10 post challenge, the study was terminated and microbial and immunological parameters were assessed. mice dosed with l. fermentum pc2 in addition to the vaccine had a  significantly enhanced s. typhimurium humoral response. the mice in this group had high levels of lactobacilli in the feces and in association with the peyer's  patches, no detectable levels of either lactobacilli or s. typhimurium in the spleen, and no detectable weight loss. mice given l. acidophilus l10 with the vaccine were unable to exhibit elevated s. typhimurium specific humoral responses. however, there was no detectable s. typhimurium in the spleens of this group. interestingly, translocation of lactobacilli into the spleen was observed  as well as a slight weight loss was noted in mice that received the l. acidophilus l10 with the vaccine. this study shows that, the l. fermentum pc2 had a greater capacity than the l. acidophilus l10 to act as an oral adjuvant in a s. typhimurium oral vaccine program and afforded greater protection against a live s. typhimurium challenge.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == differential targeting of the e-cadherin/beta-catenin complex by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli improves epithelial barrier function.
AB  == the intestinal ecosystem is balanced by dynamic interactions between resident and incoming microbes, the gastrointestinal barrier, and the mucosal immune system. however, in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), where the integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier is compromised, resident microbes contribute to the development and perpetuation of inflammation and disease. probiotic bacteria  have been shown to exert beneficial effects, e.g., enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. however, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are only poorly understood. here, we comparatively investigated the effects of four probiotic lactobacilli, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, and l. rhamnosus, in a t84 cell epithelial barrier model. results of dna microarray experiments indicating that lactobacilli modulate the regulation of genes encoding in particular adherence junction proteins such as e-cadherin and beta-catenin were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr).  furthermore, we show that epithelial barrier function is modulated by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli via their effect on adherence junction protein expression and complex formation. in addition, incubation with lactobacilli differentially influences the phosphorylation of adherence junction  proteins and the abundance of protein kinase c (pkc) isoforms such as pkcdelta that thereby positively modulates epithelial barrier function. further insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by these probiotics might also foster the development of novel strategies for the treatment of gastrointestinal  diseases (e.g., ibd).

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == safety and persistence of orally administered human lactobacillus sp. strains in  healthy adults.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and persistence of selected lactobacillus strains in the gastrointestinal tract (git) of healthy adult volunteers after oral consumption of high doses of lactobacilli to identify potential candidates for probiotic and biotechnological applications. in the first phase of the study, nine individuals consumed capsules containing lactobacillus gasseri 177 and e16b7, lactobacillus acidophilus 821-3, lactobacillus paracasei 317 and lactobacillus fermentum 338-1-1 (each daily dose  1x1010 cfu) for 5 consecutive days. data on gut health, blood parameters, and liver and kidney function were collected. the persistence of lactobacillus strains was assessed by culturing combined with arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-pcr) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) on days 0, 5, 8, 10 and 20 from faecal samples. all strains survived gastrointestinal passage and were detected on the 5th day. l. acidophilus 821-3 was detected in four volunteers on the 8th day (4.3 to 7.0 log10 cfu/g) and in two on the 10th day (8.3 and 3.9 log10 cfu/g, respectively). in the second phase  of the study, five additional volunteers consumed l. acidophilus 821-3 (daily 1x1010 cfu) for 5 consecutive days. the strain was subsequently detected in faeces of all individuals using real-time pcr on the 10th day (range 4.6-6.7; median 6.0 log10 cell/g) in both phases of the study for at least 5 days after discontinuation of consumption. the administration of high doses of different lactobacillus strains did not result in any severe adverse effects in git and/or  abnormal values of blood indices. thus, the strain l. acidophilus 821-3 is a promising candidate for probiotic and biotechnological applications. further studies will be performed to confirm the strain persistence and safety in a larger number of individuals.

TI  == enhanced growth of lactobacilli and bioconversion of isoflavones in biotin-supplemented soymilk upon ultrasound-treatment.
AB  == this study aimed at utilizing ultrasound treatment to further enhance the growth  of lactobacilli and their isoflavone bioconversion activities in biotin-supplemented soymilk. strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus bt 1088, l. fermentum bt 8219, l. acidophilus ftdc 8633, l. gasseri ftdc 8131) were treated with ultrasound (30 khz, 100 w) at different amplitudes (20%, 60% and 100%) for 60, 120 and 180 s prior to inoculation and fermentation in biotin-soymilk. the treatment affected the fatty acids chain of the cellular membrane lipid bilayer, as shown by an increased lipid peroxidation (p<0.05). this led to increased membrane fluidity and subsequently, membrane permeability (p<0.05). the permeabilized cellular membranes had facilitated nutrient internalization and subsequent growth enhancement (p<0.05). higher amplitudes and longer durations of the treatment promoted growth of lactobacilli in soymilk, with viable counts exceeding 9 log cfu/ml. the intracellular and extracellular beta-glucosidase specific activities of lactobacilli were also enhanced (p<0.05)  upon ultrasound treatment, leading to increased bioconversion of isoflavones in soymilk, particularly genistin and malonyl genistin to genistein. results from this study show that ultrasound treatment on lactobacilli cells promotes (p<0.05) the beta-glucosidase activity of cells for the benefit of enhanced (p<0.05) isoflavone glucosides bioconversion to bioactive aglycones in soymilk.

TI  == adherent properties and macrophage activation ability of 3 strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) must possess probiotic properties in order to be beneficial to humans and animals. the adherent properties, the acid and bile tolerance as well as the macrophage activation ability of isolated lab strains were investigated in this study. the adhesion was analyzed following heat, acid,  trypsin, and sodium periodate treatments. production of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) by raw 264.7 macrophages was also measured after stimulation with heat-killed lab strains. the viable strains of lactobacillus fermentum af7, l. acidophilus gg5, and l. plantarum bb9 were able to tightly adhere to the intestinal caco-2 cells. in addition, the gg5 strain was not affected by heating, acid, trypsin, or sodium periodate treatment. however, the adhesion of strains af7 and bb9 was reduced significantly by heating and trypsin treatment. this result suggested the gg5 and af7 or bb9 strains had different cell-surface adherent factors. tnf-alpha production by the raw 264.7 macrophages was induced significantly following stimulation with heat-killed lab  at 10(8) cfu/ml in a dose-dependent fashion. in addition, macrophage activity was similar whether the treatment consisted of live probiotics, or probiotics treated with heat, acid, or trypsin. however, the activity was reduced after treating with sonication. these in vitro results showed that the lab studied possess probiotic characteristics, such as acid or bile tolerance, adherent capability, and immune activation, and may suggest that these lab strains retain their probiotic activity as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == isoflavone phytoestrogens in soymilk fermented with beta-glucosidase producing probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == isoflavones significantly contribute to human health and disease prevention, and  exist as glucosides and aglycones. the beta-glucosidase enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosides to aglycones is very sensitive to molecular structure, and thus the profile of the isoflavones can affect their rate of hydrolysis. soymilk was fermented with lactobacillus acidophilus b4496 (la), lactobacillus bulgaricus cfr2028 (lb), lactobacillus casei b1922 (lc), lactobacillus plantarum b4495 (lp)  and lactobacillus fermentum b4655 (lf) for 48 h at 37 degrees c. beta-glucosidase activity was determined using p-nitrophenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside as a substrate and the hydrolysis was carried out in soymilk. during fermentation, maximum growth was seen at 24 h with lb, lc, lp and lf and at 48 h with la. polyphenol content ranged from 12.98 to 17.90 at 24 h and from 12.44 to 15.24 mg/100 ml at 48 h of fermentation. all the lactic acid bacteria produced beta-glucosidase enzyme, which hydrolyzed isoflavone glucosides to aglycones at a significant level (p < 0.05) in the fermented soymilk.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == phytase activity from lactobacillus spp. in calcium-fortified soymilk.
AB  == the presence of phytate in calcium-fortified soymilk may interfere with mineral absorption. certain lactic acid bacteria (lab) produce the enzyme phytase that degrades phytates and therefore may potentially improve mineral bioavailability and absorption. this study investigates the phytase activity and phytate degradation potential of 7 strains of lab including: lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4962, atcc33200, atcc4356, atcc4161, l. casei ascc290, l. plantarum ascc276,  and l. fermentum vri-003. activity of these bacteria was examined both in screening media and in calcium-fortified soymilk supplemented with potassium phytate. most strains produced phytase under both conditions with l. acidophilus  atcc4161 showing the highest activity. phytase activity in fortified soymilk fermented with l. acidophilus atcc4962 and l. acidophilus atcc4161 increased by 85% and 91%, respectively, between 12 h and 24 h of fermentation. all strains expressed peak phytase activity at approximately ph 5. however, no phytate degradation could be observed.

TI  == bacteriocins produced by l. fermentum and l. acidophilus can inhibit cephalosporin resistant e. coli.
AB  == reemerging infections occur due to resistant bacteria. such infections create restrictions for clinicians and microbiologists in drug selection. such problems  demand new strategies for solution. use of bacteriocins for this purpose may be fruitful. in the present research work, the inhibitory effects of bactericins on  cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli are used as model system for the control of antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria. cephalosporin resistant escherichia  coli strain was isolated from pus by using conventional methodology. for bacteriocin production, lactobacilli strains were selected by using selective media. out of seventy two strains isolated from yogurt, fecal materials of human, chick, parrot and cat, only two strains (strain 45 and strain 52) were found to produce bacteriocins having antimicrobial potential against cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli. biochemical characterization showed that strain 45 belonged to group of lactobacillus fermentum and strain 52 to lactobacillus acidophilus. both strains showed maximum growth at 25 degrees c and 35 degrees c  respectively. suitable ph was 5.5 and 6.0 for lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus respectively. bacteriocins produced by both strains were found stable at 50, 75 and 100 degrees c for 60min. function of bacteriocin  was also not disturbed due to change in ph. these findings suggest that bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus can be used for the infection control of cephalosporin resistant escherichia coli.

TI  == intestinal lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  == the higher counts or particular groups (firmicutes/bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. we further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. the questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of  blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (bdc-ldl) of blood sera were explored. the pcr-based intestinal lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (lab) were tested. the facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. the number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). in elderly consuming probiotics the lab counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (or=1.71, ci95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (bmi). the colonization by l. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to l. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and bmi (or=0.16, ci95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). however, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for bmi (adj. r(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. the higher white blood cells (wbc) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and bmi (adj. r(2)=0.193, p=0.027). the lower values of ox-ldl were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and bmi (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; adj. r(2)=0.184 p=0.029). in conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with wbc count, blood glucose and content of ox-ldl which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (cvd).

TI  == modeling bacterial contamination of fuel ethanol fermentation.
AB  == the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria may limit the effectiveness of antibiotics to treat bacterial contamination in fuel ethanol plants, and therefore, new antibacterial intervention methods and tools to test their application are needed. using shake-flask cultures of saccharomyces cerevisiae grown on saccharified corn mash and strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a dry-grind ethanol facility, a simple model to simulate bacterial contamination  and infection was developed. challenging the model with 10(8) cfu/ml lactobacillus fermentum decreased ethanol yield by 27% and increased residual glucose from 6.2 to 45.5 g/l. the magnitude of the effect was proportional to the initial bacterial load, with 10(5) cfu/ml l. fermentum still producing an 8% decrease in ethanol and a 3.2-fold increase in residual glucose. infection was also dependent on the bacterial species used to challenge the fermentation, as neither l. delbrueckii atcc 4797 nor l. amylovorus 0315-7b produced a significant decrease in ethanol when inoculated at a density of 10(8) cfu/ml. in the shake-flask model, treatment with 2 microg/ml virginiamycin mitigated the infection when challenged with a susceptible strain of l. fermentum (mic for virginiamycin < or =2 ppm), but treatment was ineffective at treating infection by a resistant strain of l. fermentum (mic = 16 ppm). the model may find application in developing new antibacterial agents and management practices for use in controlling contamination in the fuel ethanol industry.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria from vacuum packaged beef for antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (lab) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. lab mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five atcc reference lactobacillus strains. thirty six isolates showed activity in the  agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. however, only six cell free supernatants (cfs) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. l. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas l. plantarum and l. fermentum were the most resistant ones. identification by midi system indicated that these lab isolates were lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus casei gc subgroup a. the antagonistic factors produced by most of these lab against l. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees c for 10 min) and stable over a wide ph  range (4.0 to 9.0). these data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.

TI  == bactericidal activity of culture fluid components of lactobacillus fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3, and their capacity to modulate adhesion of candida albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == antagonistic activities of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21), l. casei atcc 27216, and l. acidophilus atcc 4356 and bactericidal activity of lactobacillus culture fluid towards e. coli strain k12, s. aureus, and s. epidermidis test cultures were studied. the bactericidal effect of l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation (ph 6.0) on the test cultures was dose-dependent. adhesion of c. albicans yeast-like fungi to vaginal epitheliocytes was more pronounced for strains isolated from women with asymptomatic infection than for strains isolated from women with manifest forms. l. fermentum strain 90 ts-4 (21) clone 3 culture fluid preparation modulated adhesion of yeast-like fungi only if  the fungal strain was initially highly adherent.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole on growth and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objectives: proton pump inhibitors (ppi) used to suppress acid secretion in the stomach are among the most widely prescribed medications. there is emerging evidence of proton secretion elsewhere in the aerodigestive tract, and acidic microenvironments are integral to oral flora such as lactobacillus. the hypothesis of this study is that the growth rate and morphology of oral lactobacillus strains are effected by ppis. methods: nineteen different strains of lactobacilli were inoculated in microtiter plates at ph of 4.5 to 6.5 and exposed to twofold dilutions of pantoprazole at a range of 2.5 mg/ml to 2.5 microg/ml. bacterial growth was monitored, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the drug was determined for the strains most sensitive to  pantoprazole. results: in the unexposed (control) group, nine lactobacilli strains were affected by ph changes from 6.5 to 4.5. in the group exposed to pantoprazole, 9 of the 19 lactobacilli strains were found to have an mic below 625 microg/ml, with l. plantarum 14917 being the most sensitive (mic = 20 microg/ml). in some strains, such as l. s. salivarius 11741, gram-staining revealed conformational changes in the bacteria when grown in the presence of pantoprazole. conclusion: growth rates and morphology of oral lactobacillus are affected by the ph of the environment. pantoprazole at supraphysiologic doses further affects growth rates and conformation in some strains. significance: the  balance of oral flora and upper digestive tract homeostasis may be affected by unexpected targets of ppi pharmacotherapy, with possible unanticipated consequences.

TI  == fermentation of calcium-fortified soymilk with lactobacillus: effects on calcium  solubility, isoflavone conversion, and production of organic acids.
AB  == the objective of this study was to enhance calcium solubility and bioavailability from calcium-fortified soymilk by fermentation with 7 strains of lactobacillus, namely, l. acidophilus atcc 4962, atcc33200, atcc 4356, atcc 4461, l. casei ascc  290, l. plantarum ascc 276, and l. fermentum vri-003. the parameters that were used are viability, ph, calcium solubility, organic acid, and biologically active isoflavone aglycone content. calcium-fortified soymilk made from soy protein isolate was inoculated with these probiotic strains, incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c, then stored for 14 d at 4 degrees c. soluble calcium was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (aa). organic acids and bioactive isoflavone aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein, were measured using hplc. viability of the strains in the fermented calcium-fortified soymilk was > 8.5 log(10) cfu/g after 24 h fermentation and this was maintained for 14-d  storage at 4 degrees c. after 24 h, there was a significant increase (p < 0.05) in soluble calcium. l. acidophilus atcc 4962 and l. casei ascc 290 demonstrated the highest increase with 89.3% and 87.0% soluble calcium after 24 h, respectively. the increase in calcium solubility observed was related to lowered  ph associated with production of lactic and acetic acids. fermentation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the level of conversion of isoflavones into biologically active aglycones, including diadzein, genistein, and glycetein. our  results show that fermenting calcium-fortified soymilk with the selected probiotics can potentially enhance the calcium bioavailability of calcium-fortified soymilk due to increased calcium solubility and bioactive isoflavone aglycone enrichment.

TI  == probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with  the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == alteration of the canine small-intestinal lactic acid bacterium microbiota by feeding of potential probiotics.
AB  == five potentially probiotic canine fecal lactic acid bacterium (lab) strains, lactobacillus fermentum lab8, lactobacillus salivarius lab9, weissella confusa lab10, lactobacillus rhamnosus lab11, and lactobacillus mucosae lab12, were fed to five permanently fistulated beagles for 7 days. the survival of the strains and their potential effects on the indigenous intestinal lab microbiota were monitored for 17 days. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) demonstrated that the five fed lab strains survived in the upper gastrointestinal tract and modified the dominant preexisting indigenous jejunal lab microbiota of  the dogs. when the lab supplementation was ceased, dgge analysis of jejunal chyme showed that all the fed lab strains were undetectable after 7 days. however, the  diversity of the intestinal indigenous microbiota of the dogs, as characterized from jejunal chyme plated on lactobacillus selective medium without acetic acid,  was reduced and did not return to the original level during the study period. in  all but one dog, an indigenous lactobacillus acidophilus strain emerged as the dominant lab strain. in conclusion, strains lab8 to lab12 have potential as probiotic strains for dogs as they survive in and dominate the jejunal lab microbiota during feeding and have the ability to modify the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == importance of the host specificity in the selection of probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract is a complex and dynamic ecosystem. commensal microorganisms (c), which proliferate in the intestine from birth, are crucial for gut homeostasis while non commensal (nc) microorganisms are transient and enter the organism from the environment and foods. we studied comparatively the influence of oral administration of c and nc lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacilus acidophilus on the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (galt) of conventional mice. to determine the importance of the selection of probiotic host-specificity bacteria with immunomodulating capacity, we examined the interaction with the gut by transmission electron microscopy and fitc-labelled bacteria. we compared the immunomodulation capacities of c and nc strains by studying the number of iga secreting cells and cytokine profile. no differences were found in the number of iga+ cells; however, the pattern of cytokine response to c and nc bacteria was different. with regard to proinflammatory cytokine (ifngamma and tnfalpha), we found that tnfalpha was mainly produced by nc bacteria, while c bacteria were able to elicit mainly ifngamma. the regulatory cytokines (il-10 and il-4) were induced with different patterns for both c and nc strains. no differences in the pathway of internalization to the gut between c and nc were found. in summary, we determined that c and nc bacteria interact with the intestine in the same way; both c and nc bacteria were able to reinforce the  surveillance of the gut mucosal immune system. the cytokine profile showed that c bacteria would be involved in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis rather than in the immune activation as the nc bacteria.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review.
AB  == vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) is a common infection affecting the quality of life of many women. probiotics have been investigated as possible agents for the  prevention of recurrences of vvc. we reviewed the available literature. in some studies the development of vvc was associated with either a low number of lactobacilli in the vagina or with the presence of h2o2-non-producing vaginal lactobacilli, although there are a few studies not supporting these statements. in addition, in vitro studies have shown that lactobacilli can inhibit the growth of candida albicans and/or its adherence on the vaginal epithelium. the results of some clinical trials support the effectiveness of lactobacilli, especially lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, administered either orally or intravaginally in colonizing the vagina and/or preventing the colonization and infection of the vagina by c. albicans, while the results of a small number of clinical trials do not corroborate these findings. nevertheless, most of the relevant clinical trials had methodological problems such as small sample size, no control group (placebo) and included women without confirmed recurrent vvc, and thus they are not reliable for drawing definitive conclusions. thus, the available evidence for the use of probiotics for prevention of recurrent vvc is limited. however, the empirical use of probiotics may be considered in women with frequent recurrence of vvc (more than three episodes per year), especially for those who have adverse effects from or contraindications for the use of antifungal agents, since adverse effects of probiotics are very rare. in any case women should be clearly informed about the unproven usefulness of probiotics for this purpose. in conclusion, despite the promising results of some studies, further research is needed to prove the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing the recurrences of vvc and to allow their wide use for this indication.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus isolates on the adhesion of pathogens to chicken intestinal mucus in vitro.
AB  == aims: the aims of this study were to investigate in vitro the effects of lactobacillus isolates from a chicken on adhesion of pathogenic salmonella and escherichia coli to chicken intestinal mucus obtained from different intestinal regions. methods and results: bacteria were labelled by using methyl-1,2-[(3)h]-thymidine. the bacterial adhesion was assessed by measuring the radioactivity of bacteria adhered to the mucus. the results showed that the abilities of lactobacillus spp. to bind to the same intestinal mucus were higher  than those of pathogenic salmonella and e. coli. pretreatment of intestinal mucus with lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus acidophilus, alone or in combination, reduced the adhesion of the tested pathogens, but the reductive extent of pathogenic adhesion by lactobacillus spp. in combination was relatively high. conclusions: the tested bacteria had different adhesions to mucus glycoproteins isolated from different intestinal regions of chicken. lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum in combination revealed a better ability to inhibit attachments of salmonella and e. coli to chicken intestinal mucus than lactobacillus sp. alone. significance and impact of the study: a mixture of intestinal lactobacillus spp. from a chicken may play a protective role in excluding pathogenic salmonella and e. coli from the intestine of chicken.

AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == genetic diversity, dynamics, and activity of lactobacillus community involved in  traditional processing of artisanal manchego cheese.
AB  == a total of 248 strains of predominant lactobacilli isolated during the manufacture and ripening of artisanal manchego cheeses obtained from two dairies  were obtained and the genetic diversity of 197 investigated using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd-pcr). 51 isolates could not be lysed and were therefore not genotyped. forty-two distinct rapd patterns, grouped in six major clusters at a similarity level of 54%, were obtained. phenotypic characterization of isolates enabled their assignment to the species l. plantarum, l. brevis, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. pentosus, l. acidophilus and l. curvatus. in samples from both dairies, the species l. plantarum, l. brevis and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei dominated during ripening. three genotypes showed excellent physiological characteristics and were therefore proposed as adjunct cultures for manchego cheese manufacture.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  == background: lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) producers. nonoxynol-9 (n-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. it immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. it is known that n-9 inhibits lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. purpose: the present study was conducted to identify the species of lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the h(2)o(2)-producing and n-9-resistant strains in an argentine population. results: we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, l. casei subsp. casei, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. in this argentine, south american population, 62% of women had h(2)o(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. we found a high number of sensitive  strains. sixty-two h(2)o(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to n-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of n-9. discussion: the vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among argentine women as in other countries,  and (2) n-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

TI  == [inhibitory activity of vaginal lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

TI  == plasmid profiling and curing of lactobacillus strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of chicken.
AB  == in this study, we assessed the susceptibility of 12 lactobacillus strains, all of which had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of chicken, to three antibiotics (chloramphenicol, erythromycin and tetracycline) used commonly as selective markers in transformation studies of lactic acid bacteria. among these  strains, 17%, 58%, and 25% were found to exhibit a high degree of resistance to 200 microg/ml of tetracycline, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol, respectively. seven of the 12 lactobacillus strains exhibiting resistance to at least 50 microg/ml of chloramphenicol or erythromycin, and five strains exhibiting resistance to at least 50 microg/ml of tetracycline, were subsequently subjected  to plasmid curing with chemical curing agents, such as novobiocin, acriflavin, sds, and ethidium bromide. in no cases did the antibiotic resistance of these strains prove to be curable, with the exception of the erythromycin resistance exhibited by five lactobacillus strains (l. acidophilus i16 and i26, l. fermentum i24 and c17, and l. brevis c10). analysis of the plasmid profiles of these five cured derivatives revealed that all of the derivatives, except for l. acidophilus i16, possessed profiles similar to those of wild-type strains. the curing of l. acidophilus i16 was accompanied by the loss of 4.4 kb, 6.1 kb, and 11.5 kb plasmids.

TI  == enhanced clearance of candida albicans from the oral cavities of mice following oral administration of lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == orally administered live lactobacillus acidophilus was assessed for its capacity  to enhance clearance from the oral cavity of dba/2 mice shown previously to be 'infection prone'. l. acidophilus fed to dba/2 mice significantly shortened the duration of colonization of the oral cavity compared to controls. enhanced clearance of candida albicans correlated with both early mrna gene expression for interleukin (il)-4 and interferon (ifn)-gamma and expression of their secreted products in cultures of cervical lymph nodes stimulated with candida antigen. in  addition rapid clearance correlated with higher levels of ifn-gamma and nitric oxide in saliva. delayed clearance, less pronounced levels of the cytokine response, saliva ifn-gamma and nitric oxide, and later mrna expression for il-4 and ifn-gamma relative to feeding with the l. acidophilus isolate were noted in mice fed a different lactobacillus isolate (l. fermentum). these observations indicate significant variations in individual isolates to activate the common mucosal system.

TI  == detection of leuconostoc strains at a meat processing plant using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == to simplify the labor-intensive conventional routine testing of samples to detect leuconostoc at a meat processing plant, we developed polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers specific for leuconostoc from 16s rrna gene sequences. these primers did not detect other common lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus plantarum, lact. sake, lact. fermentum, lact. acidophilus and weissella viridescens. pcr with this primer detected all leuconostoc species tested (leu. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, leu. pseudomesenteroides, leu. carnosum, leu. lactic, leu. citreum, leu. amelibiosum, leu. gelidum), except for leu. fallax, and no other lactic acid bacteria on agarose gel electrophoresis. the method could identify areas contaminated with leuconostoc in a large-scale industrial meat processing plant. of 69 samples analyzed, 34 were positive for leuconostoc according to the conventional culture method (isolation of lab producing dextran) and pcr, whereas 29 were negative according to both. six samples were culture-negative but positive by pcr. no false negative results were generated by pcr. the method is rapid and simple, is useful for routinely monitoring areas contaminated with leuconostoc in meat processing plants, and could help to prevent the spoilage of meat products.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus fermentum kc5b and its use for constructing a stable lactobacillus cloning vector.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum kc5b, a strain originally isolated from the human vagina, contains a cryptic plasmid pkc5b. the sequence and genetic organization of the 4392-bp plasmid were determined. it contains two convergently oriented replicons, which are homologous to each other and to the stable replicon of the enterococcus faecium plasmid pmbb1. the two replicons of pkc5b were used either individually or together to construct lactobacillus-escherichia coli shuttle plasmids. only the plasmid psp1 that carried both replicons transformed lactobacilli, suggesting a complementary function between the two replicons. since the replicons had a high homology to those of other plasmids that replicate via a theta-like mechanism and no detectable single-stranded intermediates were found for the plasmid, it is possible that pkc5b may replicate via a theta-like mechanism. the  new shuttle plasmid psp1 has been transformed and stably maintained in several lactobacillus strains. as an initial application, psp1 was used to clone the s-layer protein gene (slpa) of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 into a heterologous vaginal lactobacillus strain and achieved surface-bound expression of the protein.

TI  == growth studies of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in cereal-based substrates.
AB  == aims: the overall growth kinetics of four potentially probiotic strains (lactobacillus fermentum, lact. reuteri, lact. acidophilus and lact. plantarum) cultured in malt, barley and wheat media were investigated. the objectives were to identify the main factors influencing the growth and metabolic activity of each strain in association with the cereal substrate. methods and results: all fermentations were performed without ph control. a logistic-type equation, which  included a growth inhibition term, was used to describe the experimental data. in the malt medium, all strains attained high maximum cell populations (8.10-10.11 log10 cfu ml(-1), depending on the strain), probably due to the availability of maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose (approx. 15 g l(-1) total fermentable sugars) and free amino nitrogen (approx. 80 mg l(-1)). the consumption of sugars during the exponential phase (10-12 h) resulted in the accumulation of lactic acid (1.06-1.99 g l(-1)) and acetic acid (0.29-0.59 g l(-1)), which progressively decreased the ph of the medium. each strain demonstrated a specific preference for one or more sugars. since small amounts of sugars were consumed by the end of the exponential phase (17-43%), the decisive growth-limiting factor was probably  the ph, which at that time ranged between 3.40 and 3.77 for all of the strains. analysis of the metabolic products confirmed the heterofermentative or homofermentative nature of the strains used, except in the case of lact. acidophilus which demonstrated a shift towards the heterofermentative pathway. all strains produced acetic acid during the exponential phase, which could be attributed to the presence of oxygen. lactobacillus plantarum, lact. reuteri and  lact. fermentum continued to consume the remaining sugars and accumulate metabolic products in the medium, probably due to energy requirements for cell viability, while lact. acidophilus entered directly into the decline phase. in the barley and wheat media all strains, especially lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri, attained lower maximum cell populations (7.20-9.43 log10 cfu ml(-1)) than in the malt medium. this could be attributed to the low sugar content (3-4 g l(-1) total fermentable sugar for each medium) and the low free amino nitrogen concentration (15.3-26.6 mg l(-1)). in all fermentations, the microbial growth ceased at ph values (3.73-4.88, depending on the strain) lower than those observed for malt fermentations, which suggests that substrate deficiency in sugars and free amino nitrogen contributed to growth limitation. conclusions: the malt medium supported the growth of all strains more than barley and wheat media  due to its chemical composition, while lact. plantarum and lact. fermentum appeared to be less fastidious and more resistant to acidic conditions than lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri. significance and impact of the study: cereals are  suitable substrates for the growth of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

TI  == characterisation and differentiation of lactobacilli by lectin typing.
AB  == lactobacillus isolates from healthy estonian and swedish children were characterised by a lectin typing technique; 56 isolates from six species (l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. buchneri) were tested. the typing system was based on an agglutination assay with a panel of six commercially available lectins, which were chosen on the basis of their carbohydrate specificities. the isolates were also subjected to proteolytic degradation before lectin typing to decrease auto-agglutination of whole cells in the assay. the 56 isolates were divided into 15 different lectin types by their lectin agglutination patterns. proteolytic treatment reduced auto-agglutination for the majority of species, apart from l. acidophilus, which remained predominantly auto-agglutinating (eight of nine strains). the system produced stable and reproducible results under standardised culture conditions. lactobacilli are important bacteria for use as probiotics and this system may supplement current molecular typing techniques and may help in identification of  strains that could be useful in this role.

AB  == effect of different antibiotics and standard antibacterial therapy regimes on intestine microflora was investigated. lincozamides demonstrated the most negative effect. early addition of probiotics to the treatment with antibacterials had positive effect. susceptibility of 21 strains of normal microflora to 25 antibiotics was tested. resistance to antibiotics of lactobacilli varied significantly (more among strains and less among species). it was shown that l. acidophilus (probiotic "acilact") was resistant to metronidazole only. high resistance to antibiotics was shown for l. plantarum 8ra3, l. fermentum 90t4c (components of probiotic "lactobacterin"), l. fermentum  bl96, l. acidophilus bl and l. acidophilus (component of "linex"). susceptibility of microorganisms in complex formulation "linex" to the modern antibiotics was low. it is concluded that the use of stable antibiotic-resistant strains of normal microflora is favorable as addition to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular identification and clustering of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from wheat (species triticum durum and triticum aestivum) sourdoughs of southern italy.
AB  == the microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the apulia region, southern italy, was characterized. the sourdoughs were mainly produced from triticum durum wheat. the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. about 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16s rdna and 16s/23s rrna spacer region pcr. overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as lb. alimentarius, 14% as lb. brevis, 12% as leuconostoc citreum, 7% as lb. plantarum, 6% as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as lb. fermentum and lb. acidophilus,  2% as weissella confusa and 1% as lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. the phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. a microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread.

TI  == reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the us. ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of e. coli o157:h7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. we studied the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium and a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by sheep experimentally infected with  the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. following oral inoculation with 10(10)cfu of e. coli o157:h7, 30 suffolk ram lambs were blocked  by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. the lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with l. acidophilus or with s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum. the microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)cfu per kilogram of diet. fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol macconkey agar (ct-smac) as a selective media. e. coli o157:h7 was confirmed by its reaction with o157 and h7 antisera. e. coli o157:h7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. however, lambs administered a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and  l. plantarum shed significantly lower (p=0.0211) average number of e. coli o157:h7 (2.3log(10)cfu per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. s. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (p=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of l. acidophulus and s. faecium in  fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)cfu per gram of feces) but significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)cfu per gram of  feces) and those supplemented with l. acidophilus (5.5log(10)cfu per gram of feces). average daily gain (adg) and gain to feed ratio (g:f) were significantly  improved (p=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for l. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for s. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for l. acidophulus and s. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum supplemented lambs. the study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with e. coli o157:h7 with s. faecium or a mixture of s. faecium, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of e. coli o157:h7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.

TI  == analysis of promoter sequences from lactobacillus and lactococcus and their activity in several lactobacillus species.
AB  == promoter-active fragments were isolated from the genome of the probiotic organism lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg using the promoter-probe vector pnz272. these promoter elements, together with a promoter fragment isolated from the vaginal strain lactobacillus fermentum br11 and two previously defined promoters (lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 slpa), were introduced into three strains of lactobacillus. primer-extension analysis was used to map the transcriptional start site for each promoter. all promoter fragments tested were functional in each of the three lactobacilli and a purine residue was used to initiate transcription in most cases. the promoter elements encompassed a 52- to 1,140-fold range in promoter activity depending on the host  strain. lactobacillus promoters were further examined by surveying previously mapped sequences for conserved base positions. the lactobacillus hexamer regions  (-35: ttgaca and -10: tataat) closely resembled those of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, with the highest degree of agreement at the -10 hexamer. the tg dinucleotide upstream of the -10 hexamer was conserved in 26% of lactobacillus promoters studied, but conservation rates differed between species. the region upstream of the -35 hexamer of lactobacillus promoters showed conservation with the bacterial up element.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == [cloning and gene expression in lactic acid bacteria].
AB  == the possibility of using the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus as vector representatives is widely discussed at present. the prospects of the construction of recombinant bacteria are closely connected with the solution of a number of problems: the level of the transcription of cloned genes, the effectiveness of the translation of heterologous mrna, the stability of protein with respect to bacterial intracellular proteases, the method by protein molecules leave the cell (by secretion or as the result of lysis). to prevent segregation instability, the construction of vector molecules on the basis of stable cryptic plasmids found in wild strains of lactic acid bacteria was proposed. high copying plasmids with low molecular weight were detected in l. plantarum and l. pentosus strains. several plasmids with molecular weights of 1.7, 1.8 and 2.3 kb were isolated from bacterial cells to be used as the basis for the construction of vector molecules. genes of chloramphenicol- and erythromycin-resistance from staphylococcus aureus  plasmids were used as marker genes ensuring cell transformation. the vector plasmids thus constructed exhibited high transformation activity in the electroporation of different strains, including l. casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis which could be classified with the replicons of a wide circle of hosts. but the use of these plasmids was limited due to the risk of the uncontrolled dissemination of recombinant plasmids. l. acidophilus were also found to have strictly specific plasmids with good prospects of being used as the basis for the creation of vectors, incapable of dissemination. in addition to the search of strain-specific plasmids, incapable of uncontrolled gene transmission, the use of chromosome-integrated heterologous  genes is recommended in cloning to ensure the maximum safety.

TI  == lactobacillus flora in the cloaca and vagina of hens and its inhibitory activity  against salmonella enteritidis in vitro.
AB  == lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of 40 normal laying hens were investigated  quantitatively and qualitatively, and their ability to inhibit growth of salmonella enteritidis (se) was examined using a spot-the-lawn technique. all samples of cloacal contents and half the samples of vaginal mucus were positive for lactobacilli. the means +/- sd of total lactobacillus counts in the cloaca and those in the vagina were log10 5.5 +/- 1.1 and 2.5 +/- 2.6 cfu/g, respectively. in the cloaca, lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from 92.5% of hens, and lactobacillus salivarius was isolated from 85.0% of hens, whereas lactobacillus fermentum was isolated from only one hen. in the vagina, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius were isolated from 42.5% of hens. in the inhibition assay in vitro, all strains of lactobacillus from cloacal contents and vaginal mucus inhibited growth of se. there was a wide range of the inhibitory activity even in the same species. no difference of the growth inhibition zone was observed between lactobacilli from cloaca and those from vagina. the present study suggested that lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of hens might have a protective effect against se colonization.

AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == efficiency of transcription from promoter sequence variants in lactobacillus is both strain and context dependent.
AB  == the introduction of consensus -35 (ttgaca) and -10 (tataat) hexamers and a tg motif into the lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 wild-type slpa promoter resulted in significant improvements (4.3-, 4.1-, and 10.7-fold, respectively) in transcriptional activity in lactobacillus fermentum br11. in contrast, the same changes resulted in decreased transcription in lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. the tg motif was shown to be important in the context of weak -35 and -10 hexamers (l. fermentum br11) or a consensus -10 hexamer (l. rhamnosus gg). thus, both strain-  and context-dependent effects are critical factors influencing transcription in lactobacillus.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

AB  == representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final ph recorded. most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum. streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. plaque ph was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or lactulose bp. these studies in vivo showed both lactulose and lactulose bp to exhibit low acidogenic potential. thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of short bowel syndrome-associated d-lactic  acidemia.
AB  == previously, we have demonstrated that short bowel syndrome (sbs) patients suffer  daily from d-lactic acidemia; in these patients rather high amounts of (bacterial) d-lactate emerge in blood and urine with a circadian rhythm. the aim  of this study was to establish the microbial basis of d-lactic acidemia in sbs. therefore, faecal flora of (young and adult) sbs-patients was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively, and compared to that of controls. the isolated  bacterial species were screened for massive d- and/or l-lactate production after  in vitro growth. after introduction of oral feeding in sbs-infants shortly after  the resection, lactobacilli increased from < or = 1% up to 60 +/- 5% of the faecal flora within 2-3 weeks. in the faeces of patients with oral feeding the lactate producers lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus fermentum were the  major resident bacteria (each with 10(10)-10(12) cfu/g faeces). during active growth in vitro these lactobacilli produced massive amounts of d- and l-lactic acid from glucose. use of oral antibiotics in two sbs-children did not reduce the total numbers of lactobacilli, but caused shifts within the intestinal populations of at least lactobacilli. it is concluded that the strongly reduced intestinal capacity for carbohydrate absorption and the oral consumption of easily fermentable carbohydrates form the physiological basis for d-lactic acidemia in sbs, and that the fermentative d-lactate production by intestinal bacteria, especially the abundant, resident lactobacilli, forms its microbial basis. in these patients the antimicrobial and therapeutic effects of antibiotics are unpredictable.

TI  == adhesion of lactobacillus species in urine and phosphate buffer to silicone rubber and glass under flow.
AB  == coating uroepithelial cells or catheter materials with lactobacilli has been shown to retard the development of a uropathogenic biofilm, with biosurfactant production and strong adhesion being two prerequisite properties of the lactobacillus strains to be employed. in this paper, adhesion of six selected lactobacillus strains to silicone rubber and glass in urine and in a phosphate buffer was studied using a parallel plate flow chamber. in addition, adhesive cell surface properties of the lactobacilli, i.e. the ph dependences of their zeta potentials and their hydrophobicities by water contact angles, were determined. l. acidophilus atcc 4356 and l. fermentum b54 were the only strains showing significant adhesion to both hydrophobic silicone rubber and hydrophilic  glass, possibly by virtue of their high cell surface hydrophobicities (water contact angles of 68 and 75 degrees, respectively) and small zeta potentials (-10.0 and -8.1 mv in buffer, respectively). both hydrophobic lactobacillus strains adhered less well in urine than in buffer. the remaining lactobacillus strains studied were hydrophilic, with water contact angles between 25 and 36 degrees, and had highly negative zeta potentials, reaching -37.7 mv in buffer. adhesion of these highly negatively charged, hydrophilic strains in buffer was essentially absent, while for some of these strains minor adhesion in urine was observed. this study demonstrates that the adhesion of lactobacilli to substrata  differs with strain hydrophobicity and charge, and that urinary components can affect the ability of hydrophilic lactobacillus strains to adhere to substrata.

AB  == lactacin f is a two-component class ii bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi 11088. the laf operon is composed of the bacteriocin structural genes, lafa and lafx, and a third open reading frame, orfz. two strategies were employed to study the function of orfz. this gene was disrupted in the chromosome of nck64, a lafa729 lafx orfz derivative of vpi 11088. a disruption cassette consisting of orfz interrupted with a cat gene was cloned into psa3 and introduced into nck64. manipulation of growth temperatures and antibiotic selection resulted in homologous recombination which disrupted the chromosomal copy of orfz with the cat gene. this orfz mutation resulted in loss of immunity to lactacin f but had little effect on production of lafx, which is not bactericidal without lafa. expression of orfz in this orfz- background rescued the immune phenotype. expression of orfz in a bacteriocin-sensitive derivative of vpi 11088 also reestablished immunity. these data indicate that orfz, renamed lafi, encodes the immunity factor for the lactacin f system. the sensitivity of various lactobacillus strains to lactacin f was further evaluated. lactacin f inhibited 11 strains including several members of the a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, and b2  l. acidophilus homology groups. expression of lafi in bacteriocin-sensitive strains l. acidophilus atcc 4356, l. acidophilus ncfm/n2, l. fermentum ncdo1750,  l. gasseri atcc 33323, and l. johnsonii atcc 33200 provided immunity to lactacin  f. furthermore, it was shown that lactacin f production by vpi 11088 could be used to select for l. fermentum ncdo1750 transformants containing the recombinant plasmid encoding lafi. the data demonstrate that lafi is functional in heterologous hosts, suggesting that it may be a suitable food-grade genetic marker for use in lactobacillus species.

TI  == effect of adherent lactobacillus spp. on in vitro adherence of salmonellae to the intestinal epithelial cells of chicken.
AB  == single strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum, isolated from chicken intestine, were used to study in vitro interactions with salmonella enteritidis, salm. pullorum or salm. typhimurium in an ileal epithelial cell (iec) radioactive assay. exclusion, competition and displacement phenomena were investigated by respectively incubating (a) lactobacilli and iec together, prior  to addition of salmonellae, (b) lactobacilli, iec and salmonellae together, and (c) salmonellae and iec, followed by the lactobacilli. lactobacilli were selected for study because of their strong ability to adhere to iec and poor aggregation with salmonellae. the results demonstrated that lact. acidophilus significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the attachment of salm. pullorum to iec in the tests for exclusion and competition, but not in the displacement tests. lactobacillus fermentum was found to have some ability to reduce the attachment of salm. typhimurium to iec under the conditions of exclusion (p < 0.08), competition (p < 0.09), but not displacement. however, both lact. acidophilus and lact. fermentum  were unable to reduce the adherence of salm. enteritidis to iec under any of the  conditions.

TI  == inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis by biosurfactants from lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == in this study, 15 lactobacillus isolates were found to produce biosurfactants in  the mid-exponential and stationary growth phases. the stationary-phase biosurfactants from lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469, lactobacillus fermentum b54, and lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 were investigated further to determine their capacity to inhibit the initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis 1131 to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rate of e. faecalis to glass with an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from l. acidophilus rc14 or l. fermentum b54 was significantly decreased by approximately 70%, while the number of adhering enterococci after 4 h of adhesion was reduced by an average of 77%. the surface activity of the biosurfactants and their activity inhibiting the initial adhesion of e. faecalis 1131 were retained after dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 6,000  to 8,000) and freeze-drying. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the freeze-dried biosurfactants from l.  acidophilus rc14 and l. fermentum b54 were richest in protein, while those from l. casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469 had relatively high polysaccharide and phosphate contents.

TI  == the potential of lactobacillus as a carrier for oral immunization: development and preliminary characterization of vector systems for targeted delivery of antigens.
AB  == oral administration of lactobacilli evokes mucosal and systemic immune responses  against epitopes associated with these organisms (gerritse et al., 1990, 1991). the adjuvant function of different lactobacillus species was investigated under the conditions of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or oral administration. after  i.p. injection of trinitrophenylated chicken gamma-globulin, high dth responses were observed with lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum, but low responses with lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. in different experimental model systems l. casei and l. plantarum consistently showed significant adjuvanticity. a series of expression and expression-secretion vectors containing the strong constitutive promoter of the l. casei l-ldh gene or the regulatable promoter of the lactobacillus amylovorus amy gene (pouwels and leer, 1995) was used for the intracellular, extracellular and surface-bound expression of an influenza virus antigenic determinant fused to escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase. intracellular expression of the fusion protein amounted to 1-2% of total soluble protein. lactobacilli synthesizing the  fusion protein intracellularly evoked an oral immune response after subcutaneous  priming.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == genetic analysis of acidocin b, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == the genes encoding the production of acidocin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus strain m46 which is active against listeria monocytogenes, clostridium sporogenes, brochothrix thermosphacta, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, but inactive against most other lactobacillus species, were previously localized on a 4 kb xbai-hindiii fragment of plasmid pcv461. in the present work, dna sequence analysis revealed the presence of three consecutive orfs, which potentially code  for hydrophobic peptides composed of 60, 91 and 114 amino acids, respectively, and a fourth orf of opposite polarity which could potentially encode a peptide of 59 amino acids. the middle orf (orf-2; acdb) was identified as the gene encoding  acidocin b by comparing the amino acid composition of highly purified acidocin b  with the deduced amino acid sequence of orf-2. our results suggest that acidocin  b is synthesized as a precursor which is processed at a site which conforms to the ' -3, -1' rules of von heijne to yield active acidocin b (59 amino acids). the presence of an immunity-protein-encoding gene on the 4 kb xbai-bamhi fragment was deduced from the capacity of a plasmid vector harbouring this fragment to confer immunity upon transformation of l. fermentum nck127. one of the three non-assigned orfs may encode this immunity protein.

AB  == quantitative differences in the content of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the content of the stomach, small and large intestine have been established when studying microflora of the gastrointestinal tract of minks kept in the 30-kilometer zone of the chernobyl npp (experimental animals) and at the cherkassy fur farm (control animals). obligate heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria related to lactobacillus fermentum and l. reuteri prevailed  in the stomach of experimental minks. species composition of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the stomach of the cherkassy minks is characterized by the availability of both obligate and facultative heterofermentative species of bacteria--l. bavaricus, l. coryniformis, l. reuteri and of obligate homofermentative bacteria--l. salivarius and l. jensenii. in limiting dilutions (10(-9)-10(-10)) of the content of small intestine of the control minks one could find bacteria of l. coryniformis species and representatives of obligate heterofermentative bacteria--l. confusus and l. fermentum that is 1-2 orders higher then in the experimental minks. both lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (the latter up to 10(+9) cells/g of the content) were isolated from the lower departments of small and large intestine of the chernobyl and cherkassy minks. among the species of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the experimental animals homofermentative species (l. acidophilus, l. sharpeae) and,  heterofermentative (l. confusus, l. fermentum) in the control were found.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. the strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on lactobacillus rhamnosus  and lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. other species were lact. acidophilus, lact. plantarum, lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-d-galactosidase and beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase followed by beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-fucosidase. the combined production of beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and alpha-d-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. in contrast, beta-d-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains  of lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. the most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting  cascade were activated protein c(ca)-like, activated factor x(xa)-like and hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == pathogenic potential of lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli are often considered to be commensal or beneficial participants in human microbial ecology and considerable research is being carried out into the effects of the use of lactobacilli as additives in both human and animal diets. however, lactobacilli also cause some human diseases (e.g. dental caries, rheumatic vascular disease, septicaemia and infective endocarditis (ie)), and have recently been identified as potential emerging pathogens in elderly and immunocompromised patients, particularly those receiving broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. the identification of potential pathogenic traits amongst lactobacilli will therefore facilitate the use of the organisms for probiotic purposes. the ability to aggregate human platelets is considered to be a possible pathogenic trait in the progression of ie. a comparison of bacterial cell surface properties amongst l. rhamnosus strains showed that platelets were aggregated by  5/5 ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. however two strains, morphological mutants of a non-aggregating strain, which had been re-isolated after passaging through rats were found to aggregate platelets. no loss of aggregating function occurred on extensive subculturing of ie strains. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains for five other species, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salvivarius, with each species being represented indicating that the property is not uncommon in the genus. a comparison of ie and oral isolates of l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and seven other lactobacillus species, has shown that the binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen by lactobacilli is greatly increased, up to 50 fold, when the ph is reduced from 7.0 to 5.0. re-exposing the lactobacilli to a neutral ph environment releases most of the bound proteins, but the amount still  remaining bound to the cell is several times more than is bound at neutral ph. lactobacilli will also bind to the proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. lactobacilli bound significantly better to collagen types i and v than to types iii and iv (p < 0.01). further, strains isolated from ie cases, particularly l. rhamnosus strains, bound significantly better to types i and v than did 'normal' strains (p < 0.02). type v collagen has been demonstrated at the sites of endothelial damage. thus the binding of lactobacilli, particularly l. rhamnosus to these collagen types may be of importance in the early stages of colonization of the damaged heart valve.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus spp. on the attachment of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to isolated porcine enterocytes.
AB  == a total of 43 strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of piglets at the time of weaning. isolates, grown on solid media, were allocated to strongly adherent or non/weakly adherent groups on the basis of numbers attaching to isolated porcine enterocytes. strains of lactobacillus fermentum were disproportionally represented amongst the strongly-adherent strains and lact. acidophilus and lact. salivarius amongst the non/weakly-adherent group. lactobacilli showed significantly better attachment ability when grown on agar than when grown in broth culture. strongly adherent strains were not found to effect the attachment of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli to porcine enterocytes, tested under the conditions of exclusion (lactobacilli added to the enterocytes before e. coli), competition (lactobacilli and e. coli added simultaneously) and displacement (e. coli added before lactobacilli). tests were made with [14c]-labelled e. coli. suspensions of bacteria and enterocytes were passed through a filter selected to retain enterocytes but pass free bacterial cells. counts (dpm) obtained from filters after solubilization were taken as a measure of e. coli attachment. some strains  of lactobacilli coaggregated with enterotoxigenic e. coli with k88 fimbriae, but  not with a k88-negative mutants strain. these were excluded from the competitive  exclusion experiments. in the apparent absence of a direct effect on the association of e. coli with host tissue, removal of potential gut pathogens by aggregation could contribute to the probiotic properties ascribed to lactic acid  bacteria.

AB  == rampant dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats fed a high sucrose diet without infection of mutans streptococci, in which increased numbers of lactobacilli and s. aureus were demonstrated in the oral flora. administration of either penicillin or piperacillin, effective against all isolates of lactobacilli, markedly inhibited the caries induction in these rats, while severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats given vancomycin that is inhibitory against s. aureus. these results suggested that certain lactobacilli might induce dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet. three strains of lactobacillus species isolated from the hyposalivated rats were made resistant to erythromycin. the caries-inducing activity of these erythromycin-resistant lactobacilli was studied in hyposalivated rats giving erythromycin in the drinking water at a concentration of 500 micrograms/ml. after a 61-day experimental period, severe dental caries was induced in hyposalivated rats infected with l. fermentum ty1r. on the other hand, low caries incidence was found in hyposalivated rats infected with either l. acidophilus ty7r or l. plantarum ty3r. these results indicate that l. fermentum may be one of causative  agents of dental caries in hyposalivated rats fed a sucrose diet.

AB  == the effects of selected nrrl strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus and l. fermentum upon oligosaccharide, phytate and alkaloid contents, as well as on the nutritive value of lupine, were investigated. lupine  was processed to a 12% total solids suspension, inoculated with 1% (v/v) cultures and fermented until a final desired ph of 4.5. l. acidophilus b-2092 and l. buchneri b-1837 growth was related to a significant sucrose breakdown and decreases of phytates, whereas l. acidophilus b-1910 and l. fermentum b-585 reduced the content of flatulence oligosaccharides. the activity of l. acidophilus b-1910 was particularly associated with lowering of alkaloids and increase of riboflavin. lactic acid fermentation produced slight changes in lysine and methionine contents. no significant differences in net protein ratio values and protein digestibility were found between fermented and unfermented lupine (p less than 0.05). a 1:1 ratio mixture of b-1910 and b-2092 strains of l. acidophilus lead to a final fermented lupine with nutritional advantages to those given by the individual cultures.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of a range of lactobacillus species to chlorhexidine, minocycline, and spiramycin, at a range of ph from 5.0 to 7.4. strains of streptococcus were also tested for their sensitivity to chlorhexidine, as a comparison between the genera. there were both inter- and intra-species variations in the sensitivity of these strains to chlorhexidine. the strains tested were sensitive at ph 6.7 to the following levels of chlorhexidine (micrograms/ml): l. casei (6 strains), 10-60; l. plantarum (4 strains), 40; l. fermentum (13 strains), 2-20; l. brevis (1 strain), 10; and l. acidophilus (3 strains), 10-60. the streptococcus species were sensitive to 1-4 micrograms/ml (13 strains); 4-10 micrograms/ml (3 strains); and  10-20 micrograms/ml (2 strains). one strain was able to survive 20 micrograms/ml. chlorhexidine was found to be less effective at lower ph levels. the following examples show sensitivity (micrograms/ml) at ph 6.5 followed by sensitivity at ph 5.0: l. casei (atcc 15008), 40,60; l. plantarum (ch 374), 40,100; l. fermentum (ch 324) 10,40; l. acidophilus (atcc 4356), 10,40; and s. mutans (bm 52), 2,2. all of the strains of lactobacillus tested with spiramycin were resistant at ph 5.0. minocycline was less affected by changes in ph, but at ph 7.4 lactobacillus  strains were more resistant to minocycline as compared with spiramycin. both of these antibiotics are bacteriostatic, and therefore may have a more limited effect than a bactericidal agent such as chlorhexidine. the lactobacillus strains tested required higher concentrations of chlorhexidine than did the strains of streptococcus for a killing effect in vitro.

AB  == lactic bacteria predominate in the microflora of the digestive tract of chicken and turkey. they are represented mainly by lactobacillus acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. fermentum and l. buchneri. streptococcus faecium is always isolated. l. ruminis, l. vitulinus, l. delbrueckii, l. coryniformis and l. viridescens were found in this ecological niche for the first time. s. faecium and s. faecalis prevail in the digestive tract of geese and ducks, while lactobacilli are detected in a lesser amount and are represented mainly by l. plantarum. l. salivarius cells isolated from the digestive tract of poultry are highly polymorphous. most of the lactic acid bacteria found in the digestive tract of poultry can grow at 45-50 degrees c whatever is the species they belong  to.

TI  == genetic transformation in lactobacillus sp. strain 100-33 of the capacity to colonize the nonsecreting gastric epithelium in mice.
AB  == lactobacillus isolates able to colonize the surfaces of the nonsecreting epithelia in the stomachs of monoassociated ex-germfree mice were derived from lactobacillus acidophilus 100-33. strain 100-33 was originally isolated from pig  feces and is unable to colonize the murine gastric epithelium. in experiments involving attempts genetically to transform the capacity to colonize the epithelium, cells of strain 100-33 were treated with muralytic enzymes and mixed  with polyethylene glycol and genomic or plasmid dna extracted from lactobacillus  fermentum ri. strain ri was originally isolated from a conventional mouse and has the capacity to colonize the nonsecreting gastric epithelium. the mixtures containing cells, polyethylene glycol, and dna were plated on a regeneration medium. after overnight incubation, the cells were washed from the plates and introduced by gastric gavage into germfree mice. only mice that received regenerated 100-33 cells previously mixed with genomic dna from strain ri had layers of gram-positive bacteria on the keratinized epithelia of their stomachs.  six isolates cultured from the washed gastric tissues of these animals were characterized. when a culture of each or a pool of cultures of the six were orally administered to germfree mice, layers of gram-positive bacterial cells were visible on the keratinized gastric epithelia of the animals within 1 to 3 weeks. cells of all six, but not of strain 100-33, reacted with antibody made in  rabbits to l. fermentum ri cells, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. nevertheless, all six had fermentation profiles identical to that of strain 100-33.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == identification of vaginal lactobacilli from asymptomatic women.
AB  == in the present work, carried out by means of phenotypic and genotypic tests, it has been demonstrated that none of the vaginal lactobacilli isolated from asymptomatic women were genetically close to l. acidophilus atcc 4356. strains of homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus gasseri, l. jensenii and l. crispatus, while in the heterofermentative only one strain was classified as l. fermentum. moreover a genetically homologous group of heterofermentative lactobacilli, that could represent a new species, were evidenced.

TI  == conjugal transfer of plasmid-encoded determinants for bacteriocin production and  immunity in lactobacillus acidophilus 88.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus 88 produced a bacteriocin, designated lactacin f, that  demonstrated inhibitory activity toward l. acidophilus 6032, l. lactis 970, l. helveticus 87, l. bulgaricus 1489, l. leichmanii 4797, l. fermentum 1750, and streptococcus faecalis 19433. production of lactacin f was ph dependent and could be maximized in mrs broth cultures maintained at ph 7.0. lactacin f was heat stable and sensitive to ficin, proteinase k, trypsin, and bacillus subtilis protease. l. acidophilus 88 harbored plasmids of 4 and 27 megadaltons. variants of l. acidophilus 88 which were deficient in lactacin f production (laf) and lactacin f immunity (laf) retained the two resident plasmids. a laf laf derivative, l. acidophilus 89, was used as a recipient in agar surface mating experiments with l. acidophilus 88 (laf laf). two types of laf laf transconjugants were recovered. one type (t-e) had acquired two plasmids of 68 (ppm68) and 52 (ppm52) megadaltons that were not detected in either the conjugal  donor or the other type of laf laf transconjugants (t-89). laf and laf were unstable in the plasmid-bearing transconjugant. plasmid analysis of laf laf variants revealed that ppm52 and ppm68 were cured with loss of laf and laf. bacteriocin production and immunity phenotypes were genetically stable in laf laf transconjugants not harboring ppm52 and ppm68, suggesting chromosomal integration of the transferred determinants. the data demonstrated intragenic conjugation in  l. acidophilus and provided direct evidence for involvement of transient plasmid  determinants in laf and laf.

TI  == in vitro adherence of lactobacillus species to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus isolated from three  commercial yogurts were compared to l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. cellobiosus, and l. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from american type culture collection cultures. l. acidophilus isolated from lactinex tablets was also tested. no significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the american type culture collection cultures, and the lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.

TI  == reverse effect of gram-positive bacteria vs. gram-negative bacteria on adjuvant-induced arthritis in germfree rats.
AB  == germfree (gf) f344 rats developed severe adjuvant-induced arthritis with a 100% incidence after a single intradermal injection of heat-killed mycobacterium bovis (bcg). specific pathogene-free (spf) rats developed less severe arthritis with a  lower incidence. the rats colonized with escherichia coli or bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in spf rats. the rats colonized with bifidobacterium, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus casei, l. fermentum, l. murini, and l. acidophilus developed more severe disease than that in gf rats. furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of e. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in spf rats. these results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as e. coli and bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of spf rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as bifidobacterium, p. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and e. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.

TI  == [adhesive properties of lactobacilli isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract].
AB  == the adhesive and hemagglutinating properties of 34 tribes of lactobacillus have been examined. 21 tribes came from human saliva and feces. 23.5% of the tribes showed strongly, 50% weakly adhesive properties. the remaining tribes showed average effects. most of the strongly adhering tribes were isolates from human specimens. in the group of weakly adhering tribes those from collections dominated. 4 of 9 examined species differed in their adhering capacity. these were l. acidophilus, l. salivarius, l. casei, and l. fermentum. only weakly adhering tribes showed hemagglutination of human erythrocytes. therefore, there exists obviously, a reversed relation between the adhering and the hemagglutinating properties of lactobacilli.

TI  == the adherence of lactic acid bacteria to the columnar epithelial cells of pigs and calves.
AB  == the adhesion of various lactobacilli and streptococci to columnar epithelial cells of pigs and calves were studied, by in vitro methods. the porcine strains isolated most frequently were lactobacillus delbrueckii, lact, acidophilus and lact. fermentum. thirteen of the 22 lactobacilli were adhesive. all the streptococci isolated belonged to lancefield's d-group; none of them adhered to pig epithelial cells. the adhesive strains (9 of 22) of calves were identified as lact. fermentum. adherence was variable even between strains of the same species. isolates from plant material, cultured milk and cheese did not adhere to the columnar epithelial cells in vitro. the adhesive porcine strains tolerated low ph and bile acids, which is important for their survival under conditions in the stomach and intestine.

TI  == detection and activity of lactacin b, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == a total of 52 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus were examined for production of bacteriocins. a majority (63%) demonstrated inhibitory activity against all members of a four-species grouping of lactobacillus leichmannii, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus lactis. four l. acidophilus strains with this activity also inhibited streptococcus faecalis and  lactobacillus fermentum, suggesting a second system of antagonism. under conditions eliminating the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, no inhibition of other gram-positive or -negative genera was demonstrated by l. acidophilus. the agent produced by l. acidophilus n2 and responsible for inhibition of l. leichmannii, l. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, and l. lactis was investigated. ultrafiltration studies indicated a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 for the crude inhibitor. the agent was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 60 min at 100 degrees c (ph  5). activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. these characteristics identified the inhibitory agent as a bacteriocin, designated lactacin b. examination of strains of l. acidophilus within the six homology groupings of johnson et al. (int. j. syst. bacteriol. 30:53-68, 1980) demonstrated that production of the bacteriocin lactacin b could not be used in classification of neotype l. acidophilus strains. however, the usefulness of employing sensitivity to lactacin b in classification of dairy lactobacilli is suggested.

TI  == a phylogenetic analysis of lactobacilli, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc  mesenteroides.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus, l. helveticus, l. lactis, l. brevis, l. plantarum, l.  ruminis, l. casei, l. bifermentans, l. viridescens, l. fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides have been characterized by oligonucleotide cataloguing of their 16 s ribosomal rnas. all lactobacillus species investigated together with p. pentosaceus and l. mesenteroides form a phylogenetically coherent and ancient group. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus is  the only closely related pair of species; all other species are only remotely related among each other, indicating that they are well-defined species. lactobacillus, together with streptococcus and bacillus, constitute a super-cluster within the 'clostridium' sub-branch of gram-positive eubacteria showing a low guanine plus cytosine content of their deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == immunisation of rhesus monkeys with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid for protection against dental caries.
AB  == an attempt was made to protect rhesus monkeys from dental caries by immunisation  with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus and lipoteichoic acid (lta). the vaccine composed of s. mutans gave significant protection against caries, a decrease in the number of s. mutans, an increase in igg antibodies and a moderate increase in complement-fixing antibodies to lta. when lta was used as immunogen,  there was only a small reduction in caries, without any detectable antibodies to  lta and a slight increase in igg antibodies to cell of s. mutans. vaccines of l.  acidophilus or l. fermentum gave no protection. a combined vaccine of s. mutans and l. acidophilus did not reduce the incidence of caries but the antibody titre  to cells of s. mutans was raised to a level comparable with that in the s. mutans-immunised monkeys. the results of this investigation in a subhuman primate confirm that immunisation with s. mutans induces protection against caries, unlike the attempt to immunise with two selected strains of lactobacilli. more studies are required to establish the role of specific serotypes of lactobacilli  in the development of dental caries.

TI  == in vitro studies on distribution of indigenous lactobacilli of the gastrointestinal tract of rats.
AB  == to learn the biochemical mechanisms controlling the distribution of indigenous lactobacilli in the gastrointestinal tracts of rats, the effect of ph and stomach and cecal contents on lactobacillus distribution was investigated in vitro with a mixed culture of three lactobacillus strains isolated from the rat intestine. the ph of the growth medium affected the growth of lactobacilli strongly, irrespective of the lumenal contents. lactobacillus fermentum outnumbered l. acidophilus and l. murini at low ph (ph 4.5; average ph of stomach contents of conventional rats) but at near neutral ph (ph 6.5; average ph of cecal contents of conventional rats), the growth of l. murini was predominant with all strains.  more lactic acid was formed by lactobacilli in medium consisting of stomach contents than in cecal contents medium. l. murini grew in the nondialyzable fraction of the stomach contents and l. fermentum grew in the dialyzable fraction, but l. acidophilus did not grow in either fraction. l. murini grew in the nondialyzable fraction treated with hyaluronidase. in contrast, the nondialyzable fraction treated with pronase or chondroitinase did not allow l. murini to grow at all.

TI  == changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
