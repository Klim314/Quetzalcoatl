TI  == the effect of blue light on periodontal biofilm growth in vitro.
AB  == we have previously shown that blue light eliminates the black-pigmented oral bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and prevotella melaninogenica. in the present study, the in vitro photosensitivity of the above black-pigmented microorganisms and four fusobacteria species (fusobacterium nucleatum ss. nucleatum, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, f. nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum) was investigated in pure cultures and human dental plaque suspensions. we also tested the hypothesis that phototargeting the above eight key periodontopathogens in plaque-derived biofilms in vitro would control growth within the dental biofilm environment. cultures of the eight bacteria were exposed to blue light at 455 nm  with power density of 80 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 4.8 j/cm2. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of bacteria was performed to demonstrate the presence and amounts of porphyrin molecules within microorganisms. suspensions of human dental plaque bacteria were also exposed once to blue light  at 455 nm with power density of 50 mw/cm2 and energy fluence of 12 j/cm2. microbial biofilms developed from the same plaque were exposed to 455 nm blue light at 50 mw/cm2 once daily for 4 min (12 j/cm2) over a period of 3 days (4 exposures) in order to investigate the cumulative action of phototherapy on the eight photosensitive pathogens as well as on biofilm growth. bacterial growth was evaluated using the colony-forming unit (cfu) assay. the selective phototargeting of pathogens was studied using whole genomic probes in the checkerboard dna-dna format. in cultures, all eight species showed significant growth reduction (p < 0.05). hplc demonstrated various porphyrin patterns and amounts of porphyrins in  bacteria. following phototherapy, the mean survival fractions were reduced by 28.5 and 48.2 % in plaque suspensions and biofilms, respectively, (p < 0.05). dna probe analysis showed significant reduction in relative abundances of the eight bacteria as a group in plaque suspensions and biofilms. the cumulative blue light treatment suppressed biofilm growth in vitro. this may introduce a new avenue of  prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  == the effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. light with a power density of 70 mw/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard dna probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. the proportions of black-pigmented species porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on  the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. these species were streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, and capnocytophaga sputigena. at the same time, the percentage of  gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. no adverse effects were found or reported in this study. the present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == [expression of cytokines in dentogingival sulcus in patients after dental implantation and during development of peri-implantitis].
AB  == aim: determination of cytokine content in various areas of dentition in patients  with peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of i and ii order. materials and methods: 32 patients with complications that developed in 3 months to 14 years after installation of intraosteal dental implants were examined. content of cytokines in various areas of dentition was determined by using solid phase enzyme immunoassay in patients with developed peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of i and ii order. multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used for determination of parodontopathogenic bacteria marker dna. results: marker dna of i order parodontopathogenic bacteria - aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia (bacteroides forsythus), porphyromonas gingivalis in peri-implantation tissues during implant rejection was detected with 34.4 - 75% frequency while ii order (prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, parvimonas micros (peptostreptococcus micros), fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum etc.) - with significantly lower frequency. total concentration of il- 1beta, il-4, il-6, il-8, tnfalpha, il- 17a and infgamma in contents of pathological pocket in the area of implants and the levels of each of them were significantly higher than in the contents of parodontal pockets, areas  with stable implants and gingival fluid from areas with healthy teeth. total interleukin content in the contents of pathological pockets in the area of rejected implants was significantly higher than in other studied areas. in the exudate of parodontal pockets of the preserved teeth it was 2.4 times lower, in the area of stable implants - 4.6 times lower, and in the areas with healthy teeth - 4.8 times lower than with rejected implants (p<0.05). conclusion: the results of the study conducted allow to make a conclusion regard- ing reasonability of monitoring during dental implantation of parodontopathogenic microorganism strains and local cytokine response of the host organism with the objective of rational prophylaxis and therapy of inflammatory complications.

TI  == co-localized or randomly distributed? pair cross correlation of in vivo grown subgingival biofilm bacteria quantified by digital image analysis.
AB  == the polymicrobial nature of periodontal diseases is reflected by the diversity of phylotypes detected in subgingival plaque and the finding that consortia of suspected pathogens rather than single species are associated with disease development. a number of these microorganisms have been demonstrated in vitro to  interact and enhance biofilm integration, survival or even pathogenic features. to examine the in vivo relevance of these proposed interactions, we extended the  spatial arrangement analysis tool of the software daime (digital image analysis in microbial ecology). this modification enabled the quantitative analysis of microbial co-localization in images of subgingival biofilm species, where the biomass was confined to fractions of the whole-image area, a situation common for medical samples. selected representatives of the disease-associated red and orange complexes that were previously suggested to interact with each other in vitro (tannerella forsythia with fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis with prevotella intermedia) were chosen for analysis and labeled with  specific fluorescent probes via fluorescence in situ hybridization. pair cross-correlation analysis of in vivo grown biofilms revealed tight clustering of f. nucleatum/periodonticum and t. forsythia at short distances (up to 6 microm) with a pronounced peak at 1.5 microm. while these results confirmed previous in vitro observations for f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, random spatial distribution was detected between p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the in vivo samples. in conclusion, we successfully employed spatial arrangement analysis on the single cell level in clinically relevant medical samples and demonstrated the utility of this approach for the in vivo validation of in vitro observations by analyzing statistically relevant numbers of different patients. more importantly, the culture-independent nature of this approach enables similar quantitative analyses for "as-yet-uncultured" phylotypes which cannot be characterized in vitro.

TI  == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB  == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in  the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola  and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic  bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == colonization pattern of periodontal bacteria in japanese children and their mothers.
AB  == background and objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the time of  infection by anaerobic gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, and to clarify their transmission from mother to child. material and methods: seventy-eight japanese children (including 10 siblings), aged from 3 to 9 years,  and 68 mothers, were enrolled in this study. colonization by 11 periodontal bacterial species was determined using polymerase chain reaction amplification of samples of subgingival plaque obtained from the children and their mothers. results: the detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola increased in children after the age of 6 years. we found  a high consistency in colonization by p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in 9 of the 10 siblings. the average number  of bacterial species in plaque samples harboring fusobacterium nucleatum and/or fusobacterium periodonticum was significantly greater than in those without, in both children and mothers. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, campylobacter rectus and t. denticola in children was consistent with that in the mother. conclusion: periodontal bacterial colonization in japanese children increased with age and was associated with f. nucleatum and/or periodonticum, and the bacterial flora in children was similar to that in their mothers.

TI  == comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  == studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) sampling methods. the purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and gcf samples using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. a total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. the mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (sd+/-4.7). on average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (sd+/-2.9). the  proportion of streptococcus oralis (p<0.02) and fusobacterium periodonticum (p<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). the gcf samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). the proportions of tannerella forsythia (t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola were both higher in gcf samples (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). the microbial  composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of porphyromonas gingivalis. a combination of gcf and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of acute periradicular abscesses by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses of endodontic origin by using a molecular genetic method. study design: pus was collected by aspiration from 27 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 49 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with ubiquitous bacterial 16s  rrna gene primers. results: the results of the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis revealed that 37 of the 49 dna probes tested were reactive with one or more samples. the number of bacterial species in the pus samples ranged from 1 to 33 (mean, 5.9). eighteen of the 27 pus samples were positive for at least one dna probe. the most prevalent species found were: bacteroides forsythus (29.6% of the cases); porphyromonas gingivalis (29.6%); streptococcus constellatus (25.9%), prevotella intermedia (22.2%), prevotella nigrescens (22.2%), fusobacterium periodonticum (18.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (18.5%), and  eikenella corrodens (18.5%). conclusions: the microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods could provide additional knowledge regarding the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses by detecting  bacterial species that are difficult--or even impossible--to grow.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == microbiological parameters associated with il-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

AB  == in a multicenter study of the effects of tetracycline (tc) fiber therapy, subgingival plaque samples were tested for 6 probable periodontal pathogens by dna probe analysis. levels of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, prevotella intermedia (bacteroides intermedius), and wolinella recta were quantitatively determined in samples taken at baseline, and immediately after tc  fiber removal, control fiber removal, and scaling and root planing. at untreated  sites, samples were taken at baseline and 10 d later. specificity of the dna probe method was evaluated by testing the hybridization to 83 reference cultures. interaction of the f. nucleatum probe with fusobacterium periodonticum, and of the w. recta probe with wolinella curva were the only cross-hybridizations noted. species were detected at an average sensitivity of 2.9 x 10(4) organisms per sample. approximately 70% of sites were initially infected with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum; 50% with p. intermedia and e. corrodens; infections with w. recta and a. actinomycetemcomitans were less common (36% and 11% respectively). the average numbers of organisms found in the plaque samples were highest for f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia (ca. 10(6)). e. corrodens, w. recta,  and a. actinomycetemcomitans occurred at 10-fold lower levels. bacterial numbers  and proportions of species in subgingival sites from the five centers did not differ appreciably. both tc fiber therapy and scaling decreased the number of sites infected with all the monitored species. the bacterial composition at untreated sites and at sites where control fibers were placed was not significantly altered. the percentage reduction of the number of sites with detectable infection varied with each species: from 86% with w. recta to approximately 40% with p. gingivalis. significant reduction of pocket depth and bleeding occurred at tc fiber-treated sites infected with each of the species. significant attachment level gain occurred only at sites initially infected with  p. gingivalis and treated with tc fibers.
