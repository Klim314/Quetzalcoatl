TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == enzymatic treatment of specimens before dna extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  == introduction: biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by dna amplification techniques (pcr). moreover the targeted dna has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein  matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. the goal of the present work was  to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make  dna available for further extraction and amplification. methods: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, aspergillus niger and fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase k; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase k. dnas was manually extracted using the qiamp dna mini kit or the magna pure compact automate. dna extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid herpesvirus. bacterial detection was performed using taqman real-time pcr and yeasts and filamentous fungi with hrm (real-time pcr followed by high-resolution melting analysis). results: viral dna was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. either the manual or the automatic dna extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for fungi and proteinase k for bacteria. the addition of lyticase and proteinase k did not improve results. for fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for proteinase k, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. discussion: columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting dna and separate pcr inhibitors. detection rates cannot be related to dna-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == microbiological etiology and susceptibility of bacterial conjunctivitis isolates  from clinical trials with ophthalmic, twice-daily besifloxacin.
AB  == introduction: bacterial conjunctivitis is a contagious infection of the surface of the eye usually treated empirically with topical antibiotics. since the etiologic agent is rarely identified, it is important to monitor which bacteria cause conjunctivitis and determine their antibacterial resistance profiles. methods: a total of 496 bacterial samples were isolated during a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in the united states with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% dosed twice daily. species were determined by standard biochemical and/or molecular identification methods.  minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to clinical and laboratory standards institute standards. results: the most prevalent species was haemophilus influenzae, followed by staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus mitis group, and streptococcus pneumoniae. one species  identified in this study, which was not previously noted as a common cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, was dolosigranulum pigrum. ampicillin resistance was common among h. influenzae isolates, while macrolide resistance was high among s. pneumoniae, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. the latter two species also included a number of isolates resistant to methicillin and ciprofloxacin. conclusion: antibiotic resistance among isolates remains a concern and the appearance of an emerging ocular pathogen, d. pigrum, suggests the need for continued observation. the topical ophthalmic fluoroquinolones continue to provide a good balance of low to moderate (i.e., manageable) levels of resistance plus broad-spectrum coverage  for empiric treatment of ocular infections.

TI  == bacterial and fungal microflora in surgically removed lung cancer samples.
AB  == background: clinical and experimental data suggest an association between the presence of bacterial and/or fungal infection and the development of different types of cancer, independently of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. this has also  been postulated for the development of lung cancer, however the prevalence and the exact species of the bacteria and fungi implicated, have not yet been described. aim: to determine the presence of bacterial and fungal microflora in surgically extracted samples of patients with lung cancer. materials and methods: in this single-center prospective, observational study, tissue samples were surgically extracted from 32 consecutive patients with lung cancer, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to identify the presence of bacteria and fungi strains. results: the analysis of the electrophoresis data pointed out diversity between the samples and the strains that were identified. mycoplasma strains were identified in all samples. strains  that appeared more often were staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis and bacillus strains, followed in descending frequency by chlamydia, candida, listeria, and haemophilus influenza. in individual patients legionella pneumophila and candida tropicalis were detected. conclusions: a diversity of pathogens could be identified in surgically extracted tissue samples of patients  with lung cancer, with mycoplasma strains being present in all samples. these results point to an etiologic role for chronic infection in lung carcinogenesis.  confirmation of these observations and additional studies are needed to further characterize the etiologic role of inflammation in lung carcinogenesis.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == prevalence of resistance phenotypes and genotypes to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics in gram-positive cocci isolated in tunisian bone marrow transplant center.
AB  == to investigate the prevalence of resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics in gram-positive cocci isolated in a bone marrow  transplant center of tunisia, we tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 172 clinical isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecium to macrolide erythromycin and spiramycin, the lincosamide clindamycin and the streptogramin pristinamycin. these three groups of organisms  were mostly resistant to macrolides and lincosamide, but were commonly susceptible to pristinamycin. the resistance phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant isolates were determined by the five-disc test with erythromycin, spiramycin, lincomycin, clindamycin and pristinamycin, which showed that most exhibited constitutive mls resistance. in order to determine the prevalence of the resistance genotypes and the resistance mechanisms, the prevalence of the erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) (a), erm(b), erm(c), msr(a) and macrolide efflux (mef) (a) genes in the erythromycin-resistant isolates was identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis. the resistance was due mainly to the presence of ermb in e. faecium (80%), ermc in s. epidermidis (53%) and mefa in s. mitis (65%).

TI  == assessment of the bacterial diversity of human colostrum and screening of staphylococcal and enterococcal populations for potential virulence factors.
AB  == in contrast to breast milk, little is known about the bacterial composition of human colostrum. the objective of this work was to analyze the bacterial diversity of colostrum obtained from healthy women and to characterize the dominant bacterial species for the presence of possible virulence factors. samples of colostrum obtained from 36 healthy women were inoculated into different culture media. several isolates from each medium were selected and identified. staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling. one representative of each profile was included in a genetic and phenotypic characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits/genes and sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were the dominant species, followed by streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes and staphylococcus lugdunensis. among the 48 s. epidermidis isolates selected on the basis of their genetic profiles, the biofilm-related icad gene and the meca gene were detected in only 11 and six isolates, respectively. in parallel, 10 enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cyla, vana, vanb, vand, vane and vang genes. all of them were sensitive to vancomycin. there were no indications that the colostrum samples contained harmful bacteria.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == [clinical results of resection arthroplasty for infected shoulder arthroplasty].
AB  == purpose of the study: infection is a rare complication of shoulder arthroplasty.  various therapeutic solutions have been proposed: antibiotics alone, one-stage or two-stage reimplantation, surgical or arthroscopic cleaning without prosthesis removal, scapulohumeral arthrodesis or simple arthroscopic resection. we evaluated the mid-term clinical outcome after resection arthroplasty for the treatment of infected shoulder arthroplasty. material and methods: the series included ten infected arthroplasties in ten patients. mean duration of implantation was two years seven months (range nine months to five years). bacteriological diagnosis was established from intraoperative articular samples or systematic samples taken during surgical revision procedures: meti-s staphylococcus aureus strains (n=4), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n=5 including three s. epidermidis) streptococcus mitis (n=1) and citrobacter koseri  (n=1). the mean constant score before revision was 58 (range 23-77). subjective patient satisfaction before surgical revision was rated good in six cases, fair in one and poor in three. surgery associated removal of the implant, complete resection of the cement, resection of the fistular tracts, wide debridement of infected tissues and total synovectomy. results: patients were seen at an average follow-up of three years eight months. the objective functional outcome measured  with the constant score was only fair, 28 points (range 20.6-36), and corresponded to a loss of 29 points compared with the preoperative score. this was explained mainly by lower scores for joint motion, function and muscle force  but with persistently satisfactory scores for pain. all patients remained pain-free (daytime and nighttime). patient satisfaction was rated good for two, fair for five and mediocre for three. clinical and biological proof of eradicated infection was obtained in all patients. discussion: infection remains a serious devastating problem for shoulder arthroplasty with an important functional impact. resection only has a modest clinical effect. precise identification of the causal germ with institution of adapted antibiotic therapy is required for eradication of the infection. early diagnosis is probably the most important parameter affecting clinical outcome and surgical options. functional results after resection arthroplasty are modest. this procedure should be reserved for patients with reduced functional demands. improved management of the infectious load and reduction of diagnostic delay should help improve functional outcome and favor use of stow-stage procedures for reinsertion.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  == background: the clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. methods: twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the infectious diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. results: eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. the median age  of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including  2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.  the causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group g streptococci (n = 2 patients), and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). all isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). none of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. conclusions: lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy  should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.

TI  == in-house validation of the bactec 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: at present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the fda for the purpose of quality control (qc) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates: the bact/alert blood culture system (biomerieux) and the pall ebds (pall corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived plts. after the decision of the aabb to institute universal qc testing of plt concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the  performance of our current blood culture system, the bactec 9240, was carried out for this purpose. study design and methods: serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with plt contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis plt unit per organism. four ml of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (cfus) per ml was inoculated into blood culture bottles (standard 10 aerobic/f, becton-dickinson diagnostic systems) and incubated in a bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to  insure the identity of bacterial growth. results: with the exception of streptococcus mitis, the bactec system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 cfus per ml for staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the limit of detection for the  s. mitis test strain was 61 cfus per ml. detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis plt products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. conclusion: this study validates the use of the bactec 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis plts in  less than 24 hours.

TI  == echocardiographic presentations of endocarditis, and risk factors for rupture of  a sinus of valsalva in childhood.
AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == ultrasonic enhancement of antibiotic action on several species of bacteria.
AB  == the effect of the antibiotics gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tetracycline,  and ampicillin on planktonic cultures of enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, salmonella derby, streptococcus mitis, and staphylococcus epidermidis with and without an application of 70 khz ultrasound was studied. the ultrasound  was applied at levels that had no inhibitory effect on planktonic cultures of bacteria. measurements of viability at, above, and below the minimum inhibitory concentration of the above antibiotics on the planktonic cultures of these bacteria showed that a simultaneous application of 70 khz ultrasound and antibiotic significantly increased the effectiveness of selected antibiotics. bacterial viability was reduced several orders of magnitude when harmless levels  of ultrasound were combined with some antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides. similar synergistic effects of combined ultrasound and antibiotic treatment were seen in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with several classes of antibiotics. these results may have application in the treatment of bacterial infections normally resistant to some antibiotics.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == evaluation of swirling, ph, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == in vitro studies on the microbicidal effectiveness of a xenon-based ultraviolet light device for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis connections.
AB  == mercury vapor sourced ultraviolet light has been used for several years to disinfect connections that are integral to peritoneal dialysis solution delivery  systems. this in vitro study evaluated the suitability of xenon flash sourced ultraviolet light as an effective alternative disinfecting agent. candida albicans was determined to be at least four times more resistant than staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mitis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa to ultraviolet radiation generated by both mercury vapor and xenon flash devices. both ultraviolet devices effectively disinfected transfer set spikes that were inoculated intraluminally with each of these five test microorganisms suspended in a pool of patient dialysis effluent. however, ultraviolet (254 nm) absorbance values of dialysis effluent was found to vary greatly between patients, with the most ultraviolet-opaque effluent significantly reducing the microbicidal effectiveness of the mercury vapor, but not the xenon flash system.

TI  == antibacterial and antifungal properties of propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial properties of three glycols, - propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, and 1,3-butylene glycol - against candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes a, streptococcus mitis, and e. coli were studied in vitro. within 20 h, 10% and 30% hexylene glycol in fresh tryptic soy broth were able to kill all the micro-organisms listed above. five percent hexylene glycol showed some antimicrobial properties but the 1% agent had no effect. thirty percent 1,3-butylene glycol and 30% propylene glycol were approximately as effective as 10% hg. the results speak in  favour of using hexylene glycol in cosmetic and dermatological vehicles instead of propylene glycol and 1,3-butylene glycol.

TI  == [the use of teicoplanin in neutropenic patients: values and limits].
AB  == the efficacy and the safety of teicoplanin were evaluated for the treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. a total of 18 patients received teicoplanin once daily as an intravenous injection of 200 mg in 6 patients (after a loading dose of 400 mg) or 400 mg in 12 patients (loading dose: 800 mg). the mean duration of therapy was 15.9 days (range 9 to 39 days). in all patients teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic usually a beta-lactam. thirteen  of 18 patients were successfully treated. three febrile episodes proved to be microbiologically documented infections and were cured by teicoplanin: one streptococcus mitis and two methicillin-resistant (methi-r) staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremias. neither toxicity nor side effects were observed in the reported group. six patients experiencing reactions to vancomycin (2 cases of cutaneous allergy) or to vancomycin and amphotericin b combination (4 cases of nephrotoxicity) were subsequently treated with teicoplanin without any evidence of cross-sensitivity. we observed emergence of teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 3 patients receiving teicoplanin: 20, 18 and 8 days after a first febrile episode cured by teicoplanin and a beta-lactam, they developed fever while receiving the same antibiotic regimen. methi-r staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from blood cultures in the first patient  and methi-r staphylococcus haemolyticus in the two other patients. in one patient, successfully treated by teicoplanin for a first febrile episode related  to a methi-r staphylococcus epidermidis, emergence of staphylococcus haemolyticus occurred 8 days later while the patient was on teicoplanin therapy (6 mg/kg). mics of teicoplanin were 16 mg/l for the two staphylococcus strains isolated in this patient.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by streptococcus mitis.
AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
