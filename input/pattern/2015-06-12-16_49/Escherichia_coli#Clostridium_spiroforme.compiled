TI  - Incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  More than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. Clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for C. difficile enterotoxin. However, 27 cefmetazole-induced diarrheic cases were not associated with C. difficile. Other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter spp., Bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. However, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. This was ascribed to the overgrowth of Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes. There were no remarkable differences in changes in other bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.
TI  - Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1: evidence for induction of actin  assembly by constitutive activation of the p21 Rho GTPase.
AB  - Cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (CNF1) induces in HEp-2 cells an increase in  F-actin structures, which was detectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis 24 h after addition of this factor to the culture medium. Increase in F-actin was correlated with the augmentation of both the cell volume and the total cell actin content. Actin assembly-disassembly is controlled by small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family, which have been reported recently to be modified by CNF1 treatment. Clostridium difficile toxin B and Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3, both known to act on the Rho GTPase, were used as biological tools to study the effect of CNF1 on this protein. CNF1 incubated before, during, or after exposure to the chimeric toxin C3B (which is the product of a genetic fusion between the DNA coding for C3 and the one coding for the B fragment of diphtheria toxin) protected HEp-2 cells from the disruption of F-actin structures caused by inactivation of the Rho GTPase through its ADP-ribosylation. On the other hand, C. difficile toxin B cytopathic effect was not observed upon preincubation of cells with CNF1. Toxins acting through a Rho-independent mechanism, such as cytochalasin D and Clostridium spiroforme iota-like toxin, could not be modified in their cellular activities by CNF1 treatment. All of our results suggest that CNF1 modifies the Rho molecule, thus probably protecting this GTPase from further bacterial toxin modification.
TI  - Characterization of Clostridium perfringens iota-toxin genes and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The iota toxin which is produced by Clostridium perfringens type E, is a binary toxin consisting of two independent polypeptides: Ia, which is an ADP-ribosyltransferase, and Ib, which is involved in the binding and internalization of the toxin into the cell. Two degenerate oligonucleotide probes deduced from partial amino acid sequence of each component of C. spiroforme toxin, which is closely related to the iota toxin, were used to clone three overlapping DNA fragments containing the iota-toxin genes from C. perfringens type E plasmid DNA. Two genes, in the same orientation, coding for Ia (387 amino acids) and Ib (875 amino acids) and separated by 243 noncoding nucleotides were identified. A predicted signal peptide was found for each component, and the secreted Ib displays two domains, the propeptide (172 amino acids) and the mature protein (664 amino acids). The Ia gene has been expressed in Escherichia coli and C. perfringens, under the control of its own promoter. The recombinant polypeptide obtained was recognized by Ia antibodies and ADP-ribosylated actin. The expression of the Ib gene was obtained in E. coli harboring a recombinant plasmid encompassing the putative promoter upstream of the Ia gene and the Ia and Ib genes. Two residues which have been found to be involved in the NAD+ binding site of diphtheria and pseudomonas toxins are conserved in the predicted Ia sequence (Glu-14 and Trp-19). The predicted amino acid Ib sequence shows 33.9% identity with and 54.4% similarity to the protective antigen of the anthrax toxin complex. In particular, the central region of Ib, which contains a predicted transmembrane segment (Leu-292 to Ser-308), presents 45% identity with the corresponding protective antigen sequence which is involved in the translocation of the toxin across the cell membrane.
TI  - The enteritis complex in domestic rabbits: A field study.
AB  - A study of the causative agents of enteritis in domestic rabbits from 44 different accessions is described. In descending order of frequency, the organisms most commonly demonstrated were intestinal and hepatic coccidia (Eimeria species), Escherichia coli, Clostridium spp., Salmonella, Bacillus piliformis, and rotavirus. The species of Eimeria identified included those moderately pathogenic and coccidia of low pathogenicity. Using seven antisera against known enterpathogenic strains of E. coli, only one strain, O15, was identified in three cases. Clostridium perfringens or C. spiroforme was demonstrated in the intestinal contents in 11 cases, and lesions compatible with clostridial enteropathy were identified on gross and histopathology. In a serological survey, over 50% of 200 fryer rabbits submitted to Ontario abattoirs and of animals from commercial rabbitries had detectable antibody to rotavirus, indicating the widespread distribution of rotaviral infections in this species. In the cases of enteritis studied, two or more potentially pathogenic organisms were frequently identified, emphasizing that several different organisms may be acting in concert to produce clinical disease.
TI  - Significance of Clostridium spiroforme in the enteritis-complex of commercial rabbits.
AB  - Commercial rabbits showing clinical signs of enteritis-complex were examined for  the presence of Clostridium spiroforme and its iota-like toxin. The bacterium was detected by Gram stain in 52.4% of 149 cecal samples and iota-like toxin in 7.4%. From 29 strains of C. spiroforme tested, 26 were toxigenic, originating from 24 of 29 rabbitries. In 13.4% of the samples, C. spiroforme was present as the only known disease agent. Gross and microscopic lesions were similar to those described in the literature. In the other samples, C. spiroforme was associated with attaching effacing Escherichia coli (29.5%), Bacillus piliformis (10.3%), rotaviruses (25.6%), coronavirus (2.6%), Eimeria spp. (44.9%) and cryptosporidia (6.4%). In 33.3% of C. spiroforme-containing samples, more than one of these agents was present. There was no significant difference between the presence of these organisms in C. spiroforme-positive and negative samples. On the basis of these results as well as that of previous data, we suggest that C. spiroforme-mediated diarrhea is favoured by maldigestion, initiated by infectious agents and/or nutritional factors.
