TI  == clinical characteristics of q fever and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia  in a tropical region of southern taiwan: a prospective observational study.
AB  == background: the clinical characteristics of q fever are poorly identified in the  tropics. fever with pneumonia or hepatitis are the dominant presentations of acute q fever, which exhibits geographic variability. in southern taiwan, which is located in a tropical region, the role of q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (cap) has never been investigated. methodology/principal findings: during the study period, may 2012 to april 2013, 166 cases of adult cap and 15 cases of acute q fever were prospectively investigated. cultures of clinical specimens, urine antigen tests for streptococcus pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila, and paired serologic assessments for mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae, and q fever (coxiella burnetii) were used for identifying pathogens associated with cap. from april 2004 to april 2013 (the pre-study period), 122 cases of acute q fever were also included retrospectively  for analysis. the geographic distribution of q fever and cap cases was similar. q fever cases were identified in warmer seasons and younger ages than cap. based on multivariate analysis, male gender, chills, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver  enzymes were independent characteristics associated with q fever. in patients with q fever, 95% and 13.5% of cases presented with hepatitis and pneumonia, respectively. twelve (7.2%) cases of cap were seropositive for c. burnetii antibodies, but none of them had acute q fever. among cap cases, 22.9% had a curb-65 score >==2, and 45.8% had identifiable pathogens. haemophilus parainfluenzae (14.5%), s. pneumoniae (6.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), and  klebsiella pneumoniae (3.0%) were the most common pathogens identified by cultures or urine antigen tests. moreover, m. pneumoniae, c. pneumoniae, and co-infection with 2 pathogens accounted for 9.0%, 7.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. conclusions: in southern taiwan, q fever is an endemic disease with hepatitis as  the major presentation and is not a common etiology of cap.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against bacterial isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the asia-pacific region and south africa (2010).
AB  == ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against resistant gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, and common gram-negative organisms, including wild-type enterobacteriaceae. we evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) and community-acquired respiratory tract infections (carti) in the asia-pacific region and south africa. a total of 2351 isolates, 1100 from ssti and 1251 from carti, were collected from 25 medical centers distributed across 8 countries as part of the 2010 aware ceftaroline surveillance program and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. ceftaroline was very active against s. aureus (mic50/90, 0.25/1 mug/ml; 93.4% susceptible), including  mrsa (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml; 80.6% susceptible). against beta-hemolytic streptococci, ceftaroline demonstrated greater activity (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) than penicillin (mic90, 0.06 mug/ml). ceftaroline was also highly active against  viridans group streptococci (mic90, 0.12 mug/ml). similarly to ceftriaxone, ceftaroline activity against escherichia coli (mic50/90, >32/>32 mug/ml) and klebsiella spp. (mic50/90, 0.12/>32 mug/ml) was compromised by the high prevalence of isolates with an esbl phenotype in the region, particularly in china. ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam tested against s. pneumoniae (mic50/90 of 0.015/0.25 mug/ml; 99.8% susceptible by clinical and laboratory standards institute [clsi] criteria), and it was also highly potent against haemophilus influenzae (mic50/90, </= 0.008/0.03 mug/ml; 100% susceptible by clsi criteria). ceftaroline was also active against h. parainfluenzae (mic50/90, </= 0.008/0.015 mug/ml) and moraxella catarrhalis (mic50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml). in summary, ceftaroline showed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates (2351) associated with ssti and carti from the asia-pacific region and south africa.

TI  == [distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection].
AB  == objective: to study the distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection (ari) in dalian. methods: between  january 2006 and february 2007, 930 children with ari were enrolled, including 364 with acute upper respiratory infection (auri), and 566 with acute lower respiratory infection (alri). the auri children, who did not receive antimicrobial agent treatment or received oral antimicrobial agents 1-2 times, had bacterial cultures of pharyngeal swab. the alri children, who received intravenous antibacterial agents more than 3 days, had bacterial cultures of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf). isolated bacteria were identified by the atb system (bio-merieux, france). antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of kirby-bauer. results: a total of 404 isolates (43.4%) were identified. haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 22.5%, 12.1% and 7.4% respectively. in the isolates from auri, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 43.9%, 22.0% and 9.1% respectively; escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and nonfermenters accounted for 4.5%, 8.3% and 3.0% respectively. in the isolates from alri, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 12.1%, 7.4% and 6.6% respectively; escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and nonfermenters  accounted for 16.9%, 13.2% and 21.8% respectively. the resistant rates of haemophilus to ampicillin and tmp-smz were 29.3% and 32.9% respectively, and to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefalotin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and cefotaxime were  12.1%, 10.0%, 10.0%, 11.4% and 5.7%, respectively. the resistant rate of haemophilus to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, tetracycine and tmp-smz in the alri group were significantly higher than that in the auri group (p<0.05 or 0.01). conclusions: in dalian, haemophilus was the main isolate of children with ari. the distribution of bacteria was different between alri and auri. in alri, gram-negative bacilli were in a higher proportion, and the resistant rates of haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefaclor were higher.

TI  == effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  == the activity of eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of s. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of s. agalactiae, 20 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of h. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. the cytotoxicity was evaluated on  vero cells by the mtt test. the antibacterial activity was evaluated by the kirby bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. h. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and s. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by s. pneumoniae. the antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild  activity on mumps virus.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe copd with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe copd, were enrolled in the study. all of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly.  patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (aecopd). three of these patients presented two episodes  of aecopd. patients with an acute exacerbation of copd received azithromycin 500  mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. in 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of aecopd with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment).  bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy  were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). azithromycin eradicated all isolates of haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, h. parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. eradication of sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an aecopd is caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. this finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.

TI  == amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release tablets: a new antimicrobial for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections are among the most common health disorders requiring medical care and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and direct and indirect costs. recent increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have resulted in reduced susceptibility of the most common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens to a number of antimicrobials. amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release (er) tablets (augmentin xr, glaxosmithkline) is a new formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate that retains activity against betalactamase-producing organisms whilst increasing the activity against streptococcus pneumoniae through elevated and sustained plasma amoxicillin concentrations. the bilayer tablet provides immediate release of clavulanate and both immediate and sustained release of amoxicillin to maintain therapeutic concentrations of amoxicillin over longer periods of the dosing interval. in clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (abs) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap), amoxicillin/clavulanate er was shown to have excellent bacteriological and clinical success rates, even in patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and was found to be  generally well tolerated. amoxicillin/clavulanate er is approved in the us for the treatment of patients with abs or cap caused by beta-lactamase-producing pathogens (ie, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus  aureus) and s. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 microg/ml).

TI  == haemophilus parainfluenzae and fusobacterium necrophorum liver abscess: a case report.
AB  == liver abscess is a potentially life-threatening disease. the clinical features of pyogenic liver abscess are variable and probably correlate with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms and underlying diseases that may be involved. the most  common pathogen of liver abscess in taiwan is klebsiella pneumoniae. diabetes mellitus and hepatobiliary calculus are major diseases associated with liver abscess. haemophilus parainfluenzae is a commensal of the upper respiratory tract, but is an uncommon isolate in liver abscess. we describe a 44-year-old man with liver abscess caused by mixed h. parainfluenzae and fusobacterium necrophorum infection. he received percutaneous liver abscess drainage and intravenous antibiotic therapy for 3 weeks and fully recovered. no recurrence occurred during the follow-up period of 4 months.

TI  == the efficacy and safety of two oral moxifloxacin regimens compared to oral clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == an international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (cap). the clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3-5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. clinical success rates were  maintained at follow-up, 21-28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). the 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating cap. at follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. the most frequently isolated pathogens were streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), haemophilus influenzae (19%), haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), moraxella catarrhalis (6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and  staphylococcus aureus (4%). the bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. the adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. in all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of cap. bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater  than those of clarithromycin. moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == respiratory pathogens: assessing resistance patterns in europe and the potential  role of grepafloxacin as treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms.
AB  == although most respiratory tract infections (rti) are caused by viruses, various bacteria, particularly streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with rti must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of s. pneumoniae from france and spain. uniquely, in italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. in 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 european countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. the mic(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of s. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/l, the mics for only five strains being >2  mg/l, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations </=0.5 mg/l. the mic(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of h. influenzae and  323 of haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/l, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of m. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/l. the mic(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of legionella pneumophila (mic(90) 0.015 mg/l), mycoplasma pneumoniae (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l) and chlamydia pneumoniae (mics 0.06-0.12 mg/l). current susceptibility data indicate  that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in european countries. the enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of s. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of rti.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-negative  bacilli in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes and proteus mirabilis showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to fosfomycin (fom) and citrobacter freundii. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes showed slightly increasing tendency to minocycline (mino). while haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae showed slightly decreasing tendency to cefmetazole (cmz). however, these annual changes were almost negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st), cmz, latamoxef (lmox), gentamicin (gm) and amikacin (amk) showed good activities against some of the gram-negative bacilli to which no indications are approved. in conclusion, bedside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents) could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of antimicrobial agents is necessary.

TI  == sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, comparative study. sparfloxacin multicenter abecb study group.
AB  == study objective: comparison of efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abecb). design: multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. setting: sixty-eight private offices and outpatient clinics in the united states and canada. patients: seven hundred ninety-eight adults with abecb, as confirmed by the acute onset of new (or worsened from the immediate premorbid state) cough and sputum production. interventions: randomization 1:1 to sparfloxacin, 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg once daily, or ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily, with matching comparator placebos,  given concurrently for 10 consecutive days. results: the primary efficacy parameter was overall response in the bacteriologically evaluable population. overall success rates in this population were 85.3% and 89.3% for sparfloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. the two-sided 95% confidence interval was -9.9, 1.9, indicating that sparfloxacin was statistically equivalent to ofloxacin. the all-treated population analysis was similar to that in the evaluable population.  bacterial eradication rates were similar in both treatment groups for haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and staphylococcus aureus. the frequency of adverse events overall was comparable in the two treatment groups. the sparfloxacin group had a lower frequency of digestive and nervous system adverse events, but a higher frequency  of photosensitivity reactions than the ofloxacin group. conclusions: once-daily oral treatment with 200 mg sparfloxacin (after initial 400 mg dose) is as effective as twice-daily treatment with 400 mg ofloxacin in patients with abecb.

TI  == a multicentre collaborative study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired, lower respiratory tract pathogens 1992-1993: the alexander project.
AB  == the alexander project is a unique, international, collaborative antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study of bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection. fifteen centres, ten in the european union (eu) and five in the usa, each submitted up to 400 isolated per year for 2 years (1992 and 1993) to a central laboratory for re-identification and determination of mics of 15 antimicrobials using the sensititre microbroth incorporation technique. of the total of 6385 isolates collected, haemophilus influenzae (2718), streptococcus pneumoniae (1856) and moraxella catarrhalis (818) were the most frequently identified pathogens. staphylococcus aureus (690). haemophilus parainfluenzae (183) and klebsiella pneumoniae (120) were identified  less commonly. high-level penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae (mic > or = 2 mg/l) was found in 222 isolates, an overall prevalence of 12% which varied from < 1% in germany, italy, uk and two of the five usa centres, to 3.8-40.4% in the remainder, with the highest prevalence found in france and spain. intermediate penicillin resistance (mic 0.12-1 mg/l) was identified in 228 isolates of s. pneumoniae, an overall prevalence of 12.3%, with individual centre prevalence varying widely (eu, 0-52.3%; usa, 0-20.9%) and not always following that of high-level resistance. resistance to other, unrelated, antimicrobials, except notably the fluoroquinolones, was strongly associated with beta-lactam resistance. beta-lactamase production was detected in 492 isolates of h. influenzae, an overall prevalence of 18.1%. rates of detection varied widely between centres from 1.4% in weingarten, germany in 1993 to 38.5% in barcelona, spain in 1992. in general, the prevalence of beta-lactamase production was higher and less variable in usa centres than in those of the eu. beta-lactamase was detected consistently in the majority of isolates of m. catarrhalis with an overall prevalence of 81.7%. virtually no other resistance phenotype was recognised in this species. of the 690 collected, most isolates of s. aureus produced beta-lactamase with rates of detection varying from 52.2%-89.1%. isolates from two centres, genoa, italy in 1992 and paris, france in 1993, were associated with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistance (34.8% and 43.8%, respectively). combined isolates of h. parainfluenzae and k. pneumoniae accounted for only 4.7% of the total collection. although the current data are insufficient to allow analysis of trends in resistance, the study participants have continued  to collect further isolates in 1994 and 1995 which will be reported in the future.

TI  == cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. the in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. cefetamet killed 100% haemophilus influenzae and h. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing  strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae at < or =  0.5 mg/l, s. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l.  moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective  against escherichia coli (94%), klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), k. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x mic demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing h.  influenzae, m. catarrhalis, and k. pneumoniae within 6 h and s. pneumoniae within 4 h. hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to tem1 and shv1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.

TI  == [a study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) is a combination drug of papm, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and bp, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1.  its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. it was superior to imipenem (ipm) in the in  vitro antibacterial activities against haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus including mrsa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. papm had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of ipm against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of ipm. the clinical usefulness of papm/bp was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. in terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of p. aeruginosa remained unchanged. six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. side-effects  were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of s-got and s-gpt were found in 1 case. in conclusion, papm/bp is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.

TI  == treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: state of the art.
AB  == effective treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (abe)  reduces the number of such exacerbations in such patients and may decrease or eliminate background symptoms and improve pulmonary function. the pathologic and  physiologic abnormalities of the bronchial system in chronic bronchitis that predispose to bacterial infection probably include impaired mucociliary clearance, obstructed bronchioles, and bacterial infections of the bronchial epithelium. exacerbations of bronchopulmonary symptoms are usually observed with  abe, although these symptoms are not unique to abe. while culture and sensitivity testing is not usually required, microscopic examination of sputum is critical to determine the presence of bacterial infection. bacteria in numbers significantly  above the levels present when the patient's condition is stable and at least a doubling of the sputum neutrophil inflammatory level are essential criteria. bacterial species observed with abe include haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria species, with a lesser incidence of klebsiella and pseudomonas species. one or more elements of background therapy for abe should accompany antimicrobial therapy, for example, physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and so forth. ampicillin is effective, safe, economical, and thus remains the drug of choice for abe. quinolones are an effective alternative when ampicillin cannot be tolerated or if organisms are resistant. dosing is at the upper range of recommendations, and the chosen drug should be given for a 10-14-day regimen. patients should be reevaluated if symptoms and physical findings do not return to baseline after 5-7 days.

TI  == pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  zimbabwe, central africa.
AB  == during the 11 month period up to 30 september 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. hiv was heterosexually transmitted. predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were  contaminated. pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. endobronchial kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. bacterial pathogens isolated included  staph. aureus (5), s. pneumoniae (5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), haemophilus influenzae (2), h. parainfluenzae (1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). invading aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. no diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. it is concluded that in central africa pulmonary complications in aids patients are similar to those in europe and north america but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. m. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. this study  has confirmed that p. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.

AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

AB  == as a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (cpz), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) when tested against 10 strains of staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of cpz was found to be weaker than that of cez. against 5 strains of a-beta-streptococcus and 4 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both cpz and cez exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. cpz was effective against 18 strains of escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. against 15 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of  haemophilus parahaemolyticus, cpz was found to be more effective than cez though  several high-resistant strains were noted. cpz also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than cez against 4 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae,  5 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of salmonella sp., 4 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of proteus sp. (2) the mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of cpz to three children was 70 minutes. (3) one hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of  cpz to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. in one case,  the csf/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) the average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) eighteen pediatric patients received cpz in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. they were rti in 7, uri in 5, uti in 5, ssss in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. the clinical effectiveness of cpz was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. one patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. the three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of got and gpt, and 1 case of mild elevation of got. all were considered to be minor.

AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
