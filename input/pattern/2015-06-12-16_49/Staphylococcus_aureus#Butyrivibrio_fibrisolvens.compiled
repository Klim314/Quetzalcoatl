TI  - Sequence analysis of small cryptic plasmids isolated from Selenomonas ruminantium S20.
AB  - Two small cryptic plasmids designated pONE429 and pONE430 were isolated from a rumen bacterium, Selenomonas ruminantium S20. The complete sequence of pONE429 was 2100 bp and contained one open reading frame (ORF) of 201 amino acids. The sequence of pONE430 had 1527 bp and one ORF of 171 amino acids with the similarity of replication protein (Rep protein) of pOM1, pSN2, and pIM13 isolated from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. In these plasmids, the upstream nucleotide sequence of Rep protein had the conserved nucleotides which could be double-strand origin (DSO) of rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism. The plasmids of pONE429, pONE430, pJJMI, pJDB21, and pS23 were isolated from S. ruminantium strains and had similar regions that were located within a <450-bp nucleotide. These similar regions may be the location that was recognized by the host strain, S. ruminantium.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of pOM1, a small cryptic plasmid from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for Butyrivibrios.
AB  - As a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of Butyrivibrio plasmid pOM1, which was isolated from B. fibrisolvens Bu49. While it is very similar in size to the previously characterized Butyrivibrio plasmids pRJF1 and pRJF2, pOM1 exhibits a restriction pattern which is quite distinct. Analysis of sequence data reveals that pOM1 contains only two open reading frames of significant length (ORF1 and ORF2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. The protein encoded in ORF1 shows homologies with Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus thuringiensis. The putative translation product of ORF2, on the other hand, resembles Rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the Staphylococcus plasmid pSN2 is a prototype. Unlike the other characterized-Butyrivibrio plasmids, pOM1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. Experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pOM1 has been used in the construction of a new Escherichia coli-B. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, pSMerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into B. fibrisolvens harboring the pRJF1 plasmid.
TI  - A conjugative transfer system for the rumen bacterium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, based on Tn916-mediated transfer of the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB110.
AB  - A limitation of genetic studies of the rumen bacterium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, has been the availability of suitable vectors and transfer systems. Using the conjugative tetracycline resistant transposon, Tn916, the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid, pUB110, and the pUB110-based shuttle vector, pUBLRS, a conjugative transfer system was developed for B. fibrisolvens. B fibrisolvens donor strains H17c2 and H17c12, containing Tn916 and pUB110 or pUBLRS, respectively, were used in mating experiments with selected B. fibrisolvens strains. Kanamycin resistant transconjugants, containing pUB110, of strains 193, 194, and 195 were detected at a combined average frequency of 7.78 x 10(-7) per donor and 1.11 x 10(-5) per recipient. Transconjugants of strains 193 and 194, containing pUBLRS, were detected at an average frequency of 1.22 x 10(-6) per donor and 4.70 x 10(-8) per recipient. Southern hybridization analysis confirmed the presence of pUB110 and pUBLRS in transconjugants. Results indicated that Tn916 was necessary for mobilization of pUB110 as transconjugants were not detected when the transposon was absent from the donor strains. The ability to mobilize pUB110 and pUBLRS between B. fibrisolvens strains provides a conjugative transfer system that circumvents problems encountered with electroporation.
