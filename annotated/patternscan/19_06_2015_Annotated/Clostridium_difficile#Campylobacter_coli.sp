TI  == dbdiasnp: an open-source knowledgebase of genetic polymorphisms and resistance genes related to diarrheal pathogens.
AB  == diarrhea is a highly common infection among children, responsible for significant morbidity and mortality rate worldwide. after pneumonia, diarrhea remains the second leading cause of neonatal deaths. numerous viral, bacterial, and parasitic enteric pathogens are associated with diarrhea. with increasing antibiotic resistance among enteric pathogens, there is an urgent need for global surveillance of the mutations and resistance genes primarily responsible for resistance to antibiotic treatment. single nucleotide polymorphisms are important in this regard as they have a vast potential to be utilized as molecular diagnostics for gene-disease or pharmacogenomics association studies linking genotype to phenotype. dbdiasnp is a comprehensive repository of mutations and resistance genes among various diarrheal pathogens and hosts to advance breakthroughs that will find applications from development of sequence-based diagnostic tools to drug discovery. it contains information about 946 mutations and 326 resistance genes compiled from literature and various web resources. as of march 2015, it houses various pathogen genes and the mutations responsible for antibiotic resistance. the pathogens include, for example, dec (diarrheagenic e.coli), salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., shigella spp., clostridium difficile, aeromonas spp., helicobacter pylori, entamoeba histolytica, vibrio cholera, and viruses. it also includes mutations from hosts (e.g., humans, pigs,  others) that render them either susceptible or resistant to a certain type of diarrhea. dbdiasnp is therefore intended as an integrated open access database for researchers and clinicians working on diarrheal diseases. additionally, we note that the dbdiasnp is one of the first antibiotic resistance databases for the diarrheal pathogens covering mutations and resistance genes that have clinical relevance from a broad range of pathogens and hosts. for future translational research involving integrative biology and global health, the database offers veritable potentials, particularly for developing countries and worldwide monitoring and personalized effective treatment of pathogens associated with diarrhea. the database is accessible on the public domain at http://www.juit.ac.in/attachments/dbdiasnp/ .

TI  == the livestock reservoir for antimicrobial resistance: a personal view on changing patterns of risks, effects of interventions and the way forward.
AB  == the purpose of this review was to provide an updated overview on the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock, the associated problems for humans and current knowledge on the effects of reducing resistance in the livestock reservoir on both human health and animal production. there is still limiting data on both use of antimicrobial agents, occurrence and spread of resistance as well as impact on human health. however, in recent years, emerging issues related to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, escherichia coli and horizontally transferred genes indicates that the livestock reservoir has a more significant impact on human health than was estimated 10 years ago, where the focus was mainly on resistance in campylobacter and salmonella. studies have indicated that there might only be a marginal if any benefit from the regular use of antibiotics and have shown that it is possible to substantially reduce the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock production without compromising animal welfare or health or production. in some cases, this should be done in combination with other measures such as biosecurity and use of vaccines. to enable better studies on both the global burden and the effect of interventions, there is a need for global harmonized integrated and continuous surveillance of antimicrobial usage and antimicrobial resistance, preferably associated with data on production and animal diseases to determine the positive  and negative impact of reducing antimicrobial use in livestock.

TI  == spectrum of enteropathogens detected by the filmarray gi panel in a multicentre study of community-acquired gastroenteritis.
AB  == the european, multicentre, quarterly point-prevalence study of community-acquired diarrhoea (eucodi) analysed stool samples received at ten participating clinical  microbiology laboratories (austria, finland, france, germany, greece, ireland, italy, portugal, romania, and the uk) in 2014. on four specified days, each local laboratory submitted samples from </=20 consecutive patients to the austrian study centre for further testing with the filmarray gi panel (biofire diagnostics, salt lake city, ut, usa). of the 709 samples from as many patients received, 325 (45.8%) tested negative, 268 (37.8%) yielded only one organism, and 116 (16.4%) yielded multiple organisms. positivity rates ranged from 41% (30 of 73 samples) in france to 74% (59 of 80 samples) in romania. with the exception of entamoeba histolytica and vibrio cholerae, all of the 22 targeted pathogens were  detected at least once. enteropathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter species, toxigenic clostridium difficile, enteroaggregative e. coli, norovirus and enterotoxigenic e. coli were the six most commonly detected pathogens. when tested according to local protocols, seven of 128 positive samples (5.5%) yielded multiple organisms. overall, the filmarray gi panel detected at least one organism in 54.2% (384/709) of the samples, as compared with 18.1% (128/709) when testing was performed with conventional techniques locally. this underlines the considerable potential of multiplex pcr to improve routine stool diagnostics in community-acquired diarrhoea. classic culture methods directed at the isolation of specific pathogens are increasingly becoming second-line tools, being deployed when rapid molecular tests give positive results. this optimizes the yield from stool examinations and dramatically improves the timeliness of diagnosis.

TI  == case-control comparison of bacterial and protozoan microorganisms associated with gastroenteritis: application of molecular detection.
AB  == the introduction of molecular detection of infectious organisms has led to increased numbers of positive findings, as observed for pathogens causing gastroenteritis (ge). however, because little is known about the prevalence of these pathogens in the healthy asymptomatic population, the clinical value of these additional findings is unclear. a case-control study was carried out in a population of patients served by general practitioners in the netherlands. a total of 2710 fecal samples from case and matched control subjects were subjected to multiplex real-time pcr for the 11 most common bacterial and four protozoal causes of ge. of 1515 case samples, 818 (54%) were positive for one or more target organisms. a total of 49% of the controls were positive. higher positivity rates in cases compared to controls were observed for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., clostridium difficile, enteroinvasive escherichia coli/shigella  spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, atypical enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, and giardia lamblia. however, dientamoeba fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli were detected significantly less frequent in cases than in controls, while no difference in prevalence was found for typical epec and enterohemorrhagic e. coli. the association between the presence of microorganisms and ge was the weakest in children aged 0 to 5 years. higher relative loads in cases further support causality. this was seen for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, and c. parvum/hominis, and for certain age categories of those infected with c. difficile, enteroaggregative e. coli, and atypical epec. for d. fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli/enterohemorrhagic e. coli, pathogen loads were lower in cases. application of molecular diagnostics in ge is rapid, sensitive and specific, but results should be interpreted with care, using clinical and additional background information.

TI  == multicenter evaluation of the biofire filmarray gastrointestinal panel for etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  == the appropriate treatment and control of infectious gastroenteritis depend on the ability to rapidly detect the wide range of etiologic agents associated with the  disease. clinical laboratories currently utilize an array of different methodologies to test for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of gastroenteritis, a strategy that suffers from poor sensitivity, potentially long  turnaround times, and complicated ordering practices and workflows. additionally, there are limited or no testing methods routinely available for most diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains, astroviruses, and sapoviruses. this study assessed the performance of the filmarray gastrointestinal (gi) panel for the simultaneous detection of 22 different enteric pathogens directly from stool specimens: campylobacter spp., clostridium difficile (toxin a/b), plesiomonas shigelloides, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, enteroaggregative e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, shiga-like toxin-producing e. coli (stx1 and stx2) (including specific detection of e. coli o157), shigella spp./enteroinvasive e. coli, cryptosporidium spp., cyclospora cayetanensis, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia, adenovirus f 40/41, astrovirus, norovirus gi/gii, rotavirus a, and sapovirus. prospectively collected stool specimens (n = 1,556) were evaluated using the biofire filmarray gi panel and tested with conventional stool culture and molecular methods for comparison. the filmarray gi panel sensitivity was 100% for 12/22 targets and >/=94.5% for an additional 7/22 targets. for the remaining  three targets, sensitivity could not be calculated due to the low prevalences in  this study. the filmarray gi panel specificity was >/=97.1% for all panel targets. the filmarray gi panel provides a comprehensive, rapid, and streamlined  alternative to conventional methods for the etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis in the laboratory setting. the potential advantages include improved performance parameters, a more extensive menu of pathogens, and a turnaround time of as short as 1 h.

TI  == comparison of maldi-tof ms, gene sequencing and the vitek 2 for identification of seventy-three clinical isolates of enteropathogens.
AB  == objective: this study was performed to evaluate the analytical and practical performance of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) compared to the sequencing method and the vitek  2 system for identi fi cation of enteropathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory. methods: ten type strains and 73 clinical isolates of enteropathogens representing eight genera were analyzed by maldi-tof ms. all isolates were also characterized by gene sequencing allowing interpretation of the results from maldi-tof ms. in addition, maldi-tof ms was compared with the vitek 2 system for  the identi fi cation of ten isolates of aeromonas and six of salmonella. results: as previously known, identification between shigella and escherichia coli is not  possible to distinguish. maldi-tof ms produced the correct identifications for all other type strains and clinical isolates to the genus level. fifteen campylobacter jejuni, six campylobacter coli, three plesiomonas shigelloides, three yersinia enterocolitica, two clostridium difficile, one vibrio parahaemolyticus, one vibrio fluvialis, and one vibrio cholera were all correctly identi fi ed to the species level. genus and species identifications of ten aeromonas and six salmonella isolates by maldi-tof ms were consistent with those  by the vitek 2, but with much less cost and about ten times faster. conclusions:  this study demonstrates that maldi-tof ms is a powerful tool for fast, accurate and low-cost identi fi cation of enteropathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == evaluation of a multiplex pcr assay for simultaneous detection of bacterial and viral enteropathogens in stool samples of paediatric patients.
AB  == we evaluated a multiplex pcr assay, the seeplex diarrhoea ace detection, that simultaneously detects 15 enteric pathogens, including salmonella spp., shigella  spp., vibrio spp., toxin b producer clostridium difficile, campylobacter spp., clostridium perfringens, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli, adenovirus, group a rotavirus, norovirus gi and gii, and astrovirus. we compared this assay with clinical methods routinely used in our laboratory, for detecting enteropathogens  in stool samples collected from 245 paediatric patients with suspected infectious gastroenteritis. we recovered 61 bacterial pathogens and 121 enteric viruses with our laboratory assays, while we detected 78 bacteria and 167 viruses with the molecular assay. we calculated specificity and sensitivity for both methods after analysis of discordant results and demonstrated greater sensitivity for multiplex pcr than for our routine methods, with the exception of salmonella spp. and toxigenic c. difficile detection. the multiplex pcr assay proved to be a reliable tool to directly detect the most common enteropathogens in stool samples but with some limitations.

TI  == emerging infectious colitis.
AB  == purpose of review: the present review will highlight recent advances in the knowledge of emerging pathogens causing infectious colitis and provide a description of the most important food-borne outbreaks. recent findings: outbreaks of enteric disease caused by salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) continue to surprise with new epidemiological findings or changing virulence characteristics. these pathogens evolve to exploit novel opportunities for spread and transmission, such as fresh  produce within the food chain, and generate new public health challenges. organic sprouts were recently considered as the source responsible for a large german disease outbreak comprising 3842 patients. the outbreak strain was identified as  an enteroaggregative stec o104:h4 (eaggc), a rare hybrid pathogen that harbours the phage encoded shiga toxin gene and antibiotic resistance in an eaggec background. clostridium difficile pcr ribotype 078 is emerging across europe, causing severe disease outside healthcare facilities as well as disease in farm animals, indicating that the species border has been crossed. although the global impact of cryptosporidiosis is less pronounced, these organisms have been responsible for large outbreaks of infectious diarrhoea, often not reported. invasive listeriosis is a serious food-borne illness and was found recently in 28 us states affecting 147 patients, associated with eating contaminated cantaloupe. outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by listeria monocytogenes are most likely severely underestimated. centralized surveillance of food-borne enteropathogens is essential for the early detection of disease outbreaks and for the organization of an immediate and appropriate response. summary: an improved understanding of the pathogenesis, pathology and epidemiology of emerging enteropathogens causing infectious colitis will provide new approaches for disease prevention and control.

TI  == added value of multiplex luminex gastrointestinal pathogen panel (xtag(r) gpp) testing in the diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  == the luminex gastrointestinal pathogen panel (xtag((r)) gpp) detects in one assay  the most common gastroenteritis-causing pathogens and toxins, namely adenovirus 40/41, norovirus genogroup (ng) i/ii, rotavirus a, clostridium difficile toxin a/b, campylobacter sp., escherichia coli o157, enterotoxigenic e. coli heat-labile enterotoxin/heat-stable enterotoxin, salmonella sp., shiga-toxin producing e. coli, shiga-like toxin (stx)1/2, shigella sp., vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium sp., entamoeba histolytica and giardia sp. in this study, we compared the results that were obtained by testing 393 faecal samples, collected during november and december 2011 at our laboratory, using the xtag((r)) gpp assay with the results of the routine diagnostic procedure. this procedure includes culture for bacteria and real-time pcr for viruses and parasites, but only if the test was requested by the clinician. if the clinician did not request the test for an xtag((r)) gpp-positive target, real-time pcr assays were used to confirm xtag((r)) gpp positivity. discrepant results were also tested with real-time pcr assays. a total of 83 targets were detected in 76 samples using xtag((r)) gpp. the xtag((r)) gpp assay detected 43 additional positives compared with the routine diagnostic procedure, of which 11  targets could not be confirmed by real-time pcr. the non-confirmed targets were campylobacter (one sample), salmonella (four samples), shigella (one sample) and  e. histolytica (five samples). the xtag((r)) gpp was shown to be a convenient and sensitive assay for detection of 15 major gastrointestinal pathogens in a single  molecular test, but for detection of e. histolytica and salmonella, a confirmatory assay is indicated.

TI  == [drug therapy of infectious diarrhea: part 1: acute diarrhea].
AB  == background: diarrhea is one of the most commonly occurring diseases. aim: this article gives a review of the current state of the treatment of acute infectious  diarrhea (part 1) and chronic infectious diarrhea (part 2) as well as of the most important pathogens. material and methods: following a presentation of the general principles of the therapy of diarrhea, the targeted antimicrobial therapy of the most important bacterial gastrointestinal infections is described. this includes salmonellosis, shigellosis and campylobacter infections, infections with pathogenic escherichia coli strains, yersiniosis and cholera. due to the increasing incidence and changes in the severity of the disease and important new aspects in the treatment of diarrhea caused by toxigenic clostridium difficile strains, these disease entities will be described in detail. results: symptomatic therapy is still the most important aspect of the treatment of infectious diarrhea. for severely ill patients with a high frequency of stools (> 8/day), immunodeficiency, advanced age or significant comorbidities, empirical antibiotic therapy should be considered. increasing resistance, in particular against fluoroquinolones must also be taken into consideration. due to the risk of excessive pathogen proliferation and concomitant intestinal toxin production with protracted or multiple complications during the disease, therapy with motility inhibitors is not recommended. with respect to the treatment of clostridium difficile infections a promising novel aspect arose in 2012. the macrocyclic antibiotic fidaxomycin can reduce the rate of recurrent disease with the same effectiveness as vancomycin. furthermore, evidence for the benefits of allogenic  stool transplantation is increasing. conclusion: the treatment of acute diarrhea  is still primarily supportive. the benefits of general empirical antibiotic therapy for acute diarrhea are not evidence-based.

TI  == evaluation of luminex xtag gastrointestinal pathogen analyte-specific reagents for high-throughput, simultaneous detection of bacteria, viruses, and parasites of clinical and public health importance.
AB  == acute diarrheal disease (add) can be caused by a range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. conventional diagnostic methods, such as culture, microscopy, biochemical assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa), are laborious and time-consuming and lack sensitivity. combined, the array of tests performed on a single specimen can increase the turnaround time (tat) significantly. we validated a 19plex laboratory-developed gastrointestinal  pathogen panel (gpp) using luminex xtag analyte-specific reagents (asrs) to simultaneously screen directly in fecal specimens for diarrhea-causing pathogens, including bacteria (campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., shigella spp., enterotoxigenic escherichia coli [etec], shiga toxin-producing e. coli [stec], e. coli o157:h7, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, and toxigenic clostridium difficile), parasites (giardia lamblia, cryptosporidium spp., and entamoeba histolytica), and viruses (norovirus gi and gii, adenovirus 40/41, and rotavirus  a). performance characteristics of gpp asrs were determined using 48 reference isolates and 254 clinical specimens. stool specimens from individuals with diarrhea were tested for pathogens using conventional and molecular methods. using the predictive methods as standards, the sensitivities of the gpp asrs were 100% for adenovirus 40/41, norovirus, rotavirus a, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, entamoeba histolytica, cryptosporidium spp., and e. coli o157:h7; 95% for giardia lamblia; 94% for etec and stec; 93% for shigella spp.; 92% for salmonella spp.; 91% for c. difficile a/b toxins; and 90% for campylobacter jejuni. the overall comparative performance of the gpp asrs with conventional methods in clinical samples was 94.5% (range, 90% to 97%), with 99% (99.0% to 99.9%) specificity. implementation of the gpp asrs enables our public health laboratory to offer highly sensitive and specific screening and identification of the major add-causing pathogens.

TI  == systematic application of multiplex pcr enhances the detection of bacteria, parasites, and viruses in stool samples.
AB  == objectives: to determine whether systematic testing of faecal samples with a broad range multiplex pcr increases the diagnostic yield in patients with diarrhoea compared with conventional methods and a clinician initiated testing strategy. methods: 1758 faecal samples from 1516 patients with diarrhoea submitted to two diagnostic laboratories were tested for viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens by fast-track diagnostics multiplex real-time pcr kits and conventional diagnostic tests. results: multiplex pcr detected pathogens in 530 samples (30%): adenovirus (51, 3%), astrovirus (95, 5%), norovirus (172, 10%), rotavirus (3, 0.2%), campylobacter jejuni/coli (85, 5%), salmonella spp. (22, 1%), clostridium difficile (72, 4%), entero-haemorrhagic escherichia coli (21, 1%), cryptosporidium spp. (3, 0.2%), entamoeba histolytica (1, 0.1%), and giardia lamblia (59, 3%). in contrast, conventional testing detected a pathogen in 324 (18%) samples. conclusions: using a systematic approach to the diagnosis of gastroenteritis improved diagnostic yield. this enhanced detection with pcr was achieved by a combination of improved detection of individual pathogens and detection of pathogens not requested or unable to be tested by conventional tests. this approach also allowed earlier identification for most pathogens and created a workflow which is likely to adapt well for many diagnostic laboratories.

TI  == a culture-independent sequence-based metagenomics approach to the investigation of an outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4.
AB  == importance: identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. however, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. objective: to explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of dna extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. design, setting, and patients: in a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were  selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli (stec) o104:h4 in germany. samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (august-september 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (november 2012-february 2013). in phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. in phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. in phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak  strain. main outcomes and measures: the recovery of genome sequence data for the  purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other  pathogens from fecal samples. results: during phase 1, a draft genome of the stec outbreak strain was obtained. during phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. sequences from the shiga-toxin genes were detected  in 27 of 40 stec-positive samples (67%). in phase 3, sequences from clostridium difficile, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter concisus, and salmonella enterica  were recovered. conclusions and relevance: these results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.

TI  == coinfection in acute gastroenteritis predicts a more severe clinical course in children.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of enteric pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis (age) among hospitalized children in a large italian hospital, to measure the incidence of coinfections, and to compare the clinical characteristics of those infected with one versus multiple agents. a prospective study was conducted from march 2010 to april 2011 at the bambino gesu pediatric hospital in rome, italy. all patients between 1 month and 16 years of age admitted to the pediatric department with a diagnosis of age were eligible for enrollment. two stool samples for each patient were tested for gastrointestinal pathogens. we summarized the clinical severity of episodes, describing the duration of diarrhea, duration and frequency of vomiting, fever, and severity of dehydration. all the patients underwent medical evaluation with estimation of dehydration. one or more etiological agents were detected in 151 out of 232 patients (65.1%), while we did not detect any etiological agent in 81  (34.9%). rotavirus was detected in 96 (63.6%), adenovirus in 17 (11.2%), norovirus in 7 (4.6%), toxin-producing clostridium difficile in 23 (15.2%), salmonella spp. in 15 (9.9%, b group in 12/15 and d group in 3/15), c. perfringens in 12 (7.9%), campylobacter spp. in 6 (4%), and verotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec) in 2 (1.3%). in 27 children out of 151 (17.9%), we found  evidence of coinfection. coinfection with rotavirus and toxin-producing c. difficile was the most common (63%). children with coinfection had a more severe  clinical presentation and had a higher probability to be severely dehydrated, independently of age and living community type.

TI  == a laboratory-developed taqman array card for simultaneous detection of 19 enteropathogens.
AB  == the taqman array card (tac) system is a 384-well singleplex real-time pcr format  that has been used to detect multiple infection targets. here we developed an enteric taqman array card to detect 19 enteropathogens, including viruses (adenovirus, astrovirus, norovirus gii, rotavirus, and sapovirus), bacteria (campylobacter jejuni/c. coli, clostridium difficile, salmonella, vibrio cholerae, diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains including enteroaggregative e. coli [eaec], enterotoxigenic e. coli [etec], enteropathogenic e. coli [epec], and shiga-toxigenic e. coli [stec]), shigella/enteroinvasive e. coli (eiec), protozoa (cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, and entamoeba histolytica), and helminths (ascaris lumbricoides and trichuris trichiura), as well as two extrinsic controls to monitor extraction and amplification efficiency (the bacteriophage ms2 and phocine herpesvirus). primers and probes were newly designed or adapted from published sources and spotted onto microfluidic cards. fecal samples were spiked  with extrinsic controls, and dna and rna were extracted using the qiaamp stool dna minikit and the quickgene rna tissue kit, respectively, and then mixed with ag-path-id one step real-time reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) reagents and loaded into cards. pcr efficiencies were between 90% and 105%, with linearities of 0.988 to 1. the limit of detection of the assays in the tac was within a 10-fold difference from the cognate assays performed on plates. precision testing demonstrated a coefficient of variation of below 5% within a run and 14% between  runs. accuracy was evaluated for 109 selected clinical specimens and revealed an  average sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 77%, respectively, compared with conventional methods (including microscopy, culture, and immunoassay) and 98% and 96%, respectively, compared with our laboratory-developed pcr-luminex assays. this tac allows fast, accurate, and quantitative detection of a broad spectrum of enteropathogens and is well suited for surveillance or clinical purposes.

AB  == background: the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) has dramatically reduced the prevalence of opportunistic infections, however data on the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in hiv-infected patients with low cd4 cell counts in the cart era are scarce. methods: we performed a prospective cohort study among hiv-infected patients with cd4 cell counts <100/mm(3) seen at  a university hospital in paris. medical records were reviewed and stool samples were obtained for macroscopic examination and detection of parasites including cryptosporidia and microsporidia, whether or not the patient had diarrhea. stool  cultures were performed for patients with diarrhea. factors associated with the detection of parasites were then identified. results: stools samples from 143 consecutive patients were analyzed. patients were mostly men (76%), and the median patient age was 41 years. the median cd4 cell count was 32/mm(3), and 59%  were receiving cart. diarrhea was present in 85 patients (59%), 19 of whom (22%)  had intestinal parasites detected in stools. three patients with diarrhea were diagnosed with salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter coli, and clostridium difficile infections. among the 58 patients without diarrhea, parasitic intestinal pathogens were still identified in six (10%). the overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 17%, with cryptosporidia (n=8), microsporidia (n=6),  and giardia duodenalis (n=5) being the most frequent pathogens. patients with intestinal parasites had diarrhea more often (76% vs. 56%, p=0.025) and were more often at us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) clinical stage c (84% vs. 69%, p=0.024) than patients without parasites. conclusions: the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections remains significant in hiv-infected patients with low cd4 counts in the cart era. a systematic search for parasitic pathogens including microsporidia, cryptosporidia, and g. duodenalis should be performed even in the absence of diarrhea.

TI  == diarrhea etiology in a pediatric emergency department: a case control study.
AB  == background: the etiology of childhood diarrhea is frequently unknown. methods: we sought aeromonas, campylobacter, escherichia coli o157:h7, pleisiomonas shigelloides, salmonella, shigella, vibrio, and yersinia (by culture), adenoviruses, astroviruses, noroviruses, rotavirus, and shiga toxin-producing e.  coli (stec; by enzyme immunoassay), clostridium difficile (by cytotoxicity), parasites (by microscopy), and enteroaggregative e. coli (eaec; by polymerase chain reaction [pcr] analysis) in the stools of 254 children with diarrhea presenting to a pediatric emergency facility. age- and geographic-matched community controls without diarrhea (n = 452) were similarly studied, except bacterial cultures of the stool were limited only to cases. results: twenty-nine  (11.4%) case stools contained 13 salmonella, 10 stec (6 o157:h7 and 4 non-o157:h7 serotypes), 5 campylobacter, and 2 shigella. pcr-defined eaec were present more often in case (3.2%) specimens than in control (0.9%) specimens (adjusted odds ratio [or], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.1-13.7), and their adherence phenotypes were variable. rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus were more common  among cases than controls, but both groups contained noroviruses and c. difficile at similar rates. pcr evidence of hypervirulent c. difficile was found in case and control stools; parasites were much more common in control specimens. conclusions: eaec are associated with childhood diarrhea in seattle, but the optimal way to identify these agents warrants determination. children without diarrhea harbor diarrheagenic pathogens, including hypervirulent c. difficile. our data support the importance of taking into account host susceptibility, microbial density, and organism virulence traits in future case-control studies,  not merely categorizing candidate pathogens as being present or absent.

TI  == high incidence of campylobacter concisus in gastroenteritis in north jutland, denmark: a population-based study.
AB  == the incidence of non-thermophilic campylobacter species was assessed in an unselected population-based study in a mixed urban and rural community in north jutland, denmark. in a 2-year study period, 11,314 faecal samples from 8302 patients with gastroenteritis were cultured with supplement of the filter method. we recovered a high incidence of campylobacter concisus (annual incidence 35/100,000 inhabitants), almost as high as the common campylobacter jejuni/coli.  in contrast, there was a very low incidence of other non-thermophilic campylobacter species, such as campylobacter upsaliensis. campylobacter concisus  was, unlike c. jejuni/coli, found more frequently among small children (<1 year)  and the elderly (>/= 65 years). around 10% of the patients with c. consisus had co-infections dominated by clostridium difficile and salmonella enterica, whereas co-infections occurred in about 5% of c. jejuni/coli patients. we observed a seasonal variation in c. jejuni/coli with a peak incidence in late summer months  and autumn, whereas there was an almost constant monthly prevalence of c. concisus. among patients participating in a questionnaire sub-study, there was a  higher degree of close contacts with animals, especially dogs, as well as a higher travel exposure among c. jejuni/coli patients compared with c. concisus patients. we did not culture any c. concisus in stool samples from a small cohort of healthy individuals. future studies have to focus on the clinical follow-up and the long-term risk of inflammatory bowel diseases in c. concisus-positive patients. we conclude that there is a high incidence of c. concisus in denmark.

TI  == the patient presenting with acute dysentery--a systematic review.
AB  == objectives: the etiologies, clinical presentations and diagnosis of acute pathogen-specific dysentery in children and adults in industrialized and developing regions is described to help develop recommendations for therapy. methods: we conducted a systematic review of literature published between january 2000 and june 2011 to determine the frequency of occurrence of pathogen-specific  dysentery. results: shigella, salmonella, and campylobacter remain the most frequent bacterial causes of dysentery worldwide. shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) is potentially important in industrialized countries. entamoeba histolytica must be considered in the developing world, particularly in rural or periurban areas. clinicians should use epidemiological clues and knowledge of endemicity to suspect vibrio spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium difficile, cytomegalovirus or schistosoma mansoni in cases presenting with dysentery. a single fecal sample studied for etiologic agents is the customary way to make an etiologic diagnosis. conclusions: while a majority of dysenteric cases will not have an identifiable agent causing the illness, when an etiologic organism is identified, other than stec, each has a specific recommended form of therapy, which is provided in this  review.

TI  == enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats: diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control.
AB  == this report offers a consensus opinion on the diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control of the primary enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats, with an emphasis on clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., and escherichia coli associated with granulomatous colitis in boxers. veterinarians are challenged when attempting to diagnose animals with suspected bacterial-associated diarrhea because well-scrutinized practice guidelines that provide objective recommendations for implementing fecal testing  are lacking. this problem is compounded by similar isolation rates for putative bacterial enteropathogens in animals with and without diarrhea, and by the lack of consensus among veterinary diagnostic laboratories as to which diagnostic assays should be utilized. most bacterial enteropathogens are associated with self-limiting diarrhea, and injudicious administration of antimicrobials could be more harmful than beneficial. salmonella and campylobacter are well-documented zoonoses, but antimicrobial administration is not routinely advocated in uncomplicated cases and supportive therapy is recommended. basic practices of isolation, use of appropriate protective equipment, and proper cleaning and disinfection are the mainstays of control. handwashing with soap and water is preferred over use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers because spores of c. difficile and c. perfringens are alcohol-resistant, but susceptible to bleach (1:10 to 1:20 dilution of regular household bleach) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide. the implementation of practice guidelines in combination with the integration of validated molecular-based testing and conventional testing is pivotal if we are to optimize the identification and management of enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats.

TI  == approach to the patient with infectious colitis.
AB  == purpose of review: to provide current recommendations for evaluation and treatment of patients with infectious colitis. infectious colitis is diagnosed in someone with diarrhea and one or more of the following: fever and/or dysentery, stools containing inflammatory markers such as leukocytes, lactoferrin, or calprotectin, or positive stool culture for an invasive or inflammatory bacterial enteropathogen including shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) or clostridium difficile, or colonic inflammation by endoscopy. recent findings: standard stool culture should be performed in patients with infectious colitis. epidemiologic findings including prior international travel, shellfish-associated diarrhea, living in parasite-endemic regions may suggest the need for specialized studies of etiology. when stec is suspected as a pathogen because only low grade or no fever is seen in a patient with acute dysentery, a competent laboratory should look for e. coli o157:h7 and shiga toxin directly in stool. summary: once laboratory diagnosis is made, pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy should be initiated for all forms of infectious colitis other than stec. for empiric treatment of febrile dysenteric diarrhea invasive bacterial enteropathogens (shigella, salmonella, and campylobacter) should be suspected and adults may be treated empirically with 1000mg azithromycin in a single dose.

TI  == gastrointestinal infection as a trigger for inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == purpose of review: there is accumulating evidence on the importance of microbes in the development and maintenance of both the intestinal and immune systems. this review focuses on the current findings on the role of gastrointestinal pathogens in the cause of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. recent findings: a  number of intestinal pathogens including mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive escherichia coli, and campylobacter species are associated at fairly high prevalence with crohn's disease, while two recent studies found a low prevalence for cytomegalovirus. in a prospective study, m. avium subspecies paratuberculosis detection in early crohn's disease was low and  comparable to controls, while much higher in an established inflammatory bowel disease cohort. in the pediatric setting, a high prevalence of clostridium difficile was seen in both active and inactive crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. some studies have speculated that salmonella or campylobacter infection may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease on long-term follow-up, but detection bias was found to obscure the risk. recent studies in mouse models have demonstrated that a combination of factors, including viral pathogens, genetic susceptibility, and commensal microflora, can lead to intestinal pathology. summary: no evidence for causation of inflammatory bowel disease by a single agent has been found, whereas a number of microbes have been  strongly associated with the presence of disease. the majority of recent studies  support a role for the ability of intestinal pathogens to promote chronic inflammation in individuals with genetic susceptibility and/or other environmental factors which remain to be identified. these factors may include subsets of commensal microflora.

TI  == toxic megacolon.
AB  == toxic megacolon represents a dreaded complication of mainly inflammatory or infectious conditions of the colon. it is most commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), i.e., ulcerative colitis or ileocolonic crohn's disease. lately, the epidemiology has shifted toward infectious causes, specifically due to an increase of clostridium difficile-associated colitis possibly due to the extensive (ab)use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. other important infectious etiologies include salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, cytomegalovirus (cmv), rotavirus, aspergillus, and entameba. less frequently, toxic megacolon has been attributed to ischemic colitis, collagenous colitis, or  obstructive colorectal cancer. toxic colonic dilatation may also occur in hemolytic-uremic syndrome (hus) caused by enterohemorrhagic or enteroaggregative  escherichia coli o157 (ehec, eaec, or eahec). the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to toxic colonic dilatation are incompletely understood. the main characteristics of toxic megacolon are signs of systemic toxicity and severe colonic distension. diagnosis is made by clinical evaluation for systemic toxicity and imaging studies depicting colonic dilatation. plain abdominal imaging is still the most established radiological instrument. however, computed  tomography scanning and transabdominal intestinal ultrasound are promising alternatives that add additional information. management of toxic megacolon is an interdisciplinary task that requires close interaction of gastroenterologists and surgeons from the very beginning. the optimal timing of surgery for toxic megacolon can be challenging. here we review the latest data on the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory, and imaging modalities and provide algorithms  for an evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

TI  == systematic review: the use of proton pump inhibitors and increased susceptibility to enteric infection.
AB  == background: the use of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) is increasing worldwide. suppression of gastric acid alters the susceptibility to enteric bacterial pathogens. aim this systematic review was undertaken to examine the relationship  between ppi use and susceptibility to enteric infections by a specific pathogen based on published literature and to discuss the potential mechanisms of ppi enhanced pathogenesis of enteric infections. methods pubmed, ovid medline databases were searched. search terms included proton pump inhibitors and mechanisms of, actions of, gastric acid, enteric infections, diarrhoea, clostridium difficile, salmonella, shigella and campylobacter. results the use of ppis increases gastric ph, encourages growth of the gut microflora, increases bacterial translocation and alters various immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. enteric pathogens show variable gastric acid ph susceptibility and acid  tolerance levels. by multiple mechanisms, ppis appear to increase susceptibility  to the following bacterial enteropathogens: salmonella, campylobacter jejuni, invasive strains of escherichia coli, vegetative cells of clostridium difficile,  vibrio cholerae and listeria. we describe the available evidence for enhanced susceptibility to enteric infection caused by salmonella, campylobacter and c. difficile by ppi use, with adjusted relative risk ranges of 4.2-8.3 (two studies); 3.5-11.7 (four studies); and 1.2-5.0 (17 of 27 studies) for the three respective organisms. conclusions severe hypochlorhydria generated by ppi use leads to bacterial colonisation and increased susceptibility to enteric bacterial infection. the clinical implication of chronic ppi use among hospitalized patients placed on antibiotics and travellers departing for areas with high incidence of diarrhoea should be considered by their physicians.

TI  == bacteria as trigger for chronic gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == apart from acute infections, microorganisms may also induce or perpetuate chronic inflammatory diseases and reversible or irreversible proliferation of various cells in the gastrointestinal tract (the extreme being adenocarcinoma and lymphoma). helicobacter pylori is not only involved in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma. the steps and mechanisms of the carcinogenic process involve host predisposition, environmental factors, and strain virulence. the steps of lymphoma genesis include chronic inflammation, acquisition of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the stomach, proliferation of the b lymphocytes in an inflammatory context, acquisition of genetic anomalies and dysregulation of the nf-kappab pathway. the role of campylobacter jejuni in immunoproliferative small bowel disease has also been shown and eradication of this bacterium can cure the lymphoma at its early stage. the evidence for the role of some bacteria in colon cancer development is discussed. opportunistic pathogens are detected in the stools or mucosa of a proportion of subjects with crohn's disease. they include mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, adherent invasive escherichia coli, and clostridium difficile. a dysbiosis has been repeatedly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. instability of the dominant microbiota and decreased biodiversity (especially in the firmicutes  phylum) are major characteristics. the decrease of faecalibacterium prausnitzii seems to have a prognostic value to predict relapse of crohn's disease after surgery. finally, important perspectives are opened by new tools such as metagenomics and metabolomics of the gastrointestinal ecosystems. major tracks concern irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer and obesity.

AB  == in this study, 5 different commercial dna extraction systems were tested on a stool sample collection containing 81 clinical stool specimens that were culture-positive for diarrheagenic escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, or clostridium difficile. the purified dnas were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) directed toward the relevant organisms. the results showed that conventional pcr combined with the extraction systems biorobot ez1 (qiagen, hilden, germany), bugs'n beads (genpoint, oslo, norway), chargeswitch (invitrogen, paisley, uk), qiaamp stool mini kit (qiagen), and 2 protocols (generic and specific a) for easymag (biomerieux, marcy i'etoile, france) were able to identify 89%, 62%, 85%, 88%, 85%, and 91%, respectively, of  the pathogens originally identified by conventional culture-based methods. when taqman pcr was combined with the easymag specific a protocol, 99% of the samples  were correctly identified. the results demonstrate that the extraction efficiencies can vary significantly among different extraction systems, careful optimization may have a significant positive effect, and the use of sensitive and specific detection methods like taqman pcr is an ideal choice for this type of analysis.

AB  == rifamycin sv is a broad-spectrum, poorly absorbed antimicrobial agent that, when  coupled with mmx technology, is being targeted for the oral treatment of traveler's diarrhea (td) and clostridium difficile-associated disease (cdad). rifamycin sv was tested for activity against 911 td-associated enteropathogens and 30 c. difficile isolates collected from several global surveillance studies.  rifamycin sv demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity levels against the enterobacteriaceae, with mic(5)(0) values ranging from 32 to 128 mug/ml for all but one strain (an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli at >512 mug/ml). for non-enterobacteriaceae strains, mic(5)(0) values ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml, with  the exception of campylobacter spp., for which all strains had mic values of >512 mug/ml. rifamycin sv also demonstrated excellent activity (mic(5)(0) of </= 0.03  mug/ml) against most c. difficile strains (including one hypervirulent nap1 strain), and this activity was even superior to the potency observed for vancomycin, metronidazole, and rifaximin. in mutational passaging studies, rifamycin sv induced stable resistance and showed a mutation frequency in e. coli similar to that of rifampin. this study presents the potency of rifamycin sv for  enteropathogens commonly recovered from patients with td and cdad. additional in  vitro and in vivo studies appear necessary to determine the utility of rifamycin  sv as an oral agent for the prevention and treatment of td and cdad.

TI  == carriage of clostridium difficile and other enteric pathogens among a 4-h avocational cohort.
AB  == clostridium difficile (cd), salmonella, campylobacter and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) are major causes of morbidity in a variety of enteric diseases in humans and animals, but subclinical carriage in both is probably more common than are clinical cases. little is known regarding the prevalence of these pathogens in animals raised for exhibit at michigan county fairs or the frequency with which michigan citizens raising these animals may have been subclinically colonized. to address these issues, 361 fecal specimens from 158 humans and 203 of their farm animals were cultured for cd, salmonella and campylobacter. additionally, 50 people and their cattle were tested for ehec. no ehec, salmonella or campylobacter were detected. however, 16 specimens (4.4%) were positive for cd: 13 humans, two horses and one pig. none of the farm animal specimens submitted by any of the 13 cd-positive humans were positive for cd. strain characterization [toxinotype, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge)] demonstrated that the human cd isolates were similar to what has been reported previously in the general us population. we conclude that horses and farm animals (cattle, sheep, goats and swine) at 1-2 months before market weight showed no evidence of wide-spread carriage of the common enteric pathogens, including the recently reported cd toxinotype v. these results provide no support to the hypothesis that 4-h members or others visiting county fair animal husbandry projects in these counties may be at increased risk for acquisition of cd, salmonella, campylobacter or ehec from animals.

TI  == development of a dna microarray to detect antimicrobial resistance genes identified in the national center for biotechnology information database.
AB  == to understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (ar), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. to achieve this, ar genes in the national center for biotechnology information genbank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. a dna microarray was constructed of 70mer  oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. the microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of salmonella enterica: typhimurium lt2 (sensitive) and typhi ct18 (multidrug resistance [mdr]). all resistance genes encoded on the mdr  plasmid, phcm1, harbored by ct18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in lt2. the microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including mdr salmonella enterica serovars, escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, listeria spp., and clostridium difficile. the results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all ar genes found in the national center for biotechnology information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.

TI  == enteric bacterial pathogen detection in southern sea otters (enhydra lutris nereis) is associated with coastal urbanization and freshwater runoff.
AB  == although protected for nearly a century, california's sea otters have been slow to recover, in part due to exposure to fecally-associated protozoal pathogens like toxoplasma gondii and sarcocystis neurona. however, potential impacts from exposure to fecal bacteria have not been systematically explored. using selective media, we examined feces from live and dead sea otters from california for specific enteric bacterial pathogens (campylobacter, salmonella, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile and escherichia coli o157:h7), and pathogens endemic to the marine environment (vibrio cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus and plesiomonas shigelloides). we evaluated statistical associations between detection of these pathogens in otter feces and demographic or environmental risk factors for otter  exposure, and found that dead otters were more likely to test positive for c. perfringens, campylobacter and v. parahaemolyticus than were live otters. otters  from more urbanized coastlines and areas with high freshwater runoff (near outflows of rivers or streams) were more likely to test positive for one or more  of these bacterial pathogens. other risk factors for bacterial detection in otters included male gender and fecal samples collected during the rainy season when surface runoff is maximal. similar risk factors were reported in prior studies of pathogen exposure for california otters and their invertebrate prey, suggesting that land-sea transfer and/or facilitation of pathogen survival in degraded coastal marine habitat may be impacting sea otter recovery. because otters and humans share many of the same foods, our findings may also have implications for human health.

TI  == mucin dynamics in intestinal bacterial infection.
AB  == background: bacterial gastroenteritis causes morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. murine citrobacter rodentium infection is a model for gastroenteritis  caused by the human pathogens enteropathogenic escherichia coli and enterohaemorrhagic e. coli. mucin glycoproteins are the main component of the first barrier that bacteria encounter in the intestinal tract. methodology/principal findings: using immunohistochemistry, we investigated intestinal expression of mucins (alcian blue/pas, muc1, muc2, muc4, muc5ac, muc13 and muc3/17) in healthy and c. rodentium infected mice. the majority of the c. rodentium infected mice developed systemic infection and colitis in the mid and distal colon by day 12. c. rodentium bound to the major secreted mucin, muc2, in  vitro, and high numbers of bacteria were found in secreted muc2 in infected animals in vivo, indicating that mucins may limit bacterial access to the epithelial surface. in the small intestine, caecum and proximal colon, the mucin  expression was similar in infected and non-infected animals. in the distal colonic epithelium, all secreted and cell surface mucins decreased with the exception of the muc1 cell surface mucin which increased after infection (p<0.05). similarly, during human infection salmonella st paul, campylobacter jejuni and clostridium difficile induced muc1 in the colon. conclusion: major changes in both the cell-surface and secreted mucins occur in response to intestinal infection.

TI  == mechanisms of infectious diarrhea.
AB  == infectious diarrhea is an important public health problem worldwide. research has provided new insights into the mechanisms of diarrhea caused by various pathogens that are classified as noninflammatory, inflammatory or invasive. these three groups of organisms cause two diarrheal syndromes--noninflammatory diarrhea and inflammatory diarrhea. the noninflammatory diarrheas are caused by enterotoxin-producing organisms such as vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, or by viruses that adhere to the mucosa and disrupt the absorptive and/or secretory processes of the enterocyte without causing acute inflammation or mucosal destruction. inflammatory diarrhea is caused by two groups of organisms--cytotoxin-producing, noninvasive bacteria (e.g. enteroaggregative escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli and clostridium difficile), or by invasive organisms (e.g. salmonella spp., shigella  spp., campylobacter spp., entamoeba histolytica). the cytotoxin-producing organisms adhere to the mucosa, activate cytokines and stimulate the intestinal mucosa to release inflammatory mediators. invasive organisms, which can also produce cytotoxins, invade the intestinal mucosa to induce an acute inflammatory  reaction, involving the activation of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. regardless of the underlying mechanism they use, these various types of pathogen  have all successfully evolved to evade and modulate the host defense systems. the mechanisms by which the different pathogens invade the host and cause infectious  diarrhea are the topic of this review.

TI  == [infectious aetiologies of travelers' diarrhoea].
AB  == traveler's diarrhoea (td) occurs in 20 to 60% of european or north-american travelers in intertropical areas. following return from endemic zone, malaria must always be evocated in front of febrile diarrhoea. many causative infectious  agents are involved in td and their frequency may vary according to destination and seasons. the main agents involved in td are escherichia coli pathovars (especially enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative e. coli) followed by enteroinvasive bacteria (campylobacter spp., shigella spp., salmonella enterica), enteric viruses (norovirus, rotavirus) and protozoa (gardia intestinalis, cryptosporidium parvum et entamoeba histolytica). the development of molecular biology methods as pcr may allow us to evaluate the relative frequency of these agents and especially of viral agents in td. protozoa and microsporidia are more  frequently isolated in persistent and chronic td, especially in compromised patients. a complete etiological research in routine microbiology laboratories is difficult and time-consuming, related to the high diversity of causative agents and the need for specific methods. implementation of laboratory diagnosis is highly recommended when diarrhoea is associated with fever or presence of blood in stools, immunosuppression, antibiotic treatment (clostridium difficile toxins) or in case of persistent/chronic diarrhoea. according to the high frequency of acquired antibiotic-resistance in enteric bacteria, an antibiogram must be performed for all causative bacterial agents.

TI  == antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide inhibits the pyruvate oxidoreductases of helicobacter pylori, selected anaerobic bacteria and parasites, and campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == nitazoxanide (ntz) exhibits broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic bacteria and parasites and the ulcer-causing pathogen helicobacter pylori. here we show that ntz is a noncompetitive inhibitor (k(i), 2 to 10 microm) of the pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductases (pfors) of trichomonas vaginalis,  entamoeba histolytica, giardia intestinalis, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, h. pylori, and campylobacter jejuni and is weakly active against the pyruvate dehydrogenase of escherichia coli. to further mechanistic studies, the pfor operon of h. pylori was cloned and overexpressed in e. coli, and the multisubunit complex was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. pyruvate-dependent pfor activity with ntz, as measured by a decrease in absorbance at 418 nm (spectral shift from 418 to 351 nm), unlike the reduction of viologen dyes, did not result in the accumulation of products (acetyl coenzyme a  and co(2)) and pyruvate was not consumed in the reaction. ntz did not displace the thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp) cofactor of pfor, and the 351-nm absorbing form  of ntz was inactive. optical scans and (1)h nuclear magnetic resonance analyses determined that the spectral shift (a(418) to a(351)) of ntz was due to protonation of the anion (ntz(-)) of the 2-amino group of the thiazole ring which could be generated with the pure compound under acidic solutions (pk(a) = 6.18).  we propose that ntz(-) intercepts pfor at an early step in the formation of the lactyl-tpp transition intermediate, resulting in the reversal of pyruvate binding prior to decarboxylation and in coordination with proton transfer to ntz. thus, ntz might be the first example of an antimicrobial that targets the "activated cofactor" of an enzymatic reaction rather than its substrate or catalytic sites,  a novel mechanism that may escape mutation-based drug resistance.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of diarrhoea in young children: high prevalence of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) not belonging to the classical epec serogroups.
AB  == diarrhoeal disease continues to be one of the most common causes of admittance in children hospital emergency. the aim of the present study was to investigate the  relative contribution of enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli  (epec and ehec, respectively) as a cause of infectious bacterial diarrhoea in children from the region of toulouse. we analysed 280 samples of stools from 280  children (<2 years) with diarrhoea admitted in the "hopital des enfants" from january to august 2005. classic pathogens (salmonella, campylobacter, yersinia, shigella, aeromonas and vibrio) were detected by standard culture methods. enterotoxigenic clostridium difficile were identified after culture by immuno-enzyme assay (iea). virulence genes of epec and ehec were detected by using pcr. shiga-toxin production of ehec strains was confirmed with an iea test. potential enteric pathogens were identified in 55 patients. epec was the most frequently identified agent (30 patients), followed by campylobacter (9 cases: 7  c. jejuni and 2 c. coli) and c. difficile (8 patients), then ehec (5 patients) and salmonella (3 patients). no shigella, yersinia, aeromonas or other pathogenic bacteria were detected during this period in that class of children. epec not belonging to the classical epec serogroups were highly prevalent (24 versus 6). ehec possessed different genotypes and serogroups: o26 (2 strains), o157 (2 strains) and one un-typable strain. this study demonstrates the importance of epec (55 % of positive cases) and of ehec (more frequent than salmonella) in the  aetiology of diarrhoeal diseases of young children. we confirm the usefulness of  the pcr methodology: it allows the detection of virulent e. coli and thus increases by two fold the diagnosis of bacterial diarrhoea.

TI  == diarrhea etiology in a children's hospital emergency department: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == background: we evaluated the frequency of recovery of pathogens from children with diarrhea who presented to a pediatric emergency department and characterized the associated illnesses, to develop guidelines for performing a bacterial enteric culture. methods: we conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients with diarrhea who presented to a large regional pediatric emergency department during the period from november 1998 through october 2001. a thorough microbiologic evaluation was performed on stool specimens, and the findings were  correlated with case, physician, and laboratory data. results: a total of 1626 stool specimens were studied to detect diarrheagenic bacteria and, if there was a sufficient amount of stool, clostridium difficile toxin (688 specimens), parasites (656 specimens), and viruses (417 specimens). one hundred seventy-six (47%) of 372 specimens that underwent complete testing yielded a bacterial pathogen (shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, 39 specimens [of which 28 were  serotype o157:h7]; salmonella species, 39; campylobacter species, 25; shigella species, 14; and yersinia enterocolitica, 2), a viral pathogen (rotavirus, 85 specimens; astrovirus, 27; adenovirus, 18; or rotavirus and astrovirus, 8), a diarrheagenic parasite (5 specimens); or c. difficile toxin (46 specimens). samples from 2 patients yielded both bacterial and viral pathogens. a model to identify predictors of bacterial infection found that international travel, fever, and the passing of >10 stools in the prior 24 h were associated with the presence of a bacterial pathogen. physician judgment regarding the need to perform a stool culture was almost as accurate as the model in predicting bacterial pathogens. conclusions: nearly one-half of the patients who presented to the emergency department with diarrhea had a definite or plausible pathogen in their stool specimens. we were unable to develop a model that was substantially better than physician judgment in identifying patients for whom bacterial culture would yield positive results. the unexpectedly high rate of c. difficile toxin warrants further examination.

TI  == prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  == visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. this cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents  in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across ontario. between may and july 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. one specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. all dogs were judged to be in good health. zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. the primary pathogen was clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase e. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the  genus salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. pasteurella multocida or pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while toxocara canis and ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, campylobacter spp., microsporum canis, group a streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.

TI  == toxic megacolon complicating escherichia coli o157 infection.
AB  == toxic megacolon is a well known complication in inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease. the development of toxic megacolon as a complication of infectious colitis is rare. however it is recognised as a complication of enteric infections caused by clostridium difficile, campylobacter jejuni, shigella, salmonella species, cytomegalovirus and amoebae. we describe a  case of necrotising haemorrhagic ileo-colitis in a previously fit and healthy young adult female caused by escherichia coli o157 where toxic megacolon developed as a complication along with hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus).

TI  == inhibition of clostridium perfringens by a novel strain of bacillus subtilis isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic enteritis in poultry. one  of the bacteria isolated, a strain of bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an  anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the c. perfringens atcc 13124 used in this study. the anticlostridial factor produced by b. subtilis pb6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase, trypsin, and pepsin. in contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by treatment at 100 or 121 degrees c or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. the optimum growth temperature and optimum ph for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37 degrees c and 6.20, respectively. using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anticlostridial factor was estimated to be in the  range from 960 to 983 da. in terms of the antimicrobial spectrum, the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of c. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis in poultry, clostridium difficile, streptococcus pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, and campylobacter coli.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni pancolitis mimicking idiopathic ulcerative colitis.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of community-acquired acute bacterial diarrhea. campylobacter diarrhea is usually accompanied by fever and abdominal pain. campylobacter diarrhea is usually watery. nausea, vomiting, headache, and myalgias may also be present. tenesmus is a common feature. the majority of patients with campylobacter diarrhea have some component of segmental colitis, usually beginning in the small bowel and progressing distally to the cecum and colon. c. jejuni is a rare cause of pancolitis. community-acquired colitis may be caused by c. jejuni or other enteric pathogens, for example, shigella, entamoeba, yersinia, escherichia coli 0157:h7, clostridium difficile colitis, ischemic colitis, or idiopathic ulcerative colitis. we present a case of c. jejuni pancolitis in an elderly woman. differential diagnosis is included in the discussion. the patient's c. jejuni pancolitis was successfully treated with  a 7-day course of oral moxifloxacin.

TI  == microbial contamination of drinking water and disease outcomes in developing regions.
AB  == drinking water is a major source of microbial pathogens in developing regions, although poor sanitation and food sources are integral to enteric pathogen exposure. gastrointestinal disease outcomes are also more severe, due to under-nutrition and lack of intervention strategies in these regions. poor water  quality, sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide (3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all daly's), mainly through infectious diarrhoea. nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries. major enteric pathogens in these children include: rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp. and vibrio cholerae o1, and possibly enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp. v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile and cryptosporidium parvum. all except the latter are easily control by chlorination of water, but recontamination of treated water is  a huge problem. emerging environmental pathogens, such as helicobacter pylori and burkholderia pseudomallei, may well be of significance in some regions. in adults, much less is understood of various sequellae such as myocarditis, diabetes, reactive arthritis and cancers some months-years after initial infections. so in addition to the traditional pathogens (helminths, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia hepatitis a and e) various enteroviruses, c. jejuni  and h. pylori are emerging issues in adults.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == bacterial-associated diarrhea in the dog: a critical appraisal.
AB  == the clinical documentation of enteropathogenic bacteria causing diarrhea in dogs  is clouded by the presence of many of these organisms existing as normal constituents of the indigenous intestinal flora. the diagnosis of a putative bacterial enteropathogen(s) in dogs should be made based on a combination of parameters, including signalment and predisposing factors, clinical signs, serologic assays for toxins, fecal culture, and pcr. relying on results of fecal  culture alone is problematic, because c perfringens, c difficile, campylobacter spp, and pathogenic and non-pathogenic e coli are commonly isolated from apparently healthy dogs [10,13,33]. nevertheless, culture may be useful in procuring isolates for the application of molecular techniques, such as pcr, for  detection of specific toxin genes or molecular typing of isolated strains to establish clonality in suspected outbreaks. the oversimplistic attempt to characterize bacterially associated diarrhea by anatomic localization of clinical signs should be discouraged, because most of the previously mentioned bacteria have been associated with small and large intestinal diarrhea. accurate diagnosis of infections may require diagnostic laboratories to incorporate pcr-based assays using genus- and species-specific primers to facilitate detection of toxin genes  and differentiation of species that appear phenotypically and biochemically similar. there has been tremendous interest in the application of microarray technology for the simultaneous detection of thousands of genes or target dna sequences on one glass slide. this powerful tool could be used for detection of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in fecal specimens obtained from dogs in the future.

TI  == acute gastroenteritis in children : what role for antibacterials?
AB  == the aim of this article is to define the currently accepted role of antibacterials in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children. most cases  of acute gastroenteritis in children are viral, self-limited, and need only supportive treatment. appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, with close attention to nutrition, remain central to therapy.antibacterial therapy serves as an adjunct, to shorten the clinical course, eradicate causative organisms, reduce transmission, and prevent invasive complications. selection of antibacterials to  use in acute bacterial gastroenteritis is based on clinical diagnosis of the likely pathogen prior to definitive laboratory results. antibacterial therapy should be restricted to specific bacterial pathogens and disease presentations. in general, infections with shigella spp. and vibrio cholera should usually be treated with antibacterials, while antibacterials are only used in severe unresponsive infections with salmonella, yersinia, aeromonas, campylobacter, plesiomonas spp., and clostridium difficile. antibacterials should be avoided in  enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection. however, empiric therapy may be appropriate in the presence of a severe illness with bloody diarrhea and stool leucocytes, particularly in infancy and the immunocompromised. the benefits and risks of adverse drug reactions should be weighed before prescribing antibacterials. moreover, a major concern is the emergence of antibacterial-resistant strains due to the widespread use of antibacterial agents.

TI  == bacterial hemorrhagic enterocolitis.
AB  == bacterial diarrhea can be classified into two clinical entities, noninflammatory  diarrhea and inflammatory diarrhea syndromes. the latter type of diarrhea is characterized by bloody and puruloid mucus stool, and is often accompanied by fever, tenesmus, and severe abdominal pain. pathogenic bacteria causing the inflammatory diarrhea syndrome include salmonella, vibrio, shigella, enteroinvasive and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, campylobacter, yersinia, chlamydia, and clostridium difficile. the pathologic changes in the inflammatory  diarrhea syndrome range from a superficial exudative enterocolitis to a transmural enterocolitis with overt ulceration. this syndrome is also designated  as bacterial hemorrhagic enterocolitis because of its usual manifestation by bloody diarrhea. the diagnostic approach needs information on the patient's age,  travel history, epidemiological associations, sexual practice, and medical history, including usage of antibiotics. bacterial information can be obtained by microscopic study, culture, and the identification of specific bacterial toxins.  flexible colonoscopy with biopsy is useful for the differentiation of bacterial hemorrhagic enterocolitis from idiopathic ulcerative colitis and ischemic colitis. physicians should be familiar with the diagnostic modalities used to detect the specific pathogens causing hemorrhagic bacterial enterocolitis; namely, bacterial culture, serology, histology, and nucleic acid technologies.

TI  == abdominal infections in patients with acute leukaemia: a prospective study applying ultrasonography and microbiology.
AB  == a prospective study of 62 chemotherapy-induced neutropenic episodes in patients with acute leukaemia was conducted to determine the incidence and causes of abdominal infections, and to assess the diagnostic value of the combined use of ultrasonography (us) and microbiology. each patient underwent us of liver, gallbladder and complete bowel before chemotherapy, on days 2-4 after the end of  chemotherapy and in cases of fever, diarrhoea or abdominal pain. us was combined  with a standardized clinical examination and a broad spectrum of microbiological  investigations. from january to august 2001, 243 us examinations were performed.  the overall incidence of abdominal infectious diseases was 17.7% (11 out of 62, 95% confidence interval (ci): 9-29%). four patients (6.5%) developed neutropenic  enterocolitis; two of them died, two survived. bowel wall thickening (bwt) > 4 mm in these four patients ranged from 5.8 to 23.6 mm and was detected only in one patient with mucositis. in three other patients (4.8%) clostridium difficile, and in one patient (1.6%) campylobacter jejuni, caused enterocolitis without bwt. cholecystitis was diagnosed in three patients (4.8%) and hepatic candidiasis was  strongly suspected in one patient. abdominal infections caused by gastroenteritis viruses, cytomegalovirus (cmv) or cryptosporidium were not observed. we conclude  that in neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy: (i) bwt is not a feature of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and should therefore be considered as sign of infectious enterocolitis; (ii) viruses, classic bacterial enteric pathogens (salmonella, shigella, yersinia, campylobacter, aeromonas, vibrio subsp., enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli) and cryptosporidium have a very low incidence; and (iii) abdominal infections may be underestimated when us  is not used in every patient with abdominal pain.

TI  == [antagonistic activity of lactobacillus bacteria strains against anaerobic gastrointestinal tract pathogens (helicobacter pylori, campylobacter coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile)].
AB  == antagonistic activity of lactobacillus strains has been known for some time. this property is connected with production of many active substances by lactobacilli e.g., organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances which interfere with other indigenous microorganisms inhabiting the same ecological niche, including also anaerobic gastrointestinal tract pathogens. growing interest of clinical medicine in finding new approaches to treatment and prevention of common inflammatory infections of the digestive tract resulted in studies on a possible usage of lactic acid bacteria. last years, several in vitro and in vivo experiments on antagonism of different lactobacillus strains against helicobacter pylori and clostridium difficile were performed. these observations had been done on already established, well known probiotic lactobacillus strains. we tested antibacterial  activities of lactobacillus strains isolated from human digestive tract. as indicator bacteria, four species known as anaerobic bacterial etiologic agents of gastroenteric infections: helicobacter pylori, campylobacter jejuni, c. coli and  clostridium difficile were used. some of them were obtained from international collections, others were clinical isolates from specimens taken from patients with different defined gastrointestinal infections. we used a slab method of testing inhibitory activity described in details previously. following conclusions were drawn from our study: all tested human lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the growth of all strains of anaerobic human gastrointestinal pathogens used in this study. inhibitory activities of tested lactobacillus strains against helicobacter pylori, campylobacter spp., and clostridium difficile as measured by comparing mean diameters of the inhibition zones were similar. differences in susceptibility of individual indicator strains of campylobacter spp. and clostridium difficile to inhibitory activity of lactobacillus strains were small. a similar mechanism of inhibition of anaerobic  bacteria by lactobacilli is postulated.

(neural and hormonal mechanisms that regulate normal mucosal ion transport are not discussed.) the manner in which vibrio cholerae, several pathotypes of escherichia coli, several salmonella serotypes, rotavirus, campylobacter species, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia species and clostridium difficile perturb these mechanisms and cause diarrhea, is discussed. throughout the article, the main emphasis is on experimental studies designed to elucidate biological mechanisms and (where relevant) the microbial determinants responsible for diarrheal disease. allusions are also made to the involvement of host responses such as the inflammatory response, the production and release of potent cytokines and accelerated homeostatic responses (such as increased rates of crypt cell division seen in some infections), and the role that they play in pathophysiological fluid secretion.

AB  == a 1-year prospective study was conducted to identify enteropathogens in adults with diarrhea (n=851) and in healthy control subjects (n=203) by use of conventional laboratory methods. virulence factor genes for diarrheagenic escherichia coli were detected by polymerase chain reaction. enteropathogens were identified in 56% of patients and 16% of control subjects. the isolation rate was 65% for patients with symptoms for <1 week and for travelers; >1 pathogen was found in 11% of patients. the most frequent enteropathogens were campylobacter (13% of patients), clostridium difficile (13%), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  (8%), salmonella (7%), shigella (4%), blastocystis hominis (4%), calicivirus (3%), rotavirus (3%), enteroaggregative e. coli (2%), aeromonas (2%), giardia intestinalis (2%), cryptosporidium (2%), and astrovirus (2%). less frequently isolated (< or =1% of patients) were verotoxigenic e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enteroinvasive e. coli, entamoeba histolytica/entamoeba dispar, microsporidia, and adenovirus. fifty percent of the patients were hospitalized, and 43% needed intravenous fluids. the median duration of diarrhea was 14 days. clinical features were not helpful for predicting the etiology of diarrhea.

TI  == case-control study of enteropathogens associated with childhood diarrhea in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  == the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research, bangladesh, is a major  center for research into diarrheal diseases. the center treats more than 100,000  patients a year. to obtain useful information representative of all patients, a surveillance system in which a 4% systematic sample of all patients is studied in detail, including etiological agents of diarrhea, was installed in october 1979.  the first paper on etiology for the surveillance patients was published in 1982,  which identified a potential enteric pathogen in 66% of patients. in subsequent years, several new agents of diarrhea have been identified. to assess the importance of a broader spectrum of diarrheal agents including the ones identified relatively recently, we studied 814 children with diarrhea. the children were up to 5 years of age and were part of the surveillance system. they were matched with an equal number of community controls without diarrhea. the study was conducted from february 1993 to june 1994. a potential enteric pathogen was isolated from 74.8% of diarrheal children and 43.9% of control children (p =  0.0001). even though the first study was not a case-control study, it identified  rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp.  , and vibrio cholerae o1 as major pathogens. the present study identified these pathogens as being significantly associated with diarrhea. in addition, the study also identified six additional agents, including enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp., v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and cryptosporidium parvum, as being significantly associated with diarrhea. plesiomonas shigelloides, salmonella spp., diffusely adherent e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, entamoeba histolytica, and giardia lamblia were not significantly associated with diarrhea. enteroinvasive e. coli,  enterohemorrhagic e. coli, and cyclospora cayetanensis were not detected in any of the children. the major burden of diseases due to most pathogens occurred in the first year of life. as in the previous study, seasonal patterns were seen for diarrhea associated with rotavirus, v. cholerae, and enterotoxigenic e. coli, and infections with multiple pathogens were common. with a few exceptions, these findings are in agreement with those from other developing countries. this knowledge of a broader spectrum of etiological agents of diarrhea in the surveillance patients will help us plan studies into various aspects of diarrheal diseases in this population.

AB  == we compared the yield of intraluminal fluid culture to that of biopsy specimens obtained during colonoscopy for the diagnosis of bacterial colitis in 93 immunocompetent patients with a recent episode of diarrhea and macroscopic lesions of colitis. stool culture findings were also available for 68 patients. at least one bacterial pathogen was isolated from the biopsy specimen, intraluminal fluid, or stool from 48 patients (51.6%). salmonella species, clostridium difficile, klebsiella oxytoca, shigella species, and campylobacter species were recovered from 16 (17.2%), 15 (16.1%), 8 (8.6%), 7 (7.5%), and 4 (4.3%) of the patients, respectively. one shigella species and one k. oxytoca strain were isolated from biopsy specimens but not from intraluminal fluid, and intraluminal fluid was the only positive specimen in 12 cases (yielding 1 salmonella species, 2 shigella species, 2 k. oxytoca, and 7 c. difficile isolates). in nine cases out of 10, toxin b was detected only in intraluminal fluid. a correlation of 91.2% was observed between stool and intraluminal fluid cultures for salmonella, shigella, and campylobacter species isolations. culture  of biopsy specimens adds little to the diagnosis of infectious colitis, and stools and intraluminal fluids appear to have comparable value.

TI  == incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  == rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  more than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic  rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for c. difficile enterotoxin. however, 27 cefmetazole-induced  diarrheic cases were not associated with c. difficile. other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as campylobacter spp., bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., clostridium perfringens and clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. however, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. this was ascribed to the overgrowth of clostridium innocuum and clostridium sporogenes. there were no remarkable differences in changes in other  bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.

TI  == evaluation of routine enteric pathogens in hospitalized patients: a canadian perspective.
AB  == diarrhea is a frequently encountered problem in hospitalized patients. since nosocomial spread of routine enteric pathogens such as salmonella species, shigella species, campylobacter species and escherichia coli o:157 h:7 seldom occurs, testing for these organisms in patients hospitalized for longer than three days has been questioned. the goal of this study was to determine the length of hospitalization preceding detection of routine enteric pathogens and clostridium difficile cytotoxin, and to develop guidelines for enteric cultures from hospitalized patients. the enteric pathogens detected in 1991 were c difficile toxin b(+), 77%; campylobacter species, 10%; salmonella species, 9%; e  coli o:157 h:7, 3%; and shigella species, 1%. for 1992, these numbers were 86%, 9%, 3%, 2% and 0%, respectively. none of the routine enteric pathogens isolated in 1991 or 1992 was detected in patients after their second day of hospitalization. routine cultures for enteric pathogens on hospitalized patients  were eliminated in february 1993, and physician ordering practices were monitored. with the exception of one campylobacter isolate per year, all routine  enteric pathogens isolated in 1993 and 1994 were detected by the second day of hospitalization. compliance with the changed protocol was 76% measured over a four-month period in 1993 and 74% over the year 1994. savings of $3,648.10 were associated with rejecting 191 'inappropriate' specimens in 1994. it was concluded that routine enteric cultures are unnecessary for patients hospitalized more than two days, and that appreciable financial savings can be achieved if revised protocols for processing stool cultures are instituted. however, when enteric protocol changes are in place compliance must be evaluated to ensure appropriate  utilization.

TI  == two-year study of endemic enteric pathogens associated with acute diarrhea in new caledonia.
AB  == a longitudinal study of diarrheal disease among patients of all ages with acute diarrhea was carried out in new caledonia from january 1990 to december 1991. stool samples from 2,088 diarrheal patients were examined for parasites, rotavirus, and bacterial pathogens. potential sources of contamination (drinking  water, seawater and bovine and porcine feces) were investigated. one or more enteric pathogens were identified in 41.8 and 40.6% of the persons with diarrhea, in 1990 and 1991, respectively. salmonella spp., shigella spp., hep-2 cell adherent escherichia coli (diffuse adherent and enteroaggregative), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) (epec adherence factor-positive strains belonging to classical serotypes), localized adherent e. coli (non-epec), and enterotoxigenic e. coli were the frequently identified enteropathogenic bacteria. other major enteropathogens were entamoeba histolytica and giardia lamblia. campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, yersinia enterocolitica, and rotavirus were isolated from only a few patients. no vibrio spp., aeromonas spp., plesiomonas spp., shiga-like-toxin-producing e. coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, or enteroinvasive e. coli were identified. shiga-like  toxin i-producing e. coli were present in adult bovines and calves, and heat-stable enterotoxin ii-producing enterotoxigenic e. coli were found in pigs.

TI  == enterocecocolitis associated with escherichia coli and campylobacter-like organisms in a hamster (mesocricetus auratus) colony.
AB  == sporadic diarrhea and weight loss were observed in a breeding colony of syrian hamsters during a 2-year period. thirteen adult hamsters with diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss were examined. histologic lesions consisted of diffuse nonsuppurative enterocecocolitis and multifocal epithelial proliferation in the cecum and colon. goblet cell hyperplasia was extensive in the colonic mucosa of many hamsters. the hamsters in this colony had not been treated with antibiotics  nor was clostridium difficile isolated from any of the hamsters. in contrast to typical proliferative ileitis in hamsters, most hamsters involved in this outbreak were mature adults rather than weanlings, and lesions were predominantly inflammatory rather than proliferative and involved small intestine, cecum, and colon rather than ileum. the isolation of beta-hemolytic escherichia coli and demonstration of campylobacter-like organisms by transmission electron microscopy and warthin-starry staining suggest that these two agents were involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. further studies, however, are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of this enteric syndrome in hamsters.

AB  == in 23% of 576 diarrhea patients we were able to demonstrate putative bacterial pathogens. not included in this number is clostridium difficile which was found in 8 of 48 (8.3%) specimens analyzed. in addition to salmonella (8.2%), campylobacter (6.0%), aeromonas (2.7%), shigella (1.9%) and yersinia (0.8%) we identified verotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) in 10 patients (1.9%). vtec were found as frequently as shigella (occurring exclusively in patients returning from the tropics) and we propose that vtec should be routinely assayed  in patients with travel-associated diarrhea as well as in those with diarrhea presumably acquired in switzerland. established methods for identification of e.  coli o157:h7, which include screening for sorbitol-negative enterobacteriaceae and agglutination, are laborious and insensitive (only 1 of 10 patients with proven vtec infection positive). the other 9 patients were identified by means of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in 7 of these 9 patients we were able to isolate a verotoxigenic strain following a positive pcr result by screening large numbers of colonies. none of them belonged to the o157:h7 serogroup and, in addition, all were sorbitol-positive. the polymerase chain reaction as performed  in this study is easy to use, is applicable to large numbers of specimens, and can be regarded as the method of choice for demonstration of vtec in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.

AB  == to assess the association between symptomatic relapse of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) and superinfection with enteropathogenic microorganisms, we determined prospectively the incidence of infections with enteropathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and helminths in patients with confirmed longstanding ibd. sixty-four patients with ibd (49 with crohn's disease [cd] and 15 with ulcerative colitis [uc]) were consecutively enrolled in the study when relapse occurred. multiple biopsies for histological and microbiological investigations were taken  from all patients who were evaluated by colonoscopy. parallel stool specimens were investigated for the presence of enteropathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and helminths. in six patients, we detected clostridium difficile or toxin b (five cd, one uc), in one patient campylobacter jejuni (cd), and in another patient salmonella typhimurium (uc). enteropathogenic escherichia coli were isolated from three patients. investigation of biopsies for mycobacteria, microscopic examination of stool samples for helminths, and immunofluorescence for chlamydia  were negative in all patients. in summary, as we found enteropathogenic microorganisms so infrequently in patients with relapse of ibd, despite intensive microbiological screening by tissue sampling for detection of gut adherent bacteria, we believe that microorganisms play only a minor role in the exacerbation of ibd.

TI  == diarrhea in developed and developing countries: magnitude, special settings, and  etiologies.

TI  == [infectious diarrhea in the adult].
AB  == infectious diarrhoeas are usually divided into two types; toxinogenic and invasive. invasive diarrhoeas are copious and responsible for dehydration which is the principal clinical sign; mucosal lesions and bacteraemia are absent. the most typical of toxinogenic diarrhoeas is cholera, but enterotoxicogenic e. coli  and aeromonas infections have similar clinical features. in invasive diarrhoeas the responsible microorganisms penetrate into the epithelial cells of the intestine, producing fever and stools that contain blood and mucus. however, some organisms causing invasive diarrhoeas secrete cytotoxins; they include shigella spp., salmonella spp, some strains of e. coli, campylobacter jejuni and yersinia  spp. when diarrhoea occurs in patients under antibiotics pseudomembranous colitis due to the proliferation of clostridium difficile must be suspected; the diagnosis is suggested by endoscopy and confirmed by bacteriology. toxic and infectious diarrhoeas due to food are increasingly frequent; they are usually caused by salmonella spp., but sometimes by clostridium perfringens or staphylococcus aureus. in patients with suspected infectious diarrhoea symptomatic treatment combined or not with intestinal antibacterial agents is immediately initiated in most cases; stool cultures are reserved to severe or protracted diarrhoeas. specimens must be collected under the best conditions and  rapidly sent to the laboratory.

TI  == rapid method to detect shiga toxin and shiga-like toxin i based on binding to globotriosyl ceramide (gb3), their natural receptor.
AB  == shiga toxin and the closely related shiga-like toxins produced by escherichia coli represent a group of very similar cytotoxins that may play an important role in diarrheal disease and hemolytic uremic syndrome. these toxins have the same biologic activities and according to recent studies also share the same binding receptor, globotriosyl ceramide (gb3). they are currently detected, on the basis  of their ability to damage several cell lines, by using expensive and tedious assays that require facilities for and experience with tissue cultures and are therefore most suitable for research laboratories. we have developed a rapid method to detect shiga toxin and shiga-like toxin i based on specific binding to  their gb3 natural receptor, which was coated onto microdilution plates. bound toxin was then detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) with monoclonal antibodies. the sensitivity of the gb3 elisa was 0.2 ng (2 ng/ml) of purified toxin. the assay was positive with sonic extracts of shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 strain 6or (a shiga toxin producer), e. coli serotype o26:h11 strain h30, and e. coli serotype o157:h7 (both shiga-like toxin i producers). the assay was very specific in that no cross-reactivity was noted with purified cholera toxin, e. coli heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins, and clostridium difficile cytotoxin, or sonic extracts of other cytotoxin-producing organisms, such as other shigellae, pathogenic and nonpathogenic e. coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and aeromonas spp. these results were in complete agreement with a [3h]thymidine-labeled hela cell cytotoxicity assay and with detection of the structural genes by dna hybridization studies with a shiga-like toxin i probe. quantitative analysis showed a high correlation between gb3 elisa and hela cell assay when fractions obtained at various stages of toxin purification were examined by both methods (r = 0.99, p < 0.01). this rapid gb3 elisa is sensitive and specific and may be diagnostically useful in cytotoxin-related infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

AB  == a newly recognized syndrome characterized by an acute focal ulcerative ileocolitis, anemia and thrombocytopenic purpura in five juvenile cotton-top tamarins is described. the presentation and morphology of this syndrome is distinct from any other reported gastrointestinal disease reported in tamarins. traditional etiologies such as viruses, ingested toxins, campylobacter, salmonella and yersinia and clostridium difficile are not considered likely etiologic agents. nontraditional etiologies such as anaerobes or pathologic strains of escherichia coli are now being considered. this syndrome is of potential significance to ongoing research into the etiology of idiopathic tamarin colitis.

TI  == management and prevention of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == the etiology, pathogenesis, transmission and communicability, diagnosis, and management of infectious diarrhea are reviewed. infectious diarrhea is common in  both industrialized and unindustrialized areas of the world. better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis and identification of "new" enteric pathogens has resulted in the use of a variety of drugs to relieve symptoms or to effect a  clinical cure. both host and microbial virulence factors are key in the acquisition of diarrheal illness. host factors such as extreme age, a dysfunctional gastrointestinal tract, or underlying immunodeficiency enhance the  risk of illness after ingestion of a pathogen or its toxins. microbial virulence  factors (the pathogen's ability to invade or produce enterotoxins, neurotoxins, or cytotoxins) characterize the type of illness manifested and the symptom complex (e.g., acute watery diarrhea versus chronic dysentery). supportive care is indicated in the majority of cases of infectious enteritis, and rehydration is considered the mainstay of therapy in any diarrheal illness accompanied by dehydration. antimicrobial therapy is beneficial in the treatment of severe diarrhea caused by shigella, campylobacter spp., vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, and clostridium difficile. infectious diarrhea is common but is often self-limited and of short duration. therapy frequently consists of symptomatic relief and fluid replacement.

TI  == diagnosis of infectious diarrheal diseases.
AB  == for many years, microbiologic examination of feces was focused on the isolation of two members of the family enterobacteriaceae--salmonellae and shigellae. over  the past two decades, other enteric pathogens such as the various classes of diarrheagenic e. coli, campylobacter, vibrio spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and clostridium difficile have gained prominence. a newly recognized protozoan parasite, cryptosporidium is now known to infect both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. added to these is the growing list of viruses incriminated in diarrheal diseases and gastritis. this article provides some of the basic information needed to allow for the isolation and identification of many of the currently recognized enteric pathogens. it also provides information  on some of the currently available rapid test procedures that will speed up stool specimen testing and allow for more timely reporting to the physician.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of pd127,391, a new quinolone.
AB  == mics of pd127,391 a new 4-quinolone, and of ci934 and ciprofloxacin, two previously reported 4-quinolones, were determined for common clinical bacterial isolates by an agar-dilution method. pd127,391 was the most active drug against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp (mics less than 0.12 mg/l) and as active as ciprofloxacin against aeromonas spp. (mics less than 0.008 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics less than 1 mg/l). it was more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas spp. including ps. maltophilia (mics less than  0.25 mg/l). all three drugs had high activity, with pd129,391 again the best, against haemophilus influenzae brahmamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. pd127,391 was much more active than the other drugs against campylobacter coli/jejuni (pd127,391 mics less than 0.03 mg/l) and gardnerella vaginalis (pd127,391 mics less than 0.25 mg/l). pd127,391 inhibited all staphylococci at less than 0.06 mg/l and streptococci at less than 0.5 mg/l, thus being more active than ci934 or ciprofloxacin. pd127,391 was much more active against anaerobic cocci, bacteroides spp. and clostridia (including clostridium difficile) (mics less than 1 mg/l) than was ci934 (mics less than 16 mg/l) or ciprofloxacin (mics less than 64 mg/l). no bacterium that we examined required more than 1 mg/l of pd127,391 for inhibition, and there was no cross resistance with unrelated antibiotics.

AB  == in diverse parts of the world, many bacterial strains have been recognised as the causative agents of diarrhoea. great achievements have been made in perceiving the varied mechanisms which explain their intestinal pathogenicity. these achievements include the elucidation of the 5 mechanisms of disease production by escherichia coli, the mechanisms of action of shigella, salmonella, campylobacter and yersinia, new information about antimicrobial-associated colitis caused by clostridium difficile and the recognition of microbes such as aeromonas hydrophila and pleisomonas shigelloides. information is available on the use and  indications of antimicrobial treatment in children with diarrhoea of bacterial aetiology which is proven or suspected by clinical symptomatology or simple laboratory procedures. finally, the usefulness of oral rehydrating solutions has  been appreciated in the prevention as well as in the correction of diarrhoeal dehydration.

AB  == azithromycin (cp-62,993 [9-deoxy-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin]) is a novel macrolide antimicrobial. in this study the in vitro activity of cp-62,993 has been determined against selected enteropathogens, including clostridium difficile, and compared with that of erythromycin. mics were determined using an  agar incorporation technique in mueller-hinton medium, containing saponin-lysed horse blood at a final concentration of 10% v/v, with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. cp-62,993 was considerably more active than erythromycin against salmonella typhi (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l, respectively), s. enteritidis (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), shigella flexneri (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. dysenteriae (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. sonnei (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), campylobacter jejuni (mic90 0.12 and 1 mg/l), vibrio cholerae (mic90 0.25 and 8 mg/l), v. parahaemolyticus (mic90 0.5 and 8 mg/l), yersinia enterocolitica (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), escherichia coli-etec (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), e. coli-eiec  (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), plesiomonas shigelloides (mic90 1 and 8 mg/l) and aeromonas hydrophila (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l). cp-62,993 (mic90 2 mg/l) was slightly less active than erythromycin (mic90 1 mg/l) against isolates of c. difficile. the results suggest a potential clinical role for cp-62,993 in the treatment of enteric infections where antimicrobial therapy is indicated.

TI  == production of a unique cytotoxin by campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is an important diarrheal pathogen worldwide; the mechanisms by which it causes disease remain unclear. because of its association with inflammatory diarrhea, we postulated that c. jejuni might produce a cytotoxin similar to that produced by shigella sp., enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157, or clostridium difficile. filtrates of 12 polymyxin-treated isolates of c.  jejuni were placed on hela cells (sensitive to shiga toxin cytotoxicity) and chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells. of 12 isolates of c. jejuni tested, 5 killed 50% of the cells at greater than or equal to 1:4 dilutions of filtered suspensions of 10(9) bacteria per ml; killing was similar in hela and cho cells (the cho cells being insensitive to shiga cytotoxin). one isolate produced a titer of 1:32 to 1:128. the relative potency in hela cells was comparable to that of e. coli strains that produce intermediate amounts of shiga-like toxin. the other seven strains showed no cytotoxic effect, nor did the control diluents, polymyxin b, or supernatants of c. jejuni not treated with polymyxin b. sonication also released active cytotoxin, but slightly less well than did polymyxin. the cytotoxic effect was dose dependent. concentration of the c. jejuni in suspension by 10-fold before treatment with polymyxin b resulted in a 10-fold increase in the 50% cytotoxic dose. the cytotoxin effect was not neutralized by shiga toxin immune serum against either shiga-like toxin i or ii or by anti-clostridium difficile antiserum. the c jejuni cytotoxin was partially  labile to trypsin (0.25%) and to heating to greater than or equal to 60 degrees c. cytotoxicity was retained in scientific products dialysis tubing d1615-1 (mr cutoff, 12,000 to 14,000). some isolates of c. jejuni release a substance lethal  to hela or cho cells in vitro that is distinct from shiga-like or clostridium difficile toxin. this cytotoxin may contribute to the colonic mucosal invasive process that characterizes c. jejuni enteritis.

AB  == acute gastroenteritis (ge) among 214 children (aged 6 months-7 years) attending day-care centres (ddcs) in the copenhagen county was studied during a 12-month period. a total of 197 cases of ge was observed in 109 children (i.e. 51% of the  participants). the aetiology was as follows: rotavirus (n = 48) (24%), pathogenic bacteria (n = 11) (6%), giardia lamblia (n = 3) (2%), while the aetiology of 68%  remains unknown. the pathogenic bacteria included yersinia enterocolitica, thermophilic campylobacter, clostridium difficile (+/- toxin) and enteropathogenic e. coli. in 4% of the ge the infections were multiple and cryptosporidium was seen in one of these cases. the rate of ge declined with age  from 1.35 ge per child per year (age group 1.0- less than 2.0 years) to 0.36 (6.0- less than 8.0 years). serum sampled at the start of the study period showed that the frequency of detectable rotavirus igg increased with age from 48% in the 6 months- less than 1.0 year group to 96% in the 4.0- less than 7.0 year group. the highest rates of rotavirus ge occurred from january to april (i.e. the rotavirus season). moreover, rotavirus ge was almost absent after the age of 4. hence, the rates of rotavirus ge per rotavirus season per child were 0.80 (age group 6 months-less than 1.0 year), 0.32 (1.0-less than 2.0), 0.14 (2.0-less than 3.0), 0.16 (3.0-less than 4.0), 0.06 (4.0-less than 5.0) and 0.04 (5.0-less than  6.0). only 2 out of the 48 rotavirus ge were reinfections.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == bacterial diarrhoea.
AB  == bacterial infections are important causes of diarrhoea in infants and children, particularly in developing countries and in other settings where standards of personal and community hygiene are low. knowledge of bacterial diarrhoeas has been significantly expanded in recent years by the finding that many episodes of  acute diarrhoea are due to infections with bacteria which produce enterotoxins that interfere with intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport (the 'enterotoxigenic' diarrhoeas). several 'newer' bacterial agents have also been identified which would not have been detected in earlier studies of the epidemiology of infective diarrhoeas; these include aeromonas, campylobacter, clostridium difficile and yersinia. another important advance has been new knowledge about mechanisms by which bacteria cause diarrhoea; this has led to the widespread successful application of oral rehydration therapy in treatment of acute watery diarrhoeas.

TI  == [epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  == diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. about one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. among the viral  infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear  to occur worldwide. enteropathogenic (epec) and, especially, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. campylobacter jejuni and c. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. yersinia enterocolitica is rare in  tropical countries. cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (v. cholerae non-01, v. mimicus, v. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. clostridium perfringens type c is the causal agent of enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially new guinea. c. difficile appears to be of minor importance. among the parasites giardia lamblia  and entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella  and e. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.

TI  == evaluation and diagnosis of acute infectious diarrhea.
AB  == the appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of acute infectious diarrhea is determined by the frequency and setting of the illness, the recognizable causes or syndromes, the cost and yield of available diagnostic tests, and the treatability of the disease. acute diarrhea affects everyone throughout the world from one to more than six times each year, depending on age, location, and living conditions. the range of identifiable viral, bacterial, and  parasitic etiologies is great, and the cost of indiscriminate use of etiologic studies for diagnosis is prohibitive. because of its insensitivity for many organisms and poor selection of cases for testing, routine stool culture has been one of the most costly and ineffective microbiologic tests; the cost per positive result has traditionally exceeded $900 to $1,000. the appropriate treatment for the vast majority of cases (independent of their cause) is simple and effective:  oral glucose- and electrolyte-containing rehydration solution. on the basis of an appropriate history and understanding of pathogenesis, fecal specimens can be selectively obtained and promptly examined for leukocytes and parasites, and the  common noninflammatory diarrheas can be separated from the inflammatory infections in order to focus further studies on the latter group. the bacteria for which specific antimicrobial therapy should be considered usually cause inflammatory diarrhea in the united states. therefore, only when the history or fecal leukocyte findings indicates an inflammatory process is it appropriate to culture for the routine invasive bacterial pathogens. in sporadic inflammatory diarrhea, culture methods should include those for campylobacter jejuni as well as salmonella and shigella. several special circumstances may prompt a consideration of parasites (including giardia, entamoeba, strongyloides, cryptosporidium), vibrio, yersinia, clostridium difficile, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, food-borne agents, or sexually transmitted pathogens. the practical value of specific identification of rotaviruses (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, rotazyme, or electron microscopy) is primarily epidemiologic, particularly in hospitalized infants or young children. using such a selective approach to fecal culture will greatly increase its yield and can reduce the cost per positive result from $1,000 to less than $150.

AB  == the four major mechanisms of diarrhea are osmotic forces, secretory forces, exudation from a disrupted intestinal mucosa, and disturbed intestinal motility.  in many illnesses, more than one mechanism produces diarrhea. the rotaviruses and the norwalk viruses have recently been recognized as common causes of viral gastroenteritis. also, the major cause of antibiotic-associated colitis is now known to be an overgrowth of clostridium difficile. campylobacter has also been identified as a common cause of acute bacterial diarrhea both abroad and in canada. most cases of travellers' diarrhea are caused by strains of escherichia coli to which the traveller has little immunity. most travellers who develop diarrhea benefit from treatment with diphenoxylate, loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate. the few patients who develop more severe, incapacitating diarrhea  are candidates for treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. antibiotics should not be used to prevent travellers' diarrhea, because antibiotic resistance is becoming a problem.

AB  == the number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new  pathogens. neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. although enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in u.s. travelers to tropical areas, campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the united states about  as often as do salmonella and shigella. vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion  of improperly cooked and stored rice in chinese restaurants. although yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the united states, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin (mk-0366, am-715) and other agents against gastrointestinal tract pathogens.
AB  == a comparison was made of the in vitro activities of norfloxacin and of nine other orally administered antibacterial agents against 180 clinical isolates representing the bacterial species most frequently implicated in infections of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. the 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations showed norfloxacin to be 4, 15, 4, 17, 17, 17, and 33 times more active than the  next best compound tested against campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni, escherichia  coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp., vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively, with an overall 90% minimal inhibitory concentration of less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. norfloxacin was least active against clostridium difficile (90% minimal inhibitory concentration, 128 micrograms/ml). these results should encourage further evaluation of norfloxacin  as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of enteric bacterial infections for which antibiotic therapy is indicated.

TI  == enteropathogenicity: recent developments.
AB  == recent studies have added important new information to our understanding of the pathogenesis and ethiology of diarrheal disease. vibrio cholerae produces a heat-labile enterotoxin, affecting cyclic amp. a very similar heat-labile enterotoxin is produced also by certain strains of escherichia coli, as well as by citrobacter, klebsiella, and aeromonas. e. coli may also produce a heat-stable enterotoxin, stimulating guanylate cyclase activity. in order to produce the pathologic effects, e. coli first attaches to epithelial cells of the intestinal  tract by means of pili or surface antigens. enterotoxin can be demonstrated by both in vivo and in vitro tests, but none are yet suitable for routine diagnostic laboratories. a third mechanism whereby e. coli causes diarrheal disease consists of enteroinvasiveness. campylobacter, yersinia, and clostridium difficile have been added to the list of enteric pathogens of man.

TI  == aetiology of acute diarrhoea in adults.
AB  == we have studied 73 adults with acute diarrhoea and identified a micro-organism or toxin likely to be the cause in 58%. in addition to routinely cultured bacteria,  campylobacter coli/jejuni and clostridium difficile were important pathogens in the community. patients who developed diarrhoea after antibiotic use had a distinctive clinical syndrome and comprised the third largest group of cases. clinical, epidemiological, and histological features in an additional group with  negative cultures and no antibiotic history suggest that an additional bacterial  pathogen remains to be identified as a cause of acute diarrhoea in adults.
