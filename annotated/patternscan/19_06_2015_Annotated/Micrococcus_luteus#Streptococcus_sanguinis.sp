TI  == [microflora of the inflammatory erosive areas of the esophagus in esophagitis patients].
AB  == seven patients with erosive esophagitis and reflux esophagitis were examined. in  cases of inflammatory erosive phenomena staphylococci, micrococcus luteus, candida, bacteria of the genera pseudomonas, veilonella, klebsiella and other bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae, as well as helicobacter pylori were detected in different frequency. in most cases concentrations of microorganisms were 4.07-5.39 ig cfu/g. isolated microorganisms producing different pathogenicity enzymes--hemolysin (streptococcus intermedius, s. sanguis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, s. warneri, bacteroides spp.), lecithinase (staphylococcus xylosus), caseinase, rnaase and catalase--were detected.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.
