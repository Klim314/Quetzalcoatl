TI  == a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria  in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of  s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral  biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial  activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == activity of in vitro forms of dentifrices containing the hydroalcoholic extract of the ripe fruit of eugenia uniflora l. (surinam cherry) on cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of dentifrices containing the hydroalcoholic extract of the ripe fruit of eugenia uniflora l. (surinam cherry) on streptococcus oralis (atcc 10557) and lactobacillus casei (atcc 7469). five dentifrices were used: d1: containing hydroalcoholic extract of eugenia uniflora l.; d2: containing fluoride and hydroalcoholic extract of eugenia uniflora l.; d3: containing triclosan and hydroalcoholic extract of eugenia uniflora l; d4: containing triclosan, fluoride and hydroalcoholic extract of eugenia uniflora l.; d5: positive control (colgate total 12). to determine the antibacterial activity, the technique used was the minimum inhibitory concentration by the diffusion method in solid culture medium. at the concentration 0.05 g/ml, the best results were achieved with d1 (18 mm) and d4 (24 mm) on l.casei, and with d3 (19 mm) on s. oralis. the dentifrices d3 and d4 were found to have greater activity on the streptococcus oralis, while d4 and d1  were found to have greater activity on lactobaccilus casei. it is concluded that  dentifrices with eugenia uniflora l. have antimicrobial activity, suggesting that clinical trials should be conducted.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  == purpose: to examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. methods: comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated  toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. the following microorganisms were investigated: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. for cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (cfus), columbia blood agar plates or sabouraud agar were used. the cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. the rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. all experiments were done twice and  the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. results: there was no significant reduction in cfus by silver-coated toothbrushes (p > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. on the contrary, the colony counts for s. sanguis (p = 0.02) and c. albicans (p = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide paste.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of different root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide (ch) paste. materials and methods: the sample was composed of two sealers (fill canal((r)) and sealer 26((r))), one ch cement (hydro c((r))), and a ch paste. the agar diffusion test was performed in petri dishes inoculated with the following microorganisms: streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, candida krusei, and candida tropicalis. the diameters of the zones of microbial growth inhibition were measured after 24 h. the tests were performed in triplicate. data were analyzed statistically by anova and tukey's test at 5% significance level. results: fill canal((r)) exhibited the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against the candida species and  differed significantly from the other groups (p < 0.001). when inhibition was observed against s. mitis and s. oralis, the ch paste presented a larger mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than those of the other materials (p < 0.05). regarding the inhibition of s. mutans, a statistically significant difference was observed only between the ch paste and hydro c((r)) (p < 0.05); the paste produced the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against this microorganism. regarding the inhibition of s. salivarius, fill canal((r)) presented smaller mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than sealer 26((r)) and ch paste (p < 0.05). conclusion: all the materials presented zones of microbial growth inhibition against all the test bacteria. fill canal((r)) presented the largest mean zone of inhibition against the candida species. for the streptococcus cultures, none of the sealers presented inhibition superior to  that of the ch paste.

TI  == biofilm formation and virulence expression by streptococcus mutans are altered when grown in dual-species model.
AB  == background: microbial cell-cell interactions in the oral flora are believed to play an integral role in the development of dental plaque and ultimately, its pathogenicity. the effects of other species of oral bacteria on biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, were evaluated using a dual-species biofilm model and realtime-pcr analysis. results: as compared to mono-species biofilms, biofilm formation by s. mutans was significantly decreased when grown with streptococcus  sanguinis, but was modestly increased when co-cultivated with lactobacillus casei. co-cultivation with s. mutans significantly enhanced biofilm formation by  streptococcus oralis and l. casei, as compared to the respective mono-species biofilms. realtime-pcr analysis showed that expression of spap (for multi-functional adhesin spap, a surface-associated protein that s. mutans uses to bind to the tooth surface in the absence of sucrose), gtfb (for glucosyltransferase b that synthesizes alpha1,6-linked glucan polymers from sucrose and starch carbohydrates) and gbpb (for surface-associated protein gbpb,  which binds to the glucan polymers) was decreased significantly when s. mutans were co-cultivated with l. casei. similar results were also found with expression of spap and gbpb, but not gtfb, when s. mutans was grown in biofilms with s. oralis. compared to mono-species biofilms, the expression of luxs in s. mutans co-cultivated with s. oralis or l. casei was also significantly decreased. no significant differences were observed in expression of the selected genes when s. mutans was co-cultivated with s. sanguinis. conclusions: these results suggest that the presence of specific oral bacteria differentially affects biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by s. mutans.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of caesalpinia ferrea martius fruits against oral pathogens.
AB  == aim: in the amazon region of brazil, the fruits of caesalpinia ferrea martius (brazilian ironwood) are widely used as an antimicrobial and healing medicine in  many situations including oral infections. this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of caesalpinia ferrea martius fruit extract against oral pathogens. materials and methods: polyphenols estimation and spectral analysis ((1)h nmr) of the methanol extract were carried out. the microorganisms candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis and lactobacillus casei were tested using the microdilution method for planktonic cells (mic) and a multispecies biofilm model. chlorhexidine was used as positive  control. results: polyphenols in the extract were estimated at 7.3% and (1)h nmr  analysis revealed hydroxy phenols and methoxilated compounds. mic values for candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis and lactobacillus casei were 25.0, 40.0, 66.0, 100.0, 66.0 microg/ml, respectively. for the biofilm assay, chlorhexidine and plant extract showed no growth at 10(-4) and 10(-5) microbial dilution, respectively. at 10(-4) and 10(-5) the growth values (mean+/-sd) of the negative controls (dmso and saline solution) for streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sp. and candida albicans were 8.1+/-0.7, 7.0+/-0.6 and 5.9+/-0.9 x 10(6)cfu, respectively. conclusion: caesalpinia ferrea fruit extract can inhibit in vitro growth of oral pathogens in planktonic and biofilm models supporting its use for oral infections.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == effects of three different infant dentifrices on biofilms and oral microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of infant dentifrices: a--with lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and lactoferrin; b--with 1100 ppm of naf and sodium lauryl sulfate; c--with extract of calendula. the dentifrices were test on biofilms formed in vitro from saliva and dental plaque of infants, using  reference strains a. viscosus (atcc 43146); c. albicans (atcc 51501); l. casei (atcc 4646); s. mitis (atcc 49456); s. mutans (atcc 25175); s. oralis (atcc 35037); s. sanguis (atcc 10586); s. sobrinus (atcc 27609) and isolated clinically microorganisms c. albicans, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus and lactobacillus sp. twenty infants were chosen, who were beginning treatment at the infants clinic of the pediatric dentistry department, federal university of rio de janeiro. a pool of unstimulated saliva and a pool of dental  plaque were collected from which biofilms were produced. supernatants from each dentifrice were prepared and concentrated and diluted solutions of the dentifrices and a control sterile diluent were tested against the biofilms produced, for 1 and 3 minutes, and against the microorganisms. the results were statistically analyzed by the anova and tukey test. after the exposure of the biofilms produced both from saliva and from dental plaque, to the dentifrice b concentrated and 1/2, for 1 and 3 minutes, the viable microorganisms count (cfu/ml), compared to the controls, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). however, exposure to the dentifrices a and c concentrated and dentifrice b 1/4 and 1/8, for 1 and 3 minutes, was not significantly lethal to the biofilms. the dentifrices a and c, either concentrated or diluted (1/2 to 1/128) and the dentifrice b in the dilutions 1/16 to 1/128 did not have an antimicrobial effect  on any microorganism evaluated. for all the microorganisms evaluated, the dentifrice b concentrated and in the 1/2 dilution showed a significant antimicrobial effect, when compared with the control (p < 0.05).

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == in vitro study of antibacterial and antiadhesive activities of fluoride-containing light-cured fissure sealants and a glass ionomer liner/base against oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to estimate the antibacterial and anti-adhesive properties of light-cured pit-and-fissure sealants containing fluoride (teethmate f-1, tf; ultrasea-1 xt, us) or not containing fluoride (teethmate a, ta)- and glass ionomer liner/base containing fluoride (vitrebond, vb) against oral bacteria in vivo. vb inhibited the growth of s. mutans, s. oralis and l. casei aerobically and anaerobically, and ta and us inhibited the growth of only s. mutans aerobically. the numbers of adherent cells mediated by insoluble glucan for all materials were lower than that for the control tooth. the numbers of adhesional cells not mediated by insoluble glucan were larger than that for the control tooth. vb showed the highest concentration of fluoride released throughout the four-week observation period, and had the highest ph value. in this study, vb showed superior antibacterial action and fluoride-release compared with the other three materials.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == investigation of calcium-binding sites on the surfaces of selected gram-positive  oral organisms.
AB  == dental plaque is rich in anionic groups with a high calcium-binding capacity which may affect mineral dynamics at the tooth surface. the two major calcium-binding sites on gram-positive cell surfaces are carboxylate groups (in proteins and peptidoglycan cross-links) and phosphate groups (in lipoteichoic and teichoic acid). equilibrium dialysis was used to measure calcium-binding capacities of whole cells and purified cell-wall material (cwm) from streptococcus mutans r9, strep. oralis ef186, strep. gordonii nctc 7865, strep. downei nctc 11391, actinomyces naeslundii wvu627 and lactobacillus casei ac413. this material was stripped of phosphate (ps-cwm) and treated to mask carboxylate  groups (cm-cwm). whole-cell calcium-binding capacities ranged from 240 (strep. downei) to 50 (l. casei) mu mol/g (dry wt). differences in cwm, ps-cwm and cm-cwm calcium-binding capacities demonstrated the greater importance of phosphate in comparison with carboxylate groups in cell calcium binding. these data indicate that, in streptococci, calcium binding is predominantly phosphate group-based, especially in the teichoic acid-containing strep. oralis. in the other species tested, calcium binding is predominantly carboxylate group-based.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
