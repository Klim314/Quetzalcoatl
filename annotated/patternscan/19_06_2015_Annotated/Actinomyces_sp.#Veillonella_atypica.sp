TI  == nitrate reductase activity of bacteria in saliva of term and preterm infants.
AB  == the salivary glands of adults concentrate nitrate from plasma into saliva where it is converted to nitrite by bacterial nitrate reductases. nitrite can play a beneficial role in adult gastrointestinal and cardiovascular physiology. when nitrite is swallowed, some of it is converted to nitric oxide (no) in the stomach and may then exert protective effects in the gastrointestinal tract and throughout the body. it has yet to be determined either when newborn infants acquire oral nitrate reducing bacteria or what the effects of antimicrobial therapy or premature birth may be on the bacterial processing of nitrate to nitrite. we measured nitrate and nitrite levels in the saliva of adults and both  preterm and term human infants in the early weeks of life. we also measured oral  bacterial reductase activity in the saliva of both infants and adults, and characterized the species of nitrate reducing bacteria present. oral bacterial conversion of nitrate to nitrite in infants was either undetectable or markedly lower than the conversion rates of adults. no measurable reductase activity was found in infants within the first two weeks of life, despite the presence of oral nitrate reducing bacteria such as actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella atypica, and rothia mucilaginosa. we conclude that relatively little nitrite reaches the infant gastrointestinal tract due to the lack of oral bacterial nitrate reductase activity. given the importance of the nitrate-nitrite-no axis in adults, the lack of oral nitrate-reducing bacteria in infants may be relevant to the vulnerability of newborns to hypoxic stress and gastrointestinal tract pathologies.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial nitrate reduction in the human oral cavity.
AB  == it is hypothesized that the enterosalivary nitrate circulation encourages nitrate reducing bacteria to reside within the oral cavity. nitrite production may then limit the growth of acidogenic bacteria as a result of the production of antimicrobial oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide. this study was carried  out with 10 subjects to characterize oral nitrate reduction and identify the bacteria responsible. nitrate reduction varied between individuals (mean 85.4 +/- 15.9 nmol nitrite min(-1) with 10 ml 1 mm kno(3) mouth wash) and was found to be  concentrated at the rear of the tongue dorsal surface. nitrate reductase positive isolates identified, using 16s rdna sequencing, from the tongue comprised veillonella atypica (34%), veillonella dispar (24%), actinomyces odontolyticus (21%), actinomyces naeslundii (2%), rothia mucilaginosa (10%), rothia dentocariosa (3%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (5%). nitrite production rates,  using intact and permeabilized cells, of the major tongue nitrate reducers were determined in the presence of methyl and benzyl viologen. under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, rates in decreasing order were: a. odontolyticus > r. mucilaginosa > r. dentocariosa > v. dispar > v. atypica. in conclusion, veillonella spp. were found to be the most prevalent taxa isolated and thus may make a major contribution to nitrate reduction in the oral cavity.

TI  == development of a multispecies oral bacterial community in a saliva-conditioned flow cell.
AB  == microbial communities within the human oral cavity are dynamic associations of more than 500 bacterial species that form biofilms on the soft and hard tissues of the mouth. understanding the development and spatial organization of oral biofilms has been facilitated by the use of in vitro models. we used a saliva-conditioned flow cell, with saliva as the sole nutritional source, as a model to examine the development of multispecies biofilm communities from an inoculum containing the coaggregation partners streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella atypica, and fusobacterium nucleatum. biofilms inoculated with individual species in a sequential order were compared with biofilms inoculated with coaggregates of the four species. our results indicated that flow cells inoculated sequentially produced biofilms with larger biovolumes compared to those biofilms inoculated with coaggregates. individual-species biovolumes within the four-species communities also differed between the two modes of inoculation. fluorescence in situ hybridization with genus- and species-specific probes revealed that the majority of cells in both sequentially and coaggregate-inoculated biofilms were s. gordonii, regardless of  the inoculation order. however, the representation of a. naeslundii and v. atypica was significantly higher in biofilms inoculated with coaggregates compared to sequentially inoculated biofilms. thus, these results indicate that the development of multispecies biofilm communities is influenced by coaggregations preformed in planktonic phase. coaggregating bacteria such as certain streptococci are especially adapted to primary colonization of saliva-conditioned surfaces independent of the mode of inoculation and order of addition in the multispecies inoculum. preformed coaggregations favor other bacterial strains and may facilitate symbiotic relationships.

TI  == isolation and characterization of coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis).
AB  == streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) bears coaggregation-mediating surface adhesins which recognize galactoside-containing surface polysaccharides on streptococcus oralis 34, streptococcus oralis c104, and streptococcus sm pk509. fifty-nine spontaneously-occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of s. gordonii dl1 unable to coaggregate with partner streptococci were isolated. six representative cog- mutants were characterized by their coaggregation properties  with four actinomyces naeslundii strains (t14v, pk947, pk606, pk984), veillonella atypica pk1910, and propionibacterium acnes pk93. the six representative cog- mutants showed altered coaggregation with their streptococcal partners, a. naeslundii pk947, and p. acnes pk93. based on the coaggregation phenotypes of these mutants, a model for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation between s. gordonii dl1 and its partner bacteria is proposed. the potential use of these mutants in studies of oral biofilms is discussed.

TI  == coaggregation properties of human oral veillonella spp.: relationship to colonization site and oral ecology.
AB  == the primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. all 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were veillonella atypica or veillonella dispar. all but one of them coaggregated with strains of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. these tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the  subgingival flora such as actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus sanguis. in contrast, 24 of 29 veillonella isolates, of which 20 were veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of actinomyces, s. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with s. salivarius. the majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. these results indicate that the three human oral veillonella species  are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.
