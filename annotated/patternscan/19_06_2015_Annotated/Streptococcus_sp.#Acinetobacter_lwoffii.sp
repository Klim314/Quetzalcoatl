TI  == efficacy and safety of lomefloxacin on bacterial extraocular disease in the horse.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic used for the treatment of bacterial extraocular disease. this study investigated the efficacy  and safety of lomefloxacin eye drops for bacterial extraocular disease in horses. lomefloxacin ophthalmic solution (0.3%) was instilled three times daily for 2-5 days in 65 horses diagnosed with bacterial extraocular disease based on clinical  findings. clinical observations and bacteriological examinations were performed at the start of treatment, 2 and 5 days after the start of treatment, and at the  discontinuation or termination of treatment. of the 65 horses, 64 were positive for bacteria, and 22 bacterial genera and 47 bacterial species were identified. the efficacy of lomefloxacin was evaluated in 63 horses; one horse with a negative culture and another with suspected bacterial contamination were excluded. lomefloxacin was considered to be clinically effective in 54 horses. the major bacterial species identified were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus  equi subsp. zooepidemicus, acinetobacter lwoffii, staphylococcus xylosus, staphylococcus vitulinus, enterobacter agglomerans, flavimonas oryzihabitans and  staphylococcus sciuri, with a cumulative disappearance rate of 80% or more at the termination of instillation. excluding one horse that did not undergo a bacteriological examination, the remaining 62 horses were assessed for bacteriological outcome. full or partial bacterial clearance was detected in 95%  or more of the 62 horses. one of the 65 horses reported adverse events that had no causal relation with the eye drops. our results showed that lomefloxacin is safe and effective for the treatment of bacterial extraocular disease in horses.

TI  == identification of host-immune response protein candidates in the sera of human oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.
AB  == one of the most common cancers worldwide is oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc),  which is associated with a significant death rate and has been linked to several  risk factors. notably, failure to detect these neoplasms at an early stage represents a fundamental barrier to improving the survival and quality of life of oscc patients. in the present study, serum samples from oscc patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) and silver staining in order to identify biomarkers that might allow early diagnosis. in this regard, 2-de spots corresponding to various  up- and down-regulated proteins were sequenced via high-resolution maldi-tof mass spectrometry and analyzed using the mascot database. we identified the following  differentially expressed host-specific proteins within sera from oscc patients: leucine-rich alpha2-glycoprotein (lrg), alpha-1-b-glycoprotein (abg), clusterin (clu), pro2044, haptoglobin (hap), complement c3c (c3), proapolipoprotein a1 (proapo-a1), and retinol-binding protein 4 precursor (rbp4). moreover, five non-host factors were detected, including bacterial antigens from acinetobacter lwoffii, burkholderia multivorans, myxococcus xanthus, laribacter hongkongensis,  and streptococcus salivarius. subsequently, we analyzed the immunogenicity of these proteins using pooled sera from oscc patients. in this regard, five of these candidate biomarkers were found to be immunoreactive: clu, hap, c3, proapo-a1 and rbp4. taken together, our immunoproteomics approach has identified  various serum biomarkers that could facilitate the development of early diagnostic tools for oscc.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

TI  == design and application of an oligonucleotide microarray for the investigation of  compost microbial communities.
AB  == a microarray consisting of oligonucleotide probes targeting variable regions of the 16s rrna gene was designed and tested for the investigation of microbial communities in compost. probes were designed for microorganisms that have been previously reported in the composting process and for plant, animal and human pathogens. the oligonucleotide probes were between 17 and 25 bp in length and included mostly species-specific sequences. validation of probe specificity and optimization of hybridization conditions were conducted using fluorescently labeled 16s rrna gene pcr products of pure culture strains. a labeling method employing a cy3 or cy5-labeled forward primer together with a phosphate-conjugated reverse primer for the production of single stranded dna after a digestion step was optimised and used to label target dna. a combination  of two different dna extraction methods using both physical and chemical lysis was found to give the best dna yields. increased hybridization signal intensities were obtained for probes modified with a 12 mer t-spacer. the microarray was found to have a detection limit of 10(3) cells, although in compost spiking experiments, the detection limit was reduced to 10(5) cells. the application of the microarray to compost samples indicated the presence of streptococcus, acinetobacter lwoffii, and clostridium tetani in various compost samples. the presence of a. lwoffii in those compost samples was confirmed by pcr using primers specific for the organism. the aim of this study was to develop a molecular tool that would allow screening for the presence or absence of different microorganisms within compost samples.

TI  == bacteremia in cirrhotic patients submitted to endoscopic band ligation of esophageal varices.
AB  == background: endoscopic procedures can develop bacteremia. patients with chronic liver disease are more predisposed to undergo bacteremia and infections because they are immunocompromised. aims: the purpose of this study was to determine the  incidence of bacteremia in cirrhotics submitted to endoscopic variceal ligation.  methods: three groups of 40 patients each were studied. one group was made up of  patients with cirrhosis who were submitted to ligation, a second group was composed of cirrhotics who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy only, and a third group was composed of patients without liver disease who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. blood was sampled from all patients for culture, both in aerobic and in anaerobic mediums, immediately before endoscopy and at 5 and 30 minutes after its completion. results: blood culture was positive in 6 samples. in 4 of these, the bacteria (staphylococcus hominis hominis, staphylococcus auricularis, acinetobacter lwoffii, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus) were isolated before the endoscopic procedure and thus were considered as contamination. in the ligation group, a streptococcus of the viridans group was isolated 5 minutes after the procedure, and in the cirrhosis without ligation group, a staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated at 30 minutes. none of the patients showed clinical evidence of infection. conclusions: the bacteremia incidence in cirrhotic patients submitted to variceal ligation was 2.5%, showing  no difference from the control groups.

TI  == antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil and methanol extracts of achillea millefolium subsp. millefolium afan. (asteraceae).
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the essential oil and methanol extracts of achillea millefolium subsp. millefolium afan. (asteraceae) were investigated. gc-ms analysis of the essential oil resulted in the identification of 36 compounds constituting 90.8% of the total oil. eucalyptol, camphor, alpha-terpineol, beta-pinene, and borneol were the principal components  comprising 60.7% of the oil. the oil strongly reduced the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl  radical (ic(50)=1.56 micro g/ml) and exhibited hydroxyl radical scavenging effect in the fe(3+)-edta-h(2)o(2) deoxyribose system (ic(50)=2.7 micro g/ml). it also inhibited the nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation of rat liver homogenate (ic(50)=13.5 micro g/ml). the polar phase of the extract showed antioxidant activity. the oil showed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, mycobacterium smegmatis, acinetobacter lwoffii and candida krusei while water-insoluble parts of the methanolic extracts exhibited slight or no activity. this study confirms that the essential oil of achillea millefolium possesses antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in vitro.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == cefdinir (fk482), an orally administered cephalosporin in vitro activity comparison against recent clinical isolates from five medical centers and determination of mic quality control guidelines.
AB  == cefdinir, a new oral cephalosporin, was compared to cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefixime, and cefuroxime against greater than 5000 recent aerobic clinical isolates. this multicenter study revealed broad-spectrum cefdinir activity against all enterobacteriaceae (mic50s, 0.06-2 micrograms/ml) except enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens (mic50s,  greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90s, 0.5-2 micrograms/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococcus group b (mic90, 0.06  micrograms/ml), and acinetobacter lwoffii were also susceptible to cefdinir. the  activity of cefdinir was similar to that of cefixime and cefuroxime against gram-negative organisms and superior to all tested oral cephems when tested against gram-positive cocci. none of the cephalosporins were active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., enterococci, pseudomonas spp., or xanthomonas maltophilia. mic quality control range guidelines were established for the strains recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards documents.

TI  == [a clinical evaluation of sultamicillin fine granules in the treatment of meibomianitis].
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and the safety of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules in the treatment of patients with meibomianitis. a dose of 375 mg sbtpc granules was orally given to 10 patients with meibomianitis after each meal, three times a day. the results obtained are summarized as follows. efficacies were rated as good in 7 cases, fair in 2 and poor in 1 with an efficacy ratio of 70.0%. no side effects were observed throughout the study. the organisms isolated were gram-positive bacteria such as  staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase negative staphylococcus and streptococcus sanguis, and gram-negative bacteria such as alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, alcaligenes denitrificans subsp.  xylosoxidans, xanthomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter lwoffii. a bacteriological study showed lower mics of sbtpc than those of ampicillin (abpc), suggesting that sbtpc has more potent antibacterial activity than abpc. such bacteriological activity of sbtpc was well reflected in its clinical efficacy; the drug was effective in patients with infections caused by organisms moderately or highly resistant to abpc or cefaclor.
