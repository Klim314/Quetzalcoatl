TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  - Phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% EDTA, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% NaOCl were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces meyeri, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. The cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. With regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% EDTA and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. CONCLUSION: Phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).
TI  - Association between periodontal condition and subgingival microbiota in women during pregnancy: a longitudinal study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, the gingival conditions and the quantitative detection  for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia in pregnant women were determined. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Quantitative determinations of periodontal bacteria by using a SyBr green system in women during pregnancy were performed. Women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and non-pregnant women were included in this study. A. actinomycetemcomitans was observed in high numbers in women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy with a significant difference (p<0.05). F. nucleatum and P. intermedia were also observed in high levels. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our results show that pregnant women are more susceptible to gingivitis, and the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival biofilm might be taken into account for the treatment of periodontal disease.
TI  - Microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  - Nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. The aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. Twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. All the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (Control). All the interventions had a duration of 30 days. The DNA checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. The supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). The total genome counts from the Control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). After 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Other major periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels. The toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. Chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. Chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis.
AB  - AIM: To characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. METHODOLOGY: Apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the Kyushu University Hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. DNA was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and specific fimA genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with specific primers. RESULTS: Bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were P. gingivalis (19.9%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and Propionibacterium acnes (9%). Bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. In addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT-113, Olsenella uli, Slackia exigua, Selemonas infelix, P. gingivalis with type IV fimA, and a combination of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcaceae sp. HOT-113 and predominance of Streptococcus spp. On the other hand, neither Enterococcus faecalis nor C. albicans were detected in any of the samples. CONCLUSION: Whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. The diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.
TI  - Effects of stress hormones on the production of volatile sulfur compounds by periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Little is known about the effects of stress hormones on the etiologic agents of halitosis. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the effects of adrenaline (ADR), noradrenaline (NA) and cortisol (CORT) on bacteria that produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), the major gases responsible for bad breath. Cultures of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Porphyromonas endodontalis (Pe), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) were exposed to 50 microM ADR, NA and CORT or equivalent volumes of sterile water as controls for 12 and 24 h. Growth was evaluated based on absorbance at 660 nm. Portable gas chromatography was used to measure VSC concentrations. Kruskal-Wallis and the Dunn post-hoc test were used to compare the groups. For Fn, ADR, NA and CORT significantly reduced bacterial growth after 12 h and 24 h (p<0.05). All the substances tested increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production (p<0.05). For Pe, all the substances tested reduced bacterial development after 24 h (p<0.05), and NA significantly increased the H2S concentration after 12 h (p<0.05). In the Pg and Pi cultures, no effects on bacterial growth were observed (p>0.05). In the Pi cultures, ADR, NA and CORT increased H2S (p<0.05). Catecholamines and cortisol can interfere with growth and H2S production of sub-gingival species in vitro. This process appears to be complex and supports the association between stress and the production of VSC.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of necrotic pulp and fistulae in primary teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Primary teeth work as guides for the eruption of permanent dentition, contribute for the development of the jaws, chewing process, preparing food for digestion, and nutrient assimilation. Treatment of pulp necrosis in primary teeth is complex due to anatomical and physiological characteristics and high number of bacterial species present in endodontic infections. The bacterial presence alone or in association in necrotic pulp and fistula samples from primary teeth of boys and girls was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Necrotic pulp (103) and fistula (7) samples from deciduous teeth with deep caries of 110 children were evaluated. Bacterial morphotypes and species from all clinical samples were determined. RESULTS: A predominance of gram-positive cocci (81.8%) and gram-negative coccobacilli (49.1%) was observed. In 88 out of 103 pulp samples, a high prevalence of Enterococcus spp. (50%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (49%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (25%) and Prevotella nigrescens (11.4%) was observed. Porphyromonas gingivalis was detected in three out of seven fistula samples, Enterococcus spp. in two out of seven samples, and F. nucleatum, P. nigrescens and D. pneumosintes in one out of seven samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Enterococcus spp. and P. gingivalis were prevalent in necrotic pulp from deciduous teeth in boys from 2 to 5 years old, and that care of the oral cavity of children up to five years of age is important.
TI  - Dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  - AIM: We aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (BS) and non-discoloured plaque. METHODS: Forty-six children with BS and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. Dental caries was scored using WHO criteria. Samples of BS and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. The DNA of the samples was extracted and real-time PCR was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus sp., Actinomyces naeslundii, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. RESULTS: Children with BS had lower DMFT (p = 0.013), lower DT values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. Plaque samples of the BS group contained higher numbers of A. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of F. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and Lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. Comparing the children with BS and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for A. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with BS while in caries-affected children with BS, lower counts of F. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. Counts of Lactobacillus sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in BS of caries-free and caries-affected children. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the different microbial composition of BS might be associated with the lower caries experience in affected subjects. The role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of salivary periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in patients before dental implant treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Periodontal pathogens in dental plaque are the main causative agents of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. Detection of the presence of such periodontal pathogens early would serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the periodontal pathogen levels in saliva were correlated with the periodontal status of patients receiving implant treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 291 patients visiting Tokyo Dental College Chiba Hospital were divided into four groups: a no-periodontitis (np) group, a mild-periodontitis (mip) group, a moderate-periodontitis (mop) group, and a severe-periodontitis (sp) group. The levels of the following five periodontal pathogens in saliva were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia. RESULTS: The levels of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were significantly higher in mop group than in np group (P < 0.05). The levels of all periodontal pathogens tested except A. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in sp group than in np group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The detection levels of the periodontal pathogens targeted in saliva samples were correlated with the periodontal status. This suggests that using saliva to screen for periodontopathic bacteria offers an easier-to-use clinical tool than the paper point method in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.
TI  - Periodontopathogen and Epstein-Barr virus-associated periapical periodontitis may be the source of retrograde infectious peri-implantitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a role in periodontitis and  peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. Periapical periodontitis (PP) lesions can predict future apical peri-implantitis complications. PURPOSE: This pilot study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial coinfection in symptomatic (SP) and asymptomatic (AP) PP and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination in patients receiving implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based identification was performed on PP granulation tissue (GT) from 33 SP and AP patients and compared with unstimulated whole saliva. Quantitative PCR evaluated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus copy counts. RESULTS: SP GT had higher proportions of periodontopathogens. Symptomatic patients were 3.7 times more likely to be infected with EBV than AP (p = .07; 95% CI: 0.8-16.2). SP were 2.9, 2.1, 3.6, and 1.6 times more likely to be infected with Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. The odds ratio of EBV infecting PP lesions was two times higher in those positive for the virus in saliva. Saliva Tannerella forsythia-positive patients were 15 times more likely to present this pathogen in PP lesions (p = .038). Saliva EBV-positive individuals were 7 and 3.5 times more likely to yield GT contamination with T. forsythia and T. denticola, respectively. EBV copy counts were significantly higher in SP (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: A causal association between EBV, specific bacterial anaerobic infection, and symptomatic PP is likely. EBV high prevalence underscores the viral etiological importance. Salivary EBV contamination is likely to be associated with viral and bacterial GT infection. Saliva PCR analysis can be a good predictor of GT specific infection and help establish antimicrobial therapy. If confirmed by prospective longitudinal clinical trials, antiviral therapy could possibly benefit SP and nonresponsive to treatment individuals and help prevent potential peri-implant infectious complications.
TI  - Frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. DESIGN OF STUDY: The presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). RESULTS: The pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). Except for P. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). The frequency of P.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). In periodontal samples, T. forsythia and T. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). The frequencies of C. rectus and T. forsythia were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). The frequency of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. There was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.
TI  - Reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. Salivary arginase activity (SAA) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. Therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the SAA before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. Plaque and Gingival Indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. The presence of Campylobacter rectus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. Salivary total protein level and SAA were also established by spectrophotometry. Clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon, Mann-Withney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests (P < .05). For microbial data, the chi-square test was used. The Pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. RESULTS: After therapy, due to a significant reduction in SAA, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found in the healthy group. Interestingly, after therapy, SAA followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group T forsythia, pre- > posttherapy; periodontitis group P. gingivalis, T. denticola, P. intermedia, and T. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). CONCLUSION: Based on the reduction of SAA after therapy, in accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters, it was concluded that SAA has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota from Cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  - This present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the Cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the Tufted Capuchin Monkey Procreation Center (Sao Paulo State University - UNESP) or free-ranging monkeys. For this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. The primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to VMGA III transport medium and ultrapure water. The microbiota was cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial DNA was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using PCR and real-time PCR. The actinomycetes, fusobacteria, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic rods, Tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Dialister pneumosintes and Prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas Treponema denticola was not found. Populations of C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.
TI  - The short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. Bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: No halitosis (identified by VSC assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. At day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Tannerella forsythia. A decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: P. gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, S. aureus, and Treponema denticola. Baseline VSC scores were correlated with several bacterial species. The use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of VSC compared to rinsing alone. CONCLUSIONS: VSC scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. The active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. Tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.
TI  - Impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (RP) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [GR]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) analysis. METHODS: Individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or >3 sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GR (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >/=2.5 mm after treatment. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM analysis. Significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. Species that increased or persisted in high frequency in RP but were significantly reduced in GR included Bacteroidetes sp., Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Tannerella forsythia, Dialister spp., Selenomonas spp., Catonella morbi, Eubacterium spp., Filifactor alocis, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus sp. OT113, Fusobacterium sp. OT203, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Streptococcus intermedius or Streptococcus constellatus, and Shuttlesworthia satelles. In contrast, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Gemella haemolysans, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Kingella oralis, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, Rothia dentocariosa, Streptococcus australis, and Veillonella spp. were more associated with therapeutic success. CONCLUSION: Persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.
TI  - Detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  - We report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. The bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). P. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. However, T. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by T. denticola. Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia, Eikenella corrodens, and Parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. This suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. There was also a strong relation between T. denticola and T. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related T. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related T. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. Overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium T. forsythia.
TI  - RNA-oligonucleotide quantification technique (ROQT) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  - Approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. The aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. Oligonucleotides targeting the 16S ribosomal DNA gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. These probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. Target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as TM7 sp. OT 346, Mitsuokella sp. OT 131 and Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041. Sensitivity and specificity of the probes were determined. A Universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. Sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. Chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a CCD camera. In a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. Probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. Fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and Actinomyces gerencseriae were the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. Among uncultivated/unrecognized species, Mitsuokella sp. OT 131 and Prevotella sp. OT 306 were the most numerous. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. Direct hybridization of total nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - The effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. Microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. Periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. The dogs were randomly treated with aPDT using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (SRP), or with the association of treatments (SRP + aPDT). Plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were determined using DNA-DNA hybridization. Gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1), interleukin (IL) 6, IL-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 S rRNA gene were evaluated through real-time PCR. The results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of Prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), Prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and Tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for aPDT and SRP + aPDT. After 4 weeks, a regrowth of Porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00) and Treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. Also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the aPDT (p = 0.00). For the cytokine pattern, the results were similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. Our results suggest that SRP, aPDT in a single application, and SRP + aPDT affects different bacterial species and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.
TI  - Detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  - To culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. Micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus (HAIN Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) tests are two commercially available rapid PCR-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. In this study, we compared these commercial PCR-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. A total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. Aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. The overall agreement between both methods was excellent for Eubacterium nodatum, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for Capnocytophaga sp, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra (Micromonas micros), and Campylobacter rectus (86-78%). Discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i P. intermedia/Prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. Nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Clinical status and detection of periodontopathogens and Streptococcus mutans in  children with high levels of supragingival biofilm.
AB  - Knowledge about the presence of some important oral pathogens is an important step in better identifying children at risk for periodontal and/or caries diseases in later life. The purpose of this study was to detect the presence of Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), and Tannerella forsythia (Tf) in gingival biofilm samples from 196 children, and to assess whether any of these pathogens are more associated with gingival inflammation extension and the Decayed/Missing/Filled teeth (DMFT/dmft) index. The subjects presented plaque index greater than 80% and were divided in 3 groups according to the bleeding index (BI): I) Low bleeding (< 30%), II) Medium bleeding (31 - 59%) and III) High bleeding (> 60%). The presence of each pathogen was determined by PCR. The prevalence of Sm was 71.9% and the mean dmft/DMFT was 6.68. The prevalence in low, medium and high bleeding groups was 43.5%, 34.5% and 46.7% for Aa; 43.5%, 37.9%, and 36.7% for Cr; 99.1%, 100%, and 96.7% for Pg; 56.5%, 56.9%, and 66.7% for Pi; and 58.3%, 60.3%, and 56.7% for Tf, respectively. Pg (99.0%) was the most prevalent periodontal pathogen detected followed by Tf (58.7%), Pi (58.2%), Aa (41.3%) and Cr (40.8%). Our study indicated that in this high plaque index population studied, a high prevalence of Sm and high mean DMFT were observed. In addition, the presence of Pi was associated with the presence of inflammation (P < 0.05) whereas Cr was associated with periodontal health (P < 0.05).
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  - Oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. In this study, the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time PCR. Forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. Approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and DNA was obtained. Quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific TaqMan probe/primer sets. Total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial DNA were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. All periodontal bacteria except for the F. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their DNA represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial DNA obtained from periodontitis patients. Porphyromonas gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia were detected most often. The presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. In addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial DNA could be observed. The significant number of periodontopathic bacterial DNA species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.
TI  - Microbiological profile of untreated subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - AIM: The microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) has not yet been determined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of LAgP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty subjects with LAgP (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP, n=25), chronic periodontitis (ChP, n=30) or periodontal health (PH, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. Nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Red complex and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in LAgP. The proportions of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of LAgP subjects in comparison with those with GAgP or ChP, but not in deep sites. This species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens. The host-compatible Actinomyces species were reduced in LAgP. CONCLUSION: A. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of LAgP, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum and Prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. Successful treatment of LAgP would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the Actinomyces species.
TI  - Detection of herpesviruses and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis, or gingivitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpesviruses may be related to the etiology of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) by triggering periodontal destruction or by increasing the risk for bacterial infection. This case-control study evaluated the presence of herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus type I (EBV-1), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) in patients with generalized AgP (AgP group), CP (CP group), or gingivitis (G group) and in healthy individuals (C group). METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected with paper points from 30 patients in each group. The nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect HSV-1, EBV-1, and HCMV. Bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA-based PCR. RESULTS: HSV-1, HCMV, and EBV-1 were detected in 86.7%, 46.7%, and 33.3% of the AgP group, respectively; in 40.0%, 50.0%, and 46.7% of the CP group, respectively; in 53.3%, 40.0%, and 20.0% of the G group, respectively; and in 20.0%, 56.7%, and 0.0% of the C group, respectively. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected significantly more often in the AgP group compared to the other groups (P <0.005). P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were identified more frequently in AgP and CP groups, and AgP, CP, and G groups had higher frequencies of P. intermedia compared to the C group. CONCLUSION: In Brazilian patients, HSV-1 and EBV-1, rather than HCMV, were more frequently associated with CP and AgP.
TI  - Frequency, microbial interactions, and antimicrobial susceptibility of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum isolated from primary endodontic infections.
AB  - This study assessed the prevalence and microbial interactions of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium necrophorum in primary endodontic infections from a Brazilian population and their antimicrobial susceptibility to some antibiotics by the E-test. One hundred ten samples from infected teeth with periapical pathologies were analyzed by culture methods. Five hundred eighty individual strains were isolated; 81.4% were strict anaerobes. F. nucleatum was found in 38 root canals and was associated with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., and Eubacterium spp. F. necrophorum was found in 20 root canals and was associated with Peptostreptococcus prevotii. The simultaneous presence of F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum was not related to endodontic symptoms (p > 0.05). They were 100% susceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and cephaclor. Fusobacterium spp. is frequently isolated from primary-infected root canals of teeth with periapical pathologies. Amoxicillin is a useful antibiotic against F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum in endodontic infections and has been prescribed as the first choice in Brazil.
TI  - Detection of periodontal pathogens in oral mucous membranes of edentulous individuals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the colonization of Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) in the tongue and cheek of newborns and elderly individuals with no teeth. METHODS: Seventy-four edentulous subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. Microbiologic samples were taken from the dorsum of the tongue and cheek mucosa of all individuals and analyzed using a bacterial DNA-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: C. rectus was the most prevalent species in both groups (20.9% in the cheek of newborns, and 77.4% in the tongue of elderly subjects). P. gingivalis and P. intermedia were not detected in any of the 43 newborns; however, P. gingivalis was recovered from the tongue and cheek (3.2%) of elderly individuals, whereas P. intermedia was detected in the tongue (9.6%) and cheek (3.2%) of elderly individuals. T. forsythia was detected in newborns as well as elderly individuals, although the highest prevalence was observed in the tongue of newborns (6.9%) and elderly (9.6%) individuals. A. actinomycetemcomitans was not found in the tongue of newborns, but we observed A. actinomycetemcomitans in the cheek (2.3%) of newborns and in the tongue (12.9%) and cheek (6.4%) of elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although we did not detect P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in newborns, periodontal pathogens could be detected from the oral mucous membranes of edentulous individuals. Our results suggest that major attention should be paid to edentulous individuals as an important measure in the prevention of the initial colonization of natural teeth and dental implants by periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect and pH of chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide alone and  associated with other materials.
AB  - The purposes of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate gel, calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] and their combination with iodoform and zinc oxide powder as intracanal medications against select microorganisms, and to measure the pH changes caused by these medications. Antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. The zones of growth inhibition were measured and the results were analyzed statistically by Kruskal-Wallis test (p<0.05). The pH of the pastes was measured right after preparation, after 24 h and 1 week later. The largest mean zones of microbial inhibition were produced by 2% CHX gel, followed by Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel + iodoform, Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel, Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel + zinc oxide, and Ca(OH)2 + water. The mean pH of all medications stayed above 12.0 during the whole experiment, except for CHX gel (pH=7.0). The results of this study showed that all medications had antimicrobial activity, but the most effective against the tested microorganisms were 2% CHX gel, followed by its combination with Ca(OH)2 and iodoform.
TI  - Microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. DNA was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. A PCR assay using species-specific primers of 16S rDNA and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by Peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. Moreover, PCR detected Filifactor alocis in 26.7%, Treponema denticola in 24.4%, and Tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. T. denticola and P. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). P. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). P. endodontalis and P. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). Synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. The results of this study indicated that E. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by PCR in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.
TI  - Comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. The antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. The growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by NaOCl and chlorhexidine solution. The largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all NaOCl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). However, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. The results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria isolated from pus specimens from orofacial infections.
AB  - Most suppurative orofacial infections are polymicrobial. Information regarding the antimicrobial susceptibility of the microorganisms involved can be useful in the choice of an effective antibiotic therapy. In this study we determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of a total 235 anaerobic and aerobic bacteria recently isolated from pus specimens of orofacial infections. All the viridans streptococci were susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, imipenem and levofloxacin. Imipenem and levofloxacin were active against 100% of the anaerobic Gram-positive organisms isolated. Among the anaerobic Gram-negative rods beta-lactamase production was detected in all species except Campylobacter rectus. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole were active against all the isolates of anaerobic Gram-negative species. Isolates resistant to erythromycin were found in all the species tested, however, resistance to clindamycin was only detected in Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Isolates resistant to levofloxacin were detected in P. gingivalis and Prevotella sp.
TI  - Implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. Twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. Before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. After implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. Periodontal pathogens such as Aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. Surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. Foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. Although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.
TI  - Bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. We investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the Buffalo, New York Women's Health Initiative Observational Study was conducted. Standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ACH). Subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. RESULTS: The most prevalent infection was Streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by Prevotella intermedia (43.4%), Tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), Capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), Eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), Campylobacter rectus (17.4%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). Infections with P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, P. intermedia, and C. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ACH, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. The body mass index (BMI) was a modifier of this association. Overweight women with T. forsythensis infection were more likely to have oral bone loss (OR = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.08 to 5.46) than normal weight (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.72 to 2.20) women with T. forsythensis infection. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal women. Those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. Further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of BMI and/or inflammatory factors.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  - Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. Nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the Ribosomal Database Project II database. Phylotypes from 37 genera representing Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were identified. Results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythensis and Treponema denticola. Since members of the domain Archaea have been implicated in the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16S archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. A Methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. DNA from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. Trep. denticola was detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. Conversely, Porph. endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. All other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers in both patients. These results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic infections associated with clinical symptoms.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine gel used as intracanal medicament.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) combined with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) gel against endodontic pathogens and to compare the results with the ones achieved by Ca(OH)2 mixed with sterile water and by CHX gel alone. Two methods were used: the agar diffusion test and the direct contact test. Ca(OH)2 + 2% CHX gel produced inhibitory zones ranging from 2.84 to 6.5 mm, and required from 30 seconds to 6 hours to eliminate all tested microorganisms. However, 2% CHX gel showed the largest microbial growth zones from 4.33 to 21.67 mm, and required 1 minute or less to inhibit all tested microorganisms. A paste of Ca(OH)2 plus sterile water inhibited only the microorganisms with which it was in direct contact and required from 30 seconds to 24 hours to kill all tested microorganisms. In conclusion, 2% CHX gel + Ca(OH)2 showed better antimicrobial activity than Ca(OH)2 manipulated with sterile water.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the susceptibility of endodontic pathogens to calcium hydroxide combined with different vehicles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] in combination with different vehicles against endodontic pathogens. For such purpose, a broth dilution test was performed. Pastes were prepared with Ca(OH)2 powder and the following vehicles: sterile water, glycerin, camphorated monochlorophenol (CMCP), CMCP + glycerin, polyethyleneglycol and CMCP + polyethyleneglycol. The time required for the pastes to produce negative cultures against the tested microorganisms was recorded and analyzed statistically using the Kruskal Wallis test at 5% significance level. Timing for pastes to eliminate the aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms ranged from 6 to 24 h, while strict anaerobic microorganisms were inhibited within 30 s to 5 min. Microbial susceptibility, ranked from weakest to strongest, can be presented as follows: Enterococcus faecalis (the most resistant microorganism), Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis and Prevotella intermedia (the last two microorganisms required the same time to be eliminated). In conclusion, calcium hydroxide pastes needed more time to eliminate facultative than anaerobic microorganisms. These findings suggest that the antimicrobial property is related both to paste formulation and to microbial susceptibility.
TI  - Comparative study between the effects of photodynamic therapy and conventional therapy on microbial reduction in ligature-induced peri-implantitis in dogs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Progressive peri-implant bone losses, which are accompanied by inflammatory lesions in the soft tissues, are referred to as peri-implantitis. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and conventional technique on microbial reduction in ligature-induced peri-implantitis in dogs. METHODS: Eighteen third premolars from nine Labrador retriever dogs were extracted and the implants were submerged. After osseointegration, peri-implantitis was induced. After 4 months, ligature was removed and natural bacterial plaque was allowed to form for another 4 months. The animals were then randomly divided into two groups. In the conventional group, they were treated using mucoperiosteal flaps for scaling the implant surface and chlorexidine (conventional) irrigation. In the PDT group, only mucoperiosteal scaling was carried out before photodynamic therapy. Inside the peri-implant pocket, a paste-based azulene photosensitizer was placed and then a GaAlAs low-power laser (lambda=660 nm, P=40 mW, E=7.2 J for 3 minutes) was used. Microbiological samples were obtained before and immediately after treatment. Before treatment, one implant was removed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy to validate the contamination. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that Prevotella sp., Fusobacterium sp., and S. Beta-haemolyticus were significantly reduced for both groups. After treatment, no significant differences were observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that photodynamic therapy is a non-invasive method that could be used to reduce microorganisms in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a Chilean population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (AgP). Other periodontopathic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in Chilean patients with AgP. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. Samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (CP) patients were taken as controls. Samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (RTF) and cultured. Periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. The identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: AgP showed a significatively higher prevalence of C. rectus than CP (P = 0.036). The only statistical difference found was for C. rectus. Patients with AgP showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. A similar prevalence in both groups of patients was observed for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia/nigrescens, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in AgP than CP patients. In localized AgP, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, and P. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized AgP patients who harbored A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: C. rectus, P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of AgP in this Chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between AgP and CP was for C. rectus, suggesting that the differences in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. In this study, the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens in endodontic lesions detected by culture and by PCR.
AB  - he aim of this study was to investigate the presence of four black-pigmented bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens, in endodontic infections by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Microbial samples were obtained from 50 teeth with untreated necrotic pulps (primary infection) and from 50 teeth with failing endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Microbiological strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation, and identification. For PCR detection, the samples were analyzed using species-specific primers of 16S rDNA and the downstream intergenic spacer region. Culture and PCR detected the test species in 13/100 and 50/100 of the study teeth, respectively. The organisms were cultured from 11/50 (22%) of primarily infected root canal samples and from 2/50 (4%) of secondary root canal samples. PCR detection identified the target species in 32/50 (64%) and 18/50 (36%) of primary and secondary infections, respectively. P. gingivalis was rarely isolated by culture methods (1%), but was the most frequently identified test species by PCR (38%). Similarly, P. endodontalis was not recovered by culture from any tooth studied, but was detected by PCR in 25% of the sampled teeth. PCR-based identification also showed higher detection rates of P. intermedia (33%) and P. nigrescens (22%) than culture (13%). In conclusion, P. gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. intermedia, and P. nigrescens were identified more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment. Also, a higher frequency of black-pigmented species was detected by PCR than by culture.
TI  - Microbiological basis of oral infections and sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  - Because oral infections are common, the physician must understand the underlying  etiology, pathogeny, and other variables that determine how these processes evolve in order to choose the most appropriate antibiotic drug. The special characteristics of the oral cavity determine the make-up of the microflora that lives there. Different anaerobic species belonging to the Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Gemella, and Porphyromonas genera are of particular interest, as are the aerobic species Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium. Each of these microorganisms occupies a different microniche within the oral cavity, and the prevailing balance is upset when conditions become modified as a result of illness or due to dental interventions such as tooth extraction or tooth scaling and polishing. Pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria (Actinomyces, Prevotella intermedia species, etc.) can develop in these conditions, as can yeasts (Candida sp., Histoplasma capsulatum), virus (herpes simplex, papilomavirus), and parasites (Entamoeba gingivalis, Trichomonas tenax). When infection occurs, the patients s immune system reacts by means of inborn immunity (non-specific) and acquired immunity (specific). Empirical treatment is administered that should be based on etiological data and on the antimicrobial sensitivity of the pathogen that is causing the infection. However, oral microflora sensitivity to different antibiotics is currently declining and there is a noticeable trend towards resistances. As a consequence of all this, the treatment of oral infections must also aim to restore the ecological balance of the oral cavity and to minimize the emergence of resistance in the microorganisms present in the mouth. Hence, epidemiological oral pathogen sensitivity studies must be conducted, fostering the administration of appropriate antibiotics at proper doses and keeping specialists abreast of the latest trends. In recent decades, oral infections comprise one of the most common pathologies in the general population, due in large part to infectious complications associated with poor oral hygiene. This in turn, translates into an increased need and demand for dental care, while at the same time, it requires that the professional accurately understand the etiological factors involved, as well as the pathogeny and different variables that determine the specificity of these kinds of infections, so as to be able to choose the appropriate antimicrobial drugs for proper treatment.
TI  - Relationship of subgingival and salivary microbiota to gingival overgrowth in heart transplant patients following cyclosporin A therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe gingival overgrowth (GO) is induced in patients taking cyclosporin A (CsA) following organ transplantation. Determining which patient will develop GO is still not possible. The purpose of this study was to establish an association between CsA and gingival overgrowth in heart transplant patients taking into account periodontal and microbiological conditions. METHODS: Thirty patients (10 female, 20 male; range: 13 to 67 years; mean age: 44.89) undergoing CsA treatment were evaluated using the gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Subgingival samples collected from the deepest site of each quadrant and saliva samples were submitted to microbial analysis. All patients had at least 12 teeth. Exclusion criteria were the use of antibiotics and/or having undergone periodontal treatment 6 months prior to the study. Patients were divided in two groups: with gingival (GO+) and without gingival overgrowth (GO-). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the GO+ and GO- groups when CsA dosage, time since transplant, GI, PI, PD, and CAL were compared. Microbiological examination of the subgingival samples detected the following microorganisms: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (36%), Prevotella intermedia (93%), Fusobacterium sp. (66%), Campylobacter rectus (30%), Micromonas micros (66%), enteric rods (0%), and yeasts (30%). A positive association between M. micros and the GO+ group was found (P < 0.001). Yeasts were detected in 30% of the subgingival and saliva samples. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical parameters were not sufficient to determine which patients would develop GO. However, colonization by M. micros might play a role in the etiology of GO.
TI  - Microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. RESULTS: A total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. Of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. The anaerobes most frequently isolated were: Peptostreptococcus micros (35%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). The root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. On the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. Suggested relationships were found between anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (P<0.05). In particular, associations were found between: a) pain (n=29) and P. micros (P<0.01), P. intermedia/nigrescens and Eubacterium spp. (both P<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and P. micros (P<0.01) Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and Porphyromonas spp. (P<0.01), Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P<0.01), Porphyromonas and Enterococcus spp. (P<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., P. micros, F. necrophorum (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. They also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.
TI  - Gingival crevice microbiota from Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in Eastern China. Samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. The analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (Fusobacterium nucleatum/Fusobacterium periodonticum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Capnocytophaga sp.), Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces gerencseriae were much more prevalent in the NUG group. Quantitatively, most taxa, including P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. Only P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, S. sputigena, A. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the NUG group. The present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in NUG-associated plaque are of prime importance.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of 0.2%, 1%, and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX gel and CHX liquid), against endodontic pathogens and compare the results with the ones achieved by 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 4%, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). A broth dilution test was performed, and the timing for irrigants to kill microbial cells was recorded and statistically analyzed. Both 2.0% gel and liquid formulations eliminated Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans in 15 seconds, whereas the gel formulation killed Enterococcus faecalis in 1 minute. All tested irrigants eliminated Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia in 15 seconds. The timing required for 1.0% and 2.0% CHX liquid to eliminate all microorganisms was the same required for 5.25% NaOCl. The antimicrobial action is related to type, concentration, and presentation form of the irrigants as well as the microbial susceptibility.
TI  - Distribution of periodontal pathogens in Korean aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial associations in aggressive periodontitis versus different ethnic origins are substantially unknown. We undertook this study to determine the prevalence of seven putative periodontopathogens in Korean patients and to evaluate microbial differences in localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. METHODS: Thirty-nine aggressive periodontitis patients between 20 and 35 years old (24 males and 15 females; mean age 29.6 years) were selected according to clinical criteria. The patients were subclassified into 17 localized and 22 generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. In each of the 39 individuals, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four diseased teeth (> or = 6 mm probing depth, 156 sites) and one healthy site (< or = 3 mm probing depth, 39 sites). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragments (about 530 bp) of plaque bacteria and their subsequent detection by dot-blot hybridization using specific oligonucleotide probes were performed to determine the presence of seven periodontopathogens. RESULTS: The prevalences were 75% for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 94.2% for Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus), 99.4% for Fusobacterium sp., 85.9% for Micromonas micros (formerly Peptostreptococcus micros), 96.8% for Porphyromonas gingivalis, 78.8% for Prevotella intermedia, and 96.8% for Treponema sp. The prevalences of these bacteria were significantly higher in diseased sites than in healthy sites. Logistic regression analysis showed that P. intermedia was more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis than the localized form, with an odds ratio of 3.28 (95% confidence interval 1.26-8.56, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the seven periodontal pathogens analyzed are strongly associated with Korean aggressive periodontitis. In particular, P. intermedia are more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis, a more severe and progressive form, than with localized aggressive periodontitis.
TI  - Effects of triclosan-containing rinse on the dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro plaque ecosystems.
AB  - Dental plaque microcosms were established under a feast-famine regimen within constant-depth film fermentors and exposed four times daily postfeeding to a triclosan (TR)-containing rinse (dentifrice) (TRD). This was diluted so that the antimicrobial content was 0.6 mg/ml. Microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with primers specific for the V2-V3 region of the eubacterial 16S rRNA gene (rDNA). Dominant isolates and PCR amplicons were identified by partial sequencing of 16S rDNA. TRD caused considerable decreases in the counts of both gram-negative organisms and total anaerobic cells, transiently lowered the numbers of streptococci and actinomycetes, and markedly increased the proportion of lactobacilli. DGGE indicated the presence of putatively unculturable bacteria and showed that a Porphyromonas sp. and Selenomonas infelix had been inhibited by TRD. Pure culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Neisseria subflava, Prevotella nigrescens, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were highly susceptible to TR, while the lactobacilli and streptococci were the least susceptible. Clonal expansion of the lactobacilli in the pulsed microcosm could be explained on the basis of TR activity. The mean MICs of TR, chlorhexidine, erythromycin, penicillin V, and vancomycin for the population before and after 5 days of exposure to TRD showed few significant changes. In conclusion, changes in plaque microcosm populations following repeated exposure to TRD showed inhibition of the most susceptible flora and clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Althaea officinalis L. roots, Arnica montana L. flowers, Calendula officinalis L. flowers, Hamamelis virginiana L. leaves, Illicium verum Hook. fruits and Melissa officinalis L. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veilonella parvula, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros and Actinomyces odontolyticus. The methanol extracts of H. virginiana and A. montana and, to a lesser extent, A. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (MIC < or = 2048 mg/L) against many of the species tested. In comparison, M. officinalis and C. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (MIC > or = 2048 mg/L) against all the tested species with the exception of Prevotella sp. Illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against E. corrodens. The results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of H. virginiana, A. montana and A. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.
TI  - Lethal photosensitization in microbiological treatment of ligature-induced peri-implantitis: a preliminary study in dogs.
AB  - This pilot study evaluated, by culture testing, the effectiveness of lethal photosensitization for the microbiological treatment of peri-implantitis in dogs. Experimental peri-implantitis was induced by ligature placement for 2 months. Following ligature removal, plaque control was instituted by scrubbing with 0.12% chlorhexidine daily for 12 months. Subsequently, mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated for scaling the implant surface. Microbial samples were obtained with paper points before and after treatment of implant surfaces by means of 100 microg/ml toluidine blue O (TBO,) and were exposed, for 80 s, to light with a wavelength of 685 nm from a 50 mW GaAlAs diode laser. The mean initial and final bacterial counts were 7.22 +/- 0.20 and 6.84 +/- 0.44 CFU/ml, respectively for TVC (P < 0.0001); 6.19 +/- 0.45 and 3.14 +/- 3.29 CFU/ml for P. intermedia/nigrescens (P = 0.001); 5.98 +/- 0.38 and 1.69 +/- 2.90 CFU/ml for Fusobacterium spp. (P = 0.001); and 6.07 +/- 0.22 to 1.69 +/- 2.94 CFU/ml for beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (P = 0.0039). It may be concluded that lethal photosensitization resulted in a reduction of the bacterial count. Complete elimination of bacteria was achieved in some samples.
TI  - Microbiologic and radiographic analysis of ligature-induced peri-implantitis with different dental implant surfaces.
AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. After 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. On days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. The presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Campylobacter spp, Capnocytophaga spp, Fusobacterium spp, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and Candida spp were evaluated culturally. RESULTS: P intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. P gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was detected in 29.03% of dental implants. Fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. Streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. Campylobacter spp and Candida spp were detected in low proportions. The total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (P = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (P < .0014). However, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. The peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (P = .908). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.
TI  - Microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. Stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. The test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. The zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. Enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic Porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedial intermedia. Ca(OH)2 + CMCP + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. We conclude that anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative Gram-positive microorganisms.
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological study of adult periodontal disease].
AB  - The aim of this study was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of sites with and without clinical evidence of moderate and severe periodontitis and their correlation with clinical parameters. A total of 52 disease sites and 10 healthy sites were selected according to clinical criteria. The following clinical indexes were measured for all the sites: plaque index, gingival index, blood on probing, depth on probing and insertion level. Samples of subgingival plaque were collected for culture and for differential counts of microbial morphotypes. In disease sites the most frequently isolated were: Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (23%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (10%) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (31%). The aerobic gram-positive microflora was predominant in healthy sites. Significant differences were observed in microbial morphotypes between healthy and disease sites: cocci 18.71% and 78.90%, motile rods 46.12% and 16.70%, total spirochetes 26.48% and 2.80%, respectively. The presence of motile rods, spirochetes and P. intermedia/nigrescens were the parameters with most sensitivity to suspect periodontal disease. There were significant differences in the subgingival microflora between healthy and disease sites in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.
TI  - Treatment of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline. Clinical, microbiological and radiological results.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical, microbiological and radiological effects of peri-implantitis therapy by local delivery of tetracycline. In 25 partially edentulous patients, 30 implants with radiographic evidence of circumferential bone loss, and peri-implant probing depths > or =5 mm were treated with polymeric tetracycline HCl-containing fibers. Clinical and microbial parameters were recorded at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (M) after treatment. Standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline, M3, and one year after treatment. Two patients were discontinued from the study after 180 days because of persisting active peri-implantitis with pus formation. The remaining subjects showed a significant decrease of mean peri-implant probing depth from 6.0 to 4.1 mm (M1, P<0.001), which was maintained over 12 months. In comparison to baseline, the bleeding tendency was significantly reduced after one month, and thereafter (P<0.001). No significant recession of the mucosal margin was noted. The radiologically determined distance from the shoulder of the implant to the bottom of the bony defect decreased slightly, but not significantly, from 5.2 to 4.9 mm. At M1, M3 and M6, mean total anaerobic cultivable bacterial counts were significantly lower than at baseline (P<0.001). A significant decrease in frequency of detection was noted for Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium sp., Bacteroides forsythus, and Campylobacter rectus (P<0.01). Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Eikenella corrodens had very low baseline frequencies that could not be significantly suppressed further. In conclusion, therapy of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline had a positive effect on clinical and microbiological parameters.
TI  - Detection of major putative periodontopathogens in Korean advanced adult periodontitis patients using a nucleic acid-based approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a Korean population so far. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in Korean patients by culture-independent methods. METHODS: A total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (AP) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. AP samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [PD]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm PD) in each patient. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. Aliquots of PCR products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. RESULTS: All diseased sites harbored Fusobacterium sp., while Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema sp., and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. In sites of periodontally healthy subjects, Fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). Treponema sp., P. gingivalis, and B. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. P. micros, P. intermedia, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy sites, respectively. The prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of Fusobacterium sp. and B. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Using highly sensitive methods relying on 16S ribosomal RNA-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with AP patients in a Korean population. With the exceptions of Fusobacterium sp. and B. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other micro-organisms in adult refractory periodontitis.
AB  - Forty-six adult periodontal patients, selected on the basis of clinical examination, and 46 adult healthy subjects were examined. The subgingival plaque samples from one inflammatory and one non-inflammatory site of each periodontal patient were studied to determine Porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other periodontal micro-organisms and to periodontal tissue destruction. The results showed Porphyromonas gingivalis as the main pathogenic micro-organism isolated in the inflammatory sites together with Bacteroides forsythus. Peptostreptococcus sp., Actinomyces sp. and Prevotella sp. were found as a normal oral flora in the healthy subjects. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus and Eikenella corrodens were detected both in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory sites of periodontal patients as well as in the healthy subjects.
TI  - Serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. Refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. Successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. Periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. Baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. Significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. Some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. On average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. Differences in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). The data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons). Serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel Neisseria sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. High levels of serum antibody to a Microbacterium lacticum-like organism, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and Haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
TI  - Distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetQ.
AB  - We tested 34 American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetQ gene using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and DNA-DNA hybridization. The identities of PCR products were confirmed by Southern blot hybridization of whole-cell DNA. Eleven of the ATCC strains were positive for tetQ, including five Bacteroides spp., five Prevotella spp. and a single isolate of Mitsuokella multiacidus. Twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical Gram-negative isolates carried the tetQ gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical Gram-positive isolates carried the tetQ gene. This is the first description of tetQ in Gram-positive species. All isolates except one Peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetQ integrated into the chromosome. The tetQ gene could be transferred from Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides distasonis into an Enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. In contrast, tetQ failed to transfer from two isolates of Prevotella intermedia, two isolates of Porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of Mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of Peptostreptococcus sp. The latter two are Gram-positive species. The PCR assay was used to screen 198 proteinase K-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. Thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the PCR assay could be of value in screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of randomly cloned and whole genomic DNA probes for the detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus.
AB  - Whole genomic and randomly-cloned DNA probes for two fastidious periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus were labeled with digoxigenin and detected by a colorimetric method. The specificity and sensitivity of the whole genomic and cloned probes were compared. The cloned probes were highly specific compared to the whole genomic probes. A significant degree of cross-reactivity with Bacteroides species, Capnocytophaga sp. and Prevotella sp. was observed with the whole genomic probes. The cloned probes were less sensitive than the whole genomic probes and required at least 10(6) target cells or a minimum of 10 ng of target DNA to be detected during hybridization. Although a ten-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with the whole genomic probes, cross-hybridization to closely related species limits their reliability in identifying target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in Chile.
AB  - The occurrence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (GJP) patients. The subgingival proportion of the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. The results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%) there were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia, E. corrodens, C. rectus, and F. nucleatum in LJP, and for P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum in GJP. The mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (P < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. Capnocytophaga sp, F. nucleatum, P. intermedia, and E. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in LJP. When taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with LJP and GJP in Chile are P. gingivalis (66% of LJP and 80% of GJP affected sites), and A. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of LJP and 50% in GJP affected sites). Different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.
TI  - Succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  - This report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. Tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. Tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. Microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. After implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly elevated. Following fixture placement, P. intermedia replaced P. melaninogenica as the predominant Black Pigmented Anaerobic Bacilli (BPAB) in the mouth. After abutment connection stage, levels of P. intermedia, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatun, Haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. Three months after bridge installations, P. intermedia and A. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. At six months after bridge installation, levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months. Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their levels correlated with gingival redness. P. intermedia, Porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. Correlation was detected between P. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum. Our studies show a transitional increase in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their levels.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of AXOL on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of AXOL was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The AXOL commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. The rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.
