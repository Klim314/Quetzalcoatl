TI  == pulp and plaque microbiotas of children with severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background and objective: bacterial invasion into pulps of primary teeth can lead to infection and premature tooth loss in children. this pilot study aimed to explore whether the microbiota of carious exposures of dental pulps resembles that of carious dentin or that of infected root canals. design: children with severe early childhood caries were studied. children were consented and extent of caries, plaque, and gingivitis measured. bacteria were sampled from carious lesion biofilms and vital carious exposures of pulps, and processed by anaerobic  culture. isolates were characterized from partial sequences of the 16s rrna gene  and identified by comparison with taxa in the human oral microbiome database (http://www.homd.org). the microbiotas of carious lesions and dental pulps were compared using univariate and multivariate approaches. results: the microbiota of cariously exposed pulps was similar in composition to that of carious lesion biofilms except that fewer species/taxa were identified from pulps. the major taxa identified belonged to the phyla firmicutes (mainly streptococci) and actinobacteria (mainly actinomyces species). actinomyces and selenomonas species  were associated with carious lesions whereas veillonella species, particularly veillonella dispar was associated with pulps. other bacteria detected in pulps included streptococcus mutans, parascardovia denticolens, bifidobacterium longum, and several lactobacillus and actinomyces species. by principal, component analysis pulp microbiotas grouped together, whereas those in caries biofilms were widely dispersed. conclusions: we conclude that the microbiota of cariously exposed vital primary pulps is composed of a subset of species associated with carious lesions. vital primary pulps had a dominant firmicutes and actinobacteria microbiota which contrasts with reports of endodontic infections which can harbor a gram-negative microbiota. the microbiota of exposed primary pulps may provide insight into bacterial species at the forefront of caries invasion in dentinal lesions that can invade into the pulp and the nature of species that need suppressing for successful pulp therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bifidobacterium spp. isolated from healthy adult koreans against cariogenic microflora.
AB  == objective: dental caries is the main common infectious disease in the human oral  cavity. streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were reported to be the most important etiological factors in human dental caries. thus, we examined the  inhibitory effects of bifidobacterium spp. cells and culture supernatants against s. mutans and s. sobrinus, including streptococcus gordonii, and aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with periodontal disease. methods: mutans streptococci or a. actinomycetemcomitans and lactic acid bacteria (lab) were mixed in 1:1 ratio and then incubated for 90 min at 37 degrees c. after the  incubation, the viability of mutans streptococci or a. actinomycetemcomitans was  determined by plate count technique. we also investigated the morphological changes of s. mutans treated with lab using scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: in vitro viability of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. gordonii, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was affected by human intestinal lab identified as bifidobacterium adolescentis spm1005 and bifidobacterium longum spm1207. especially, b. adolescentis spm1005 cells at 1.0 x 10(8) cfu had a strong growth-inhibiting effect against s. mutans and induced a 64% loss of its viability (p<0.05). in addition, swollen and disrupted s. mutans were observed after incubation with b. adolescentis spm1005. however, the culture supernatant of this strain did not show such inhibitory activity. conclusion: b. adolescentis spm1005 cells decreased the growth of s. mutans, which is a risk factor for dental caries. therefore, we suggest that this bifidobacterium strain may be a useful probiotic microorganism for prevention of dental caries that does not have adverse effects.

TI  == resistance to acidic environments of caries-associated bacteria: bifidobacterium  dentium and bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == oral bifidobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium longum, are  known to be isolated together with mutans streptococci and lactobacilli from caries lesions, suggesting that these bifidobacteriaceae are caries associated and acid resistant. this study aimed to investigate effects of acidification on b. dentium and b. longum, and to compare them with those on streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus paracasei. effects of acidification, growth ability in a complex medium at a ph of 4.0-8.0, cell viability in 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid monohydrate (mes)-koh buffer at ph 4.0, as well as stability of intracellular ph (ph(in)) at an extracellular ph of 3.5-8.0 estimated using a fluorescent dye, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate n-succinimidyl ester in mes-koh, 3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid-koh or n,n-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine-koh buffer, were investigated. b. longum grew as well as streptococcus strains over a wide ph range, whereas b. dentium grew best  in the narrow ph range around neutral. the cell viability of b. dentium decreased significantly after 2 h of acidification at a ph of 4.0, but this was significantly less than that of the streptococcus and lactobacillus species, whereas b. longum maintained almost 100% viability. the ph(in) was close to the extracellular ph at ph of 5.5-7.5 in the bifidobacterium and streptococcus strains, while at a ph of <5.0, the ph(in) was higher than the extracellular ph in all the strains, but the ph(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacterium strains was higher than that of the streptococcus strains. the high survival rate and ph(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacteria comparable to that of s. mutans in the acidic environment may account for why bifidobacteria exist as stable species in acidic caries lesions together with mutans streptococci.

TI  == bifidobacterium longum-fermented broccoli supernatant inhibited the growth of candida albicans and some pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the aim of this study is to develop a growth inhibitory material against some pathogenic microorganisms, using beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium species and certain types of vegetables which can be good substrates for the growth of the beneficial bacteria. at first, various vegetable juices were screened for the growth promotion of bifidobacterium longum etc. among the vegetables tested, broccoli (brassica oleracea l. var. botrytis l.) and cabbage (brassica oleracea l. var. capitata l.) showed excellent growth promoting activities for b. longum. secondly, the b. longum-fermented broccoli (bfb) and lactobacillus pentosus-fermented broccoli (lfb) supernatants were prepared and the growth inhibitory activities against candida albicans were determined. both of them showed dose-dependent, growth inhibitory effects, and the effect of bfb was superior to lfb. it was thought that the superior effect of bfb could be mainly attributed to the acids, especially acetic acid, produced by b. longum. bfb also inhibited some pathogenic bacteria such as streptococcus mutans and porphylomonas gingivalis. in conclusion, broccoli was found to be a good growth-promoting substance for b. longum. the fermented product, bfb, appears to  be a usable material that inhibits the growth of c. albicans and some pathogenic  bacteria.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
