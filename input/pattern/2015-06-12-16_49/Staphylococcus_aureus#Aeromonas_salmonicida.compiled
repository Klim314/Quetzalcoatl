TI  - Influence of external bacterial structures on the efficiency of photodynamic inactivation by a cationic porphyrin.
AB  - The main targets of photodynamic inactivation (PDI) are the external bacterial structures, cytoplasmic membrane and cell wall. In this work it was evaluated how the external bacterial structures influence the PDI efficiency. To reach this objective 8 bacteria with distinct external structures were selected; 4 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, with typical Gram-negative external structures; Aeromonas salmonicida, Aeromonas hydrophila both with an S-layer and Rhodopirellula sp., with a peptidoglycan-less proteinaceous cell wall and with cytoplasm compartmentalization) and 4 Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, with typical Gram-positive external structures; Truepera radiovictrix, Deinococcus geothermalis and Deinococcus radiodurans, all with thick cell walls that give them Gram-positive stains, but including a second complex multi-layered membrane and structurally analogous to that of Gram-negative bacteria). The studies were performed in the presence of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin tetraiodide (Tetra-Py(+)-Me) at 5.0 muM with white light (40 W m(-2)). The susceptibility of each bacteria to PDI by Tetra-Py(+)-Me was dependent on bacteria external structures. Although all Gram-positive bacteria were inactivated to the detection limit (reduction of approximately 8 log) after 60-180 min of irradiation, the inactivation followed distinct patterns. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli was the only species to be inactivated to the detection limit ( approximately 8 log after 180 min). The efficiency of inactivation of the two species of Aeromonas was similar (reduction of approximately 5-6 log after 270 min). Rhodopirellula was less susceptible (reduction of approximately 4 log after 270 min). As previously observed, the Gram-positive bacteria are more easily inactivated than Gram-negative strains, and this is even true for T. radiovictrix, D. geothermalis and D. radiodurans, which have a complex multi-layered cell wall. The results support the theory that the outer cell structures are major bacterial targets for PDI. Moreover, the chemical composition of the external structures has a stronger effect on PDI efficiency than complexity and the number of layers of the external coating, and lipids seem to be an important target of PDI.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass Dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  - The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. In the present study, 47 LAB strains were isolated from farmed seabass ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16S rDNA and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA - polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). Their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecium (59%), Enterococcus faecalis (21%), Enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), Enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), Enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and Lactococcus lactis (1 strain). An Aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. The survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. Different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. More than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Vibrio anguillarum, and Carnobacterium sp. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.
TI  - Defensin of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  - A 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot cDNA library developed in our laboratory. The D. polymorpha defensin (Dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. The mature Dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin A domain. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that this Dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. Predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin A. The recombinant Dpd was in vitro expressed through an Escherichia coli expression system. The antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant Dpd were found against the growth of Morganella sp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Edwardsiella tarda, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus aureus (ATCC12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microM, respectively. However, with less than 50 microM no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, Motile Aeromonas, Flavobacterium sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium ATCC14581, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum ATCC27865, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Micrococcus leteus ATCC4698), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of Dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the Dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. By using the quantitative PCR, the expression level of Dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. By comparing the amount of Dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qPCR, we found that the higher expression levels of Dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. Findings of this study suggest that the expression of the Dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - One strain of Lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of Lactobacillus reuteri and  Lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against Clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. Isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at pH 2.5 and were examined for their ability to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. There was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. L. salivarius G11 and L. amylovorus S6 adhered to the HT-29 epithelial cell line. Cell-free supernatant of L. amylovorus S6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including C. perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, Edwardsiella tarda, and Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.
TI  - Acute phase response in zebrafish upon Aeromonas salmonicida and Staphylococcus aureus infection: striking similarities and obvious differences with mammals.
AB  - Zebrafish has emerged as a valuable model for immunological studies. However, little is known about the overall picture of its immune response to infectious pathogens. Here we present the first systematic study of its immune response to Aeromonas salmonicida and Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-negative and a Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Genes induced upon infection were identified with suppression subtractive hybridization, with many of them encoding acute phase proteins (APPs). When compared with mammals, striking similarities and obvious differences have been observed. Both similar APPs (SAA, hepcidin and haptoglobin, etc.) and a similar system for the induction of APPs (which involves the TLRs, pro-inflammatory cytokines and C/EBPs) were identified, implying evolutionary conserved mechanisms among fish and mammals. Some novel APPs were also discovered, suggesting different immune strategies adopted by fish species. Among which, LECT2 was induced by up to 1000-fold upon infection, shedding new lights on the function of this gene. Our results constitute the first demonstration of a similar while different immune response in zebrafish and open new avenues for the investigation of evolutionary conserved and fish specific mechanisms of innate immunity.
TI  - Transcription analysis of the Staphylococcus aureus gene encoding penicillin-binding protein 4.
AB  - The high level of cross-linking found in Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan is dependent on the low-molecular-weight penicillin-binding protein PBP4. Recently, the PBP4 gene, pbpD, was cloned and shown to be adjacent to and divergently transcribed relative to the putative ABC-type transporter gene, abcA. Disruption of abcA (in strain KB400) was previously shown to result in heightened resistance to several antibiotics known to interact with PBP4, suggesting that the regulation of pbpD is affected by abcA. In this report, this hypothesis was confirmed by use of a Northern (RNA) blot analysis which revealed increased accumulation of pbpD-specific transcripts in KB400 compared to that in the wild-type strain, 8325-4. By using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to examine the structure of the peptidoglycan, it was demonstrated that the increased expression of pbpD resulted in an increased level of peptidoglycan cross-linking in the staphylococcal cell wall. Promoter fusion studies demonstrated that the abcA mutation caused approximately 7-fold and 100-fold increases in pbpD and abcA promoter activities, respectively. Primer extension experiments revealed that these genes have long, untranslated leader sequences that result in a transcriptional overlap of 80 bp. Interestingly, deletion of a 26-bp region containing an inverted repeat sequence resulted in the loss of expression from both the abcA and the pbpD promoters. These data provide evidence that abcA and pbpD are under the control of a common regulatory mechanism that may involve the transport function of the abcA gene product.
TI  - A general method to generate DNA probes for microorganisms.
AB  - We present a method that permits the rapid generation of DNA probes for eubacteria. In the procedure the variable regions for the 16s rRNA genes are amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology and primers based on the conserved regions of these genes. Following sequencing of the variable regions, a choice is possible for a probe specific for that organism. No knowledge of the molecular biology of the microorganism is required prior to the application of this approach. The generality of the method is shown using Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aeromonas salmonicida and Mycobacterium bovis. A. salmonicida was examined in detail and a DNA probe was prepared that distinguishes it from other Aeromonas species.
TI  - Immunoglobulin binding by the regular surface array of Aeromonas salmonicida.
AB  - The cell surface of Aeromonas salmonicida is covered by a regular surface array composed of a single species of protein, the A-protein (Phipps, B. M., Trust, T. J., Ishiguro, E. E., and Kay, W. W. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 2934-2939). The array, known as the A-layer, is the key virulence factor for this organism. Cells containing the A-layer specifically bound rabbit IgG and human IgM with high affinity (KD = 1.0 X 10(-6) M and 3.3 X 10(-6) M, respectively), but neither isogenic A-protein-deficient strains nor an Aeromonas hydrophila strain also possessing a regular surface array had binding activity. Selective removal of A-protein at pH 2.2 inactivated IgG binding. Structurally intact IgG was requisite for binding since both Fab and Fc fragments were inactive. Aeromonas A-protein did not share the same IgG binding sites as Staphylococcus aureus protein A. Purified A-protein bound IgG only weakly, but reassembled A-layer regained binding activity. Protein modification and perturbation of the A-layer indicated that no single amino acid residue was critical for binding, and that the binding site consisted of a native arrangement of at least four A-protein monomers in the layer.
