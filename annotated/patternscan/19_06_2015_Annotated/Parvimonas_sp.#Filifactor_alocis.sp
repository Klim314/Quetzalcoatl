TI  == bacteria community study of combined periodontal-endodontic lesions using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing analysis.
AB  == background: the entire microbial population and predominant microflora of root canals (rcs) and adjacent periodontal pockets (pps) from teeth with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions were determined and compared. methods: pooled rc and pp samples were collected from the molars of 20 patients diagnosed with combined periodontal-endodontic lesions. dna was extracted for polymerase chain reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), cloning, and sequence analysis. a coefficient of similarity (cs) was used to determine the similarity of the bacterial profiles from rcs and pps. results: significantly fewer bands were produced by pcr-dgge from rcs (5.9 +/- 1.7) than from pps (8.0 +/- 1.8) (p <0.001). the average cs of the rc and pp samples was 93.81% +/- 10.26%. overall, 60 genera/species were identified by sequencing. of these, the predominant genera in rcs were porphyromonas sp. (13.9%), filifactor sp. (12.5%), and parvimonas sp. (11.1%), similar to the genera obtained from pp samples. in total, 43 genera/species were common to the rc and pp samples. the most prevalent bacteria in both the rc and pp samples were (in descending order) filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the high similarity in the sets of organisms present in both rc and  pp samples in this study suggests that the pocket could be a source of rc infection. the data also demonstrate that combined periodontal-endodontic lesions consist of a diverse and complex microbial community.

TI  == a consortium of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and filifactor alocis is present in sites prior to bone loss in a  longitudinal study of localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced localized aggressive periodontitis  (lap) in african-american adolescents has been documented but is poorly understood. two thousand fifty-eight adolescents aged 11 to 17 years were screened for their periodontal status and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity. seventy-one a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative and 63 a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontally healthy subjects were enrolled, sampled, examined, and radiographed yearly for 3 years. gingival and periodontal pocket depth and attachment levels were recorded. disease presentation was characterized by bone loss (bl). subgingival sites were sampled every 6 months to assess (i) the role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in bl and (ii) the association of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and other microbes in their relationships to bl. sixteen of 63 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans developed bl (the other 47 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans had no bl). no a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative subjects developed bl. human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) was used for subgingival microbial assessment. on a subject level, pooled data from a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects who remained healthy had higher prevalences of streptococcus and actinomyces species, while a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects with bl had higher prevalences of parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and peptostreptococcus sp. human oral taxon 113 (hot-113). at vulnerable sites, a. actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and f. alocis levels were elevated prior to bl. in cases where the three-organism consortium (versus a. actinomycetemcomitans alone) was detected, the specificity for detecting sites of future bl increased from 62% to 99%, with a sensitivity of 89%. we conclude that  detecting the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. parasanguinis, and f. alocis together indicates sites of future bl in lap. a synergistic interaction of this consortium in lap causation is possible and is the subject of ongoing research.

TI  == microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of african-american children with localized aggressive periodontitis (lap). fifty-one children were included. subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (dd) and healthy sites (dh) in lap and from healthy sites in hs and hc and analyzed by 16s rrna-based microarrays. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (or = 8.3, p = 0.0025)  and abundant (p < 0.01) in dd. filifactor alocis (fa) was also found to be more prevalent in dd (or 2.31, ci 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). most prevalent species in healthy sites were selenomonas spp, veillonella spp, streptococcus spp, bergeyella sp, and kingella oralis. overall, streptococcus spp, campylobacter gracilis, capnocytophaga granulosa, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while aa, fa, tannerella sp, solobacterium moorei, parvimonas micra, and capnocytophaga sp were most abundant  in lap. based on a comprehensive analysis with 16s rrna-based microarrays, aa was strongly associated and site-specific in lap. in contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (clinicaltrials.gov number ct01330719). abbreviations: healthy site in healthy sibling (hs); healthy  site in healthy control child (hc).

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.
