TI  == biomineralization and formulation of endosulfan degrading bacterial and fungal consortiums.
AB  == microbial degradation offers an effective approach to remove toxicants and in this study, a microbial consortium consisting of bacterial strains and fungal strains were originally obtained from endosulfan contaminated agricultural soils. identification of the bacterial isolates by 16s rrna sequences revealed the isolates to be halophilic bacterium jas4, klebsiella pneumoniae jas8, enterobacter asburiae jas5, and enterobacter cloacae jas7, whereas the fungal isolates were identified by 18s rrna sequences and the isolates were botryosphaeria laricina jas6, aspergillus tamarii jas9 and lasiodiplodia sp. jas12. the biodegradation of endosulfan was monitored by using hplc and ftir analysis. the bacterial and fungal consortium could degrade 1000 mg l(-1) of endosulfan efficiently in aqueous medium and in soil. the infrared spectrum of endosulfan degraded samples in the aqueous medium by bacterial and fungal consortium showed bands at 1400 and 950 cm(-1) which are the characteristics of cooh group and acid dimer band respectively. in the present investigation, low cost solid materials such as sawdust, soil, fly ash, molasses and nutrients were  used for the formulation of microbial consortium and to achieve greater multiplication and survival of the microbial strains.

TI  == evidence of polyethylene biodegradation by bacterial strains from the guts of plastic-eating waxworms.
AB  == polyethylene (pe) has been considered nonbiodegradable for decades. although the  biodegradation of pe by bacterial cultures has been occasionally described, valid evidence of pe biodegradation has remained limited in the literature. we found that waxworms, or indian mealmoths (the larvae of plodia interpunctella), were capable of chewing and eating pe films. two bacterial strains capable of degrading pe were isolated from this worm's gut, enterobacter asburiae yt1 and bacillus sp. yp1. over a 28-day incubation period of the two strains on pe films, viable biofilms formed, and the pe films' hydrophobicity decreased. obvious damage, including pits and cavities (0.3-0.4 mum in depth), was observed on the surfaces of the pe films using scanning electron microscopy (sem) and atomic force microscopy (afm). the formation of carbonyl groups was verified using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and microattenuated total reflectance/fourier transform infrared (micro-atr/ftir) imaging microscope. suspension cultures of yt1 and yp1 (10(8) cells/ml) were able to degrade approximately 6.1 +/- 0.3% and  10.7 +/- 0.2% of the pe films (100 mg), respectively, over a 60-day incubation period. the molecular weights of the residual pe films were lower, and the release of 12 water-soluble daughter products was also detected. the results demonstrated the presence of pe-degrading bacteria in the guts of waxworms and provided promising evidence for the biodegradation of pe in the environment.

TI  == enterobacter mori sp. nov., associated with bacterial wilt on morus alba l.
AB  == two isolates of mulberry-pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased mulberry roots were investigated in a polyphasic taxonomic study. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis combined with rpob gene sequence analysis allocated strains r18-2(t) and r3-3 to the genus enterobacter, with enterobacter asburiae,  e. amnigenus, e. cancerogenus, e. cloacae subsp. cloacae, e. cloacae subsp. dissolvens and e. nimipressuralis as their closest relatives. cells of the isolates were gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods, 0.3-1.0 microm wide and 0.8-2.0 microm long, with peritrichous flagella, showing a dna g+c content of 55.1 +/- 0.5 mol%. calculation of a similarity index based on phenotypic features and fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analysis suggested that these isolates are members of e. cancerogenus or e. asburiae or a closely related species. biochemical data revealed that the isolates could be differentiated from their nearest neighbours by the presence of lysine decarboxylase activity and their ability to utilize d-arabitol. dna-dna relatedness also distinguished the two isolates from phylogenetically closely related enterobacter strains. based on these data, it is proposed that the isolates represent a novel species of the genus enterobacter, named enterobacter mori sp. nov. the type strain is r18-2(t)  ( = cgmcc 1.10322(t) = lmg 25706(t)).

TI  == isolation and characterization of plant growth promoting bacteria from non-rhizospheric soil and their effect on cowpea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp.) seedling growth.
AB  == the efficacy of four potential phosphate solubilizing enterobacter isolated from  non-rhizospheric soil in western ghat forest in india. plant growth promoting ability of these isolates was evaluated in cowpea. all are gram negative, rod shaped, 0.8-1.6 mm in size, and psychrotrophic in nature, grow from 5 to 40 degrees c (optimum temp. 28 +/- 2 degrees c). all isolates exhibits growth at a wide range of ph 6-12, optimum at ph 7.0 and tolerates up to 7% (w/v) salt concentration. 16s rrna gene sequencing reveals the confirmation of isolates to enterobacter aerogenes sp. (nii-0907 and nii-0929), enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae sp. (nii-0931) and enterobacter asburiae sp. (nii-0934) with which they share >99% sequence similarity. under in vitro conditions, all the four isolates  were found to produce indole acetic acid, p-solubilization and hydrogen cyanide.  the p-solubilizing activity coincided with a concomitant decrease in ph of the medium (ph 7.0-<3.0). the plant growth promotion properties were demonstrated through a cow pea (vigna unguiculata (l.) walp) based bioassay under greenhouse conditions. although the bacterial inoculation was found to result in significant increment in root, shoot and biomass and it stimulated bacterial counts in the rhizosphere. hence, these isolates can further formulated and used for field application.
