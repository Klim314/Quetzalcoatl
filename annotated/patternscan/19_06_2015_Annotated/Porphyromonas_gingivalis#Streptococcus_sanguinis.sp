TI  == novel antimicrobial peptide specifically active against porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, the major etiologic agent of chronic periodontitis, produces a broad spectrum of virulence factors, including outer membrane vesicles, lipopolysaccharides, hemolysins and proteinases. antimicrobial peptides (amps) including bacteriocins have been found to inhibit the growth of p. gingivalis; however, these peptides are relatively large molecules. hence, it is  difficult to synthesize them by a scale-up production. therefore, this study aimed to synthesize a shorter amp that was still active against p. gingivalis. a  peptide that contained three cationic amino acids (arg, his and lys), two anionic amino acids (glu and asp), hydrophobic amino acids residues (leu, ile, val, ala and pro) and hydrophilic residues (ser and gly) was obtained and named pep-7. its bioactivity and stability were tested after various treatments. the mechanism of  action of pep-7 and its toxicity to human red blood cells were investigated. the  pep-7 inhibited two pathogenic p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and p. gingivalis atcc 53978 (wp50) strains at a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of 1.7 microm, but was ineffective against other oral microorganisms (p. intermedia, tannerella  forsythensis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguinis). from transmission electron microscopy studies, pep-7 caused pore formation at the poles of the cytoplasmic membranes of p. gingivalis. a concentration of pep-7 at  four times that of its mbc induced some hemolysis but only at 0.3 %. the pep-7 was heat stable under pressure (autoclave at 110 and 121 degrees c) and possessed activity over a ph range of 6.8-8.5. it was not toxic to periodontal cells over a range of 70.8-4.4 mum and did not induce toxic pro-inflammatory cytokines. the pep-7 showed selective activity against porphyromonas sp. by altering the permeability barriers of p. gingivalis. the pep-7 was not mutagenic in vitro. this work highlighted the potential for the use of this synthetic pep-7 against p. gingivalis.

TI  == interleukin-6 and microrna profiles induced by oral bacteria in human atheroma derived and healthy smooth muscle cells.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with possible contributions from bacterial antigens. we aimed to investigate the role of oral bacteria as inducers of inflammatory cascades in smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy patients (athsmcs) and healthy controls (hsmcs). findings: inactivated streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gorgonii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used to stimulate inflammation in hsmcs and athsmcs. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha) was used as a positive control in all stimulations. interleukin-6 (il-6) levels were  determined from cell culture supernatants and microrna expression profiles from cells after 24 h of bacterial stimulation. genome wide expression (gwe) analyses  were performed after 5 h stimulation. all studied bacteria induced pro inflammatory il-6 production in both smcs. the most powerful inducer of il-6 was  a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.001). of the 84 studied mirnas, expression of 9 mirnas differed significantly (p </= 0.001) between hsmcs and athsmcs stimulated  with inactivated bacteria or tnfalpha. the data was divided into two groups: high il-6 producers (a. actinomytectemcomititans and tnfalpha) and low il-6 producers  (streptococcal strains and p. gingivalis). the expression of 4 mirnas (mir-181-5p, -186-5p, -28-5p and -155-5p) differed statistically significantly (p < 0.001) between healthy hsmcs and athsmcs in the low il-6 producer group. according to multidimensional scaling, two gene expression clusters were seen: one in hsmcs and one athsmcs. conclusions: our results suggest that inactivated oral bacteria induce inflammation that is differently regulated in healthy and atherosclerotic smcs.

TI  == [features of adhesion of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria and candida albicans fungi to experimental samples of basis dental plastic depending on surface roughness and polishing method].
AB  == aim: study the main surface parameters of milled polyacrylic materials using atomic force microscopy and primary microbial adhesion of periodontopathogenic group bacteria and candida albicans fungi taking into consideration the method of sample polishing. materials and methods: studied samples: mill-treated without polishing (control); ergobox polished; polished in dental laboratory conditions;  polished by a rubber brush in dentists' office. microbial strains belonging to periodontopathogenic species (clinical isolates) that had been isolated from periodontal pockets of periodontitis patients: porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis, c. albicans fungi were used for modelling experiments of primary adhesion of microbes to the material samples. results: s. sanguis had the highest degree of adhesion to polymer after milling,  p. gingivalis, c. albicans--medium, f. nucleatum--low. a significant reduction of adhesion is observed during polishing in dental laboratory conditions or ergobox, less significant--during polishing in dental office. conclusion: the data obtained allow to make a conclusion that the samples from polymer materials for preparation of prosthesis basis have varying degree of intensity of microbial adhesion of members of periodontopathogenic microflora and c. albicans fungi that depends on the polishing method, that accordingly determined the differences in colonization resistance against formation of microbial biofilm during polymer use in clinical conditions. . ,

TI  == bacteria-induced intracellular signalling in platelets.
AB  == multiple studies have now shown that various species of bacteria can stimulate platelets; many in a strain and donor-dependent manner. the signalling pathways underlying this platelet activation has been the subject of scrutiny for the last decade. the best-delineated pathway is that in response to streptococcal species, such as streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis), streptococcus gordonii (s. gordonii) and streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), where a pathway is initiated by the engagement of the low affinity igg receptor, fcgammariia. this leads to and involves the tyrosine kinase syk, the adaptor protein linker of activated t cells (lat) and subsequently both phospholipase cgamma2 (plcgamma2) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi-3-k). finally, this leads to the expression of  the alphaiibbeta3 integrin, the synthesis and release of thromboxane a2 (t x a2)  and the exocytosis of pf4, each of which plays a crucial role in secondary signalling and full platelet activation. roles for other signalling pathways in streptococcal-induced platelet activation are less clear, although an adp-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a glycoprotein ib/ix/v-mediated pathway and perhaps a complement-induced pathway have each been proposed. platelet activation by porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) at least partially shares the fcgammariia/syk/plcgamma2/pi-3-k mechanism utilised by streptococcal species. however, it has also been suggested that p. gingivalis activates platelets by two additional methods; stimulation of the protease-activated receptors leading to activation of phospholipase cbeta (plcbeta), and the engagement of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by released lipopolysaccharide leading to an ill-defined pathway which may involve pi-3-k. consequently, it appears that bacteria can stimulate platelets by eliciting multiple signalling pathways some of which are common, and some unique, to individual species.

TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == high in vitro antibacterial activity of pac-525 against porphyromonas gingivalis  biofilms cultured on titanium.
AB  == in order to investigate the potential of short antimicrobial peptides (amps) as alternative antibacterial agents during the treatment of peri-implantitis, the cytotoxic activity of three short amps, that is, pac-525, ksl-w, and ksl, was determined using the mtt assay. the antimicrobial activity of these amps, ranging in concentration from 0.0039 mg/ml to 0.5 mg/ml, against the predominant planktonic pathogens, including streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis, involved in peri-implantitis was investigated. furthermore, 2-day-old p. gingivalis biofilms cultured on titanium surfaces were  treated with pac-525 and subsequently observed and analysed using confocal laser  scanning microscopy (clsm). the average cell proliferation curve indicated that there was no cytotoxicity due to the three short amps. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values of pac-525 were 0.0625 mg/ml and 0.125 mg/ml, respectively, for p. gingivalis and 0.0078 mg/ml and 0.0156 mg/ml, respectively, for f. nucleatum. using clsm, we confirmed that compared to 0.1% chlorhexidine, 0.5 mg/ml of pac-525 caused a significant decrease in biofilm thickness and a decline in the percentage of live bacteria. these data indicate that pac-525 has unique properties that might make it suitable for the inhibition the growth of pathogenic bacteria around dental implants.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == combinatorial effects of arginine and fluoride on oral bacteria.
AB  == dental caries is closely associated with the microbial disequilibrium between acidogenic/aciduric pathogens and alkali-generating commensal residents within the dental plaque. fluoride is a widely used anticaries agent, which promotes tooth hard-tissue remineralization and suppresses bacterial activities. recent clinical trials have shown that oral hygiene products containing both fluoride and arginine possess a greater anticaries effect compared with those containing fluoride alone, indicating synergy between fluoride and arginine in caries management. here, we hypothesize that arginine may augment the ecological benefit of fluoride by enriching alkali-generating bacteria in the plaque biofilm and thus synergizes with fluoride in controlling dental caries. specifically, we assessed the combinatory effects of naf/arginine on planktonic and biofilm cultures of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and porphyromonas gingivalis with checkerboard microdilution assays. the optimal naf/arginine combinations were selected, and their combinatory effects on microbial composition were further examined in single-, dual-, and 3-species biofilm using  bacterial species-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. we found that arginine synergized with fluoride in suppressing acidogenic s. mutans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. in addition, the naf/arginine combination synergistically reduced s. mutans but enriched s. sanguinis within the multispecies biofilms. more importantly, the optimal combination of naf/arginine maintained a "streptococcal pressure" against the potential growth of oral anaerobe p. gingivalis within the alkalized biofilm. taken together, we conclude that the combinatory application of fluoride and arginine has a potential synergistic effect in maintaining a healthy oral microbial equilibrium and thus represents a promising ecological approach to caries management.

TI  == action of essential oils from brazilian native and exotic medicinal species on oral biofilms.
AB  == background: essential oils (eo) obtained from twenty medicinal and aromatic plants were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the oral pathogens candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the eo was evaluates by microdilution method determining minimal inhibitory concentration. chemical analysis of the oils compounds was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (cg-ms). the most active eo were also investigated as to their actions on the biolfilm formation. results: the most of  the essential oils (eo) presented moderate to strong antimicrobial activity against the oral pathogens (mic--minimal inhibitory concentrations values between 0.007 and 1.00 mg/ml). the essential oil from coriandrum sativum inhibited all oral species with mic values from 0.007 to 0.250 mg/ml, and mbc/mfc (minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations) from 0.015 to 0.500 mg/ml. on the other hand the essential oil of c. articulatus inhibited 63.96% of s. sanguis biofilm formation. through scanning eletronic microscopy (sem) images no changes were observed in cell morphology, despite a decrease in biofilm formation and changes  on biofilm structure. chemical analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) of the c. sativum essential oil revealed major compounds derivatives from alcohols and aldehydes, while cyperus articulatus and aloysia gratissima (eos) presented mono and sesquiterpenes. conclusions: in conclusion, the crude oil from c. articulatus exhibited the best results of antimicrobial activity e ability to  control biofilm formation. the chemical analysis showed the presence of terpenes  and monoterpenes such as a-pinene, a-bulnesene and copaene. the reduction of biofilms formation was confirmed from sem images. the results of this research shows a great potential from the plants studied as new antimicrobial sources.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (no)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and  silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. the effectiveness of macromolecular no release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis viability. in contrast, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to no treatment. both dendrimer- and silica-based no release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine.  these results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular no-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.

TI  == bioinformatic investigation of the cost management strategies of five oral microbes.
AB  == some amino acids are more energetically costly to synthesize de novo, therefore many microbes have evolved to regulate the metabolic expenditure of the cell and  reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. several oral bacterial species take up amino acids and peptides obtained from proteolysis of host proteins and hence do not rely only on de novo synthesis. the aim of this study was to investigate if five oral bacterial species implement cost management strategies to reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. since the relative de novo amino acid synthesis costs are proportional to the masses of the amino acids, the energy costs of producing proteins were assessed by calculating the mean amino acid mass for each protein. for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and  streptococcus sanguinis, the outer membrane/extracellular proteins are made up of a much larger percentage of lower average mass amino acids whereas cytoplasmic proteins are made up of a larger proportion of higher average mass amino acid residues. these results are consistent with the five oral bacterial species employing energy-saving mechanisms in the production of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. interestingly, the p. gingivalis and s. sanguinis genomes  exhibited significantly lower predicted mean amino acid masses compared with those of the genomes of the other three species, suggesting that this may provide them with an energy advantage with respect to protein biosynthetic cost.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == antagonistic effect of protein extracts from on pathogenic bacteria and fungi of  the oral cavity.
AB  == an antibacterial substance from streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis) is known to have an inhibitory effect on putative periodontal pathogens, but its inhibitory effect on pathogens of oral candidiasis is unknown. in this study, intracellular and exocrine proteins were extracted from s. sanguinis. the antagonistic effect of the protein extracts on prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) was detected by a well-plate technique, and the effects of the protein extracts on biofilms formed  by these bacteria were evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. the antagonistic effect of the protein extracts on pathogenic fungi was investigated  using candida albicans (c. albicans) and candida tropicalis (c. tropicalis). the  growth curves of c. albicans and c. tropicalis were determined from ultraviolet absorption measurements, their morphological changes following treatment were observed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the effects  of the protein extracts on the thickness of their biofilms and the distribution of dead/live bacteria within the biofilms were detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. the results showed significant inhibitory effects of the intracellular proteins extracted from s. sanguinis on pathogenic bacteria (p. intermedia and p. gingivalis), fungi (c. albicans and c. tropicalis) and the biofilms formed by them. furthermore, the growth curves and morphology of c. albicans and c. tropicalis were altered following treatment with the intracellular proteins, resulting in disc-like depressions in the surfaces of the fungal spores and mycelia. by contrast, the exocrine proteins demonstrated no significant inhibitory effect on the pathogenic bacteria, fungi and the biofilms  formed by them. thus, it may be concluded that intracellular proteins of s. sanguinis have antibacterial activity and exert an antagonistic effect on certain pathogenic bacteria and fungi of the oral cavity.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == does photodynamic therapy enhance standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry?
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to assess whether or not photodynamic therapy enhanced standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry. background data: photodynamic therapy when used as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy  kills more bacteria than when conventional periodontal therapy is used alone. materials and methods: to address the focused question, "does photodynamic therapy enhance killing of oral bacteria?" pubmed/medline((r)) and google scholar databases were explored. original human and experimental studies and studies using photodynamic therapy for killing oral bacteria were included. letters to the editor, historic reviews, and unpublished data were excluded. results: photodynamic therapy significantly reduces periodontopathogenic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis. photodynamic therapy kills cariogenic bacteria (such as streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis), bacteria associated with infected root canals, and those associated with periimplantitis. conclusions: photodynamic therapy, when used as an adjunct to conventional oral disinfection protocols, enhances standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == altered phenotype and function of dendritic cells in individuals with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

AB  == background: the mechanism of action of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the treatment of peri-implantitis is not well understood. the aim of this study is to investigate antibiotic susceptibility of an in vitro biofilm by isothermal microcalorimetry (imc). methods: titanium disks containing a 72-hour three-species biofilm (streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068, fusobacterium nucleatum  atcc10953, and porphyromonas gingivalis dsm20709) were placed in a series of imc  ampoules with nutrient agar supplemented with increasing concentrations of amoxicillin, metronidazole, or their combination and incubated anaerobically for  10 days. lag time and maximum growth rate were determined from continuous heat-flow recordings of metabolic activity. to validate the imc biofilm results,  adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis were incubated anaerobically in medium supplemented with antibiotics at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and their vitality was determined by live/dead staining, conventional culturing, and imc. results: in all biofilm samples incubated with antibiotics, a prolonged lag phase was observed compared with controls (p <0.05). maximum growth rate was significantly  lower for samples treated with either amoxicillin or metronidazole compared with  controls (p <0.05). combining the antibiotics did not improve this effect. concentrations exceeding 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentration completely inhibited the growth of adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis, whereas lower concentrations resulted in only a delay in the lag phase. a poor correlation was  observed between live/dead staining and conventional culturing. conclusions: imc  gives new evidence about antibiotic effects on oral biofilms and is more informative than conventional culture and live/dead assays. the combination of antibiotics was found to be more efficient than metronidazole alone; however, only minor differences in growth inhibition were detected compared with amoxicillin alone.

TI  == effects of er:yag laser on bacteria associated with titanium surfaces and cellular response in vitro.
AB  == this in vitro study examined (a) the anti-bacterial efficacy of a pulsed erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (er:yag) laser applied to streptococcus sanguinis or porphyromonas gingivalis adhered to either polished or microstructured titanium implant surfaces, (b) the response of osteoblast-like cells and (c) adhesion of oral bacteria to titanium surfaces after laser irradiation. thereto, (a) bacteria adhered to titanium disks were irradiated with a pulsed er:yag laser (lambda = 2,940 nm) at two different power settings: a lower mode (12.74 j/cm(2) calculated energy density) and a higher mode (63.69 j/cm(2)). (b) after laser irradiation with both settings of sterile titanium, disks were seeded with 10(4) mg-63 cells/cm(2). adhesion and proliferation were determined after 1, 4, and 24 h by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron  microscopy. (c) bacterial adhesion was also studied on irradiated (test) and non-irradiated (control) surfaces. adhered p. gingivalis were effectively killed, even at the lower laser setting, independent of the material's surface. s. sanguinis cells adhered were effectively killed only at the higher setting of 63.69 j/cm(2). laser irradiation of titanium surfaces had no significant effects  on (b) adhesion or proliferation of osteoblast-like mg-63 cells or (c) adhesion of both oral bacterial species in comparison to untreated surfaces. an effective  decontamination of polished and rough titanium implant surfaces with a er:yag laser could only be achieved with a fluence of 63.69 j/cm(2). even though this setting may lead to certain surface alterations, no significant adverse effect on subsequent colonization and proliferation of mg-63 cells or increased bacterial adhesion was found in comparison to untreated control surfaces.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  == this report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. streptococcus gordonii (sg)/s. oralis (so)/s. sanguinis (ss) and sg/fusobacterium nucleatum (fn)/porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of il-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an  additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. only the sg/actinomyces naeslundii  (an)/fn multispecies biofilms elicited il-6 levels above those of control. il-8 was a primary response to the sg/an/fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. these results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial adhesion on machined titanium, osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) discs.
AB  == purpose: bacterial adhesion and colonization play a crucial function in the pathogenesis of peri-implant tissue infection, which is considered the main cause of fixture loss. the aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in bacterial adhesion between a machined titanium surface, a double acid etched surface (osseotite(r)) and an osseotite surface with nanometer-scale discrete crystalline deposition (dcd) of calcium phosphate (cap)(nanotite(r)). methods: surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (sem) observation. bacterial adhesion on machined, osseotite(r), and nanotite(r) discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: streptococcus mutans ccug 35176, streptococcus sanguis ccug 17826, streptococcus salivarius ccug 11878, actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans ccug 37002, porphyromonas gingivalis ccug 2521. the assessment of bacterial adhesion was performed by comparing two methods: total viable count (tvc) estimation and confocal laser scanning microscopic (cslm) studies. results: the surface roughness parameter increased as follows: machined<nanotite(r)<osseotite(r). the attachment of all bacterial strains performed by both methods showed a significant reduction on osseotite(r) and even higher on nanotite(r) in comparison to machined surfaces (p<0.05). the reduction  in bacterial attachment was more significant on osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) for  a. actinomycetecomitans, s. mutans and s. sanguis than for p. gingivalis and s. salivarius strains. conclusions: nanotite(r) samples showed the lowest amount of  bacterial contamination in comparison to the smoother machined and rougher osseotite(r) surfaces.

TI  == isothermal microcalorimetry provides new insights into biofilm variability and dynamics.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate a three-species in vitro biofilm with peri-implantitis-related bacteria for its variability and metabolic activity. streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were suspended in simulated body fluid containing 0.2% glucose to form biofilms on polished, protein-coated implant-grade titanium disks over 72 h using a flow chamber system. thereafter, biofilm-coated disks were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization/confocal laser scanning microscopy. to assess metabolic activity within the biofilms, their heat flow was recorded for 480 h at 37 degrees c by imc. the microscopic methods revealed that the total number of bacteria in the biofilms varied slightly among specimens (2.59 x 10(4) +/- 0.67 x 10(4) cells mm(-2) ), whereas all three species were found constantly with unchanged proportions (s. sanguinis  41.3 +/- 4.8%, f. nucleatum 17.7 +/- 2.1%, and p. gingivalis 41.0 +/- 4.9%). imc  revealed minor differences in time-to-peak heat flow (20.6 +/- 4.5 h), a trend consistent with the small variation in bacterial species proportions as shown by  microscopy. peak heat flow (35.8 +/- 42.6 muw), mean heat flow (13.1 +/- 22.0 muw), and total heat over 480 h (23.5 +/- 37.2 j) showed very high variation. these imc results may be attributed to differences in the initial cell counts and relative proportions of the three species, their distribution and embedment in exopolysaccharide matrix on the test specimens. the present results provide new insights into variability and dynamics of biofilms on titanium disks, aspects that should be explored in future studies of dental surfaces.

TI  == levels of selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: to compare the levels of selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique. between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the mann-whitney u-test. results: subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, s. sputigena and the mitsuokella sp. human oral taxon (hot) 131 (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone cs002), while higher mean counts of actinomyces gerencseriae and streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). selenomonas sp. hot 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of p. gingivalis and s. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive  periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. there were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of p. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), s. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and selenomonas dianae (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone ew076) (r  = 0.42, p < 0.05). conclusion: s. sputigena and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated  further.

TI  == effect of streptococcus sanguinis/porphyromonas gingivalis single and combined biofilms upon platelet aggregation.
AB  == objective: to assess the effect of two oral bacteria streptococcus sanguinis and  porphyromonas gingivalis upon platelet aggregation. materials and methods: streptococcus sanguinis, p. gingivalis, s. sanguniis+p. gingivalis were added to  platelet-rich plasma and platelet aggregation measured using a platelet aggregometer. platelets were passed through a flow chamber with s. sanguinis, p.  gingivalis or a biofilm of s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis coated with saliva. platelet adhesion to the chamber was observed under a fluorescence microscope for 15min. the positive control was platelets treated with adrenaline; the negative control was platelets treated with phosphate-buffered saline. results: the mean (+/- s.e.) aggregation magnitude of s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis was 77.7+/-7.4% and 79.3+/-9.9%, respectively. the aggregation magnitude of s. sanguinis+p. gingivalis was 51.3+/-12.9%, which was significantly lower than that for s. sanguinis/p. gingivalis (p<0.05). in the flow chamber system, platelets adhered to s. sanguinis/p.gingivalis respectively within 3min, and reached a plateau at 5-15min. under the condition of the s. sanguinis- and p. gingivalis-saliva biofilm, platelet adhesion to the biofilm was significantly reduced at 5-15min (p<0.05). conclusions: in the static or dynamic flow system, platelets adhered to s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis. however, if s. sanguinis was  mixed with p. gingivalis, the aggregation magnitude (%) was significantly reduced.

AB  == background: honey has a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial action that may make  it suitable for "anti-infective" treatment of periodontal disease. the aims of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of honey against oral bacteria and compare the same with 0.2% chlorhexidine; and 2) to compare antiplaque efficacy in vivo with chlorhexidine. methods: the study was conducted in two parts. in the in vitro part, the inhibitory effects of three test agents, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, honey mouthwash, and saline, against six oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512  mug/ml were tested in duplicate. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was set as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. the in vivo part consisted of a double-masked parallel clinical trial based on a 4-day plaque regrowth model. sixty-six volunteers, 20 to 24 years of age, participated in the study, and the plaque scores were compared at baseline and at the end of 4 days. the kruskal-wallis test was used for significance, and the mann-whitney u test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups. the mean plaque scores were 1.77 +/- 0.86, 1.64 +/- 0.90, and 3.27 +/- 0.83 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. results: the honey mouthrinse effectively inhibited the six tested microorganisms. the chlorhexidine gluconate  rinse had the lowest mics compared with honey and saline rinses for all test species examined. the in vivo results revealed that plaque formation was inhibited/reduced by chlorhexidine and honey rinses. conclusion: honey has antibacterial action against tested oral microorganisms and also has antiplaque action.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == oral bacterial dna differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  == background: deoxyribonucleic acids (dna) of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human  monocytic cells (thp-1) through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and nuclear factor-kappab signaling. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. we investigate inflammatory mediator production in thp-1 cells challenged with fn and streptococcus sanguinis (ss) dna, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or pg lipopolysaccharide (lps) are affected by tlr-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). methods: thp-1 cells were stimulated with pg-dna (100 ng/mul), fn-dna (100 ng/mul), ss-dna (100 ng/mul), pg-lps (10 ng/mul), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/ml). interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using dunnett or tukey methods and paired t test. a value of p <0.05 was significant. results: inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of ss-dna (p <0.05). chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from thp-1 cells with the exception of il-6 production triggered by whole fn and ss (p <0.05). conclusions: differences exist among oral bacterial dna in inducing immune responses. by altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might  be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.

TI  == influence of gaseous ozone in peri-implantitis: bactericidal efficacy and cellular response. an in vitro study using titanium and zirconia.
AB  == dental implants are prone to bacterial colonization which may result in bone destruction and implant loss. treatments of peri-implant disease aim to reduce bacterial adherence while leaving the implant surface intact for attachment of bone-regenerating host cells. the aims of this study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of gaseous ozone on bacteria adhered to various titanium and zirconia surfaces and to evaluate adhesion of osteoblast-like mg-63 cells to  ozone-treated surfaces. saliva-coated titanium (sla and polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) disks served as substrates for the adherence of streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277. the test specimens were treated with gaseous ozone (140 ppm; 33 ml/s) for 6 and 24 s. bacteria were resuspended using ultrasonication, serially diluted and cultured. mg-63 cell adhesion was analyzed with reference to cell attachment, morphology, spreading, and proliferation. surface topography as well as cell morphology of the test specimens were inspected by sem. the highest bacterial adherence was found on titanium sla whereas the other surfaces revealed 50-75% less adherent bacteria. p. gingivalis was eliminated by ozone from all surfaces within 24 s to  below the detection limit (>/=99.94% reduction). s. sanguinis was more resistant  and showed the highest reduction on zirconia substrates (>90% reduction). ozone treatment did not affect the surface structures of the test specimens and did not influence osteoblastic cell adhesion and proliferation negatively. titanium (polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) had a lower colonization potential and may be suitable material for implant abutments. gaseous ozone showed selective efficacy to reduce adherent bacteria on titanium and zirconia without affecting adhesion and proliferation of osteoblastic cells. this in vitro study may provide a solid basis for clinical studies on gaseous ozone treatment of peri-implantitis and revealed an essential base for sufficient tissue regeneration.

TI  == novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  == oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. to provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host  cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (rgpls), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. bacterial species belonging  to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or  three-species biofilms, with each group comprising streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis; s. gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum; or s. gordonii, f. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative pcr (qpcr) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in  single-species and multispecies biofilms. we evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and hoechst 33258 and novel syto red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy  (clsm). substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. the specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == bactericidal effects of different laser systems on bacteria adhered to dental implant surfaces: an in vitro study comparing zirconia with titanium.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to examine in vitro the anti-bacterial  efficacy of two different laser systems (co(2) and diode) applied to streptococcus sanguinis or porphyromonas gingivalis cells in suspensions or adhered to zirconia or titanium dental implant materials, with two different surfaces each. materials and methods: bacteria were irradiated at two different power settings with either a co(2) (lambda=10,600 nm) or a diode laser (lambda=810 nm). the lower mode is used clinically (for co(2) 100 j/cm(2), diode  50 j/cm(2)) and the higher may alter the materials' surface (for co(2) 1200 j/cm(2), diode 150 j/cm(2)). after irradiation, the number of viable bacteria was determined by culture. results: planktonic cells of both species were more resistant to the laser irradiations than bacteria that adhered to surfaces. adhered p. gingivalis were effectively killed at both wavelengths lambda=10,600 and 810 nm even at the lower settings, independent of the material. s. sanguinis  cells that adhered to either zirconia surface were effectively killed by the co(2) laser at the lower setting of 100 j/cm(2). however, the higher settings of  both lasers were needed to reduce s. sanguinis that adhered to titanium surfaces. the co(2) laser at the lower setting and the diode laser at the higher setting effectively reduced the viability of s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis that adhered to zirconia surfaces. conclusions: under irradiation conditions known not to alter zirconia implant surfaces in vitro, both co(2) laser (100 j/cm(2)) and the  diode laser (150 j/cm(2)) effectively reduced the viability of adhered s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis.

TI  == contemporary root canal irrigants are able to disrupt and eradicate single- and dual-species biofilms.
AB  == introduction: clinical/microbiological studies have consistently revealed the persistence of some bacteria after conventional root canal debridement. although  this was originally attributed to the complexity of the root canal anatomy and the difficulty of delivering antibacterial agents effectively, it has emerged that the biofilm encasement of bacterial cells may confer a further mechanism of  resistance. the purpose of this study was to investigate the relative disruption  and bactericidal effects of root canal irrigants on single- and dual-species biofilms of root canal isolates. methods: biofilms of streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were grown on nitrocellulose membranes for 72 hours and immersed in naocl, edta, chlorhexidine, and iodine for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. the number of viable and nonviable bacteria disrupted from the biofilm and those remaining adherent were determined by using a viability stain in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. results: gram-negative obligate anaerobe species were more susceptible to cell removal than gram-positive facultative anaerobes. the majority of cells were disrupted after the first minute of exposure; however, the extent varied according to the agent and species. the most effective agent at disrupting biofilms was naocl. iodine was generally effective at bacterial killing but not disruption. conclusions: biofilm disruption and cell viability were influenced by the species, their coassociation in dual-species biofilms, the test agent, and the duration of exposure. the effectiveness of naocl as an endodontic irrigant was reinforced.

TI  == tlr2 sensing of f. nucleatum and s. sanguinis distinctly triggered gingival innate response.
AB  == gingival tissue faces constant exposure to micro-organisms. it functions as part  of the host response, an anti-microbial barrier that recognizes and discriminates between commensal and pathogenic bacteria. this study aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of cell wall extracts from different periodontal bacteria, commensals streptococcus sanguinis and fusobacterium nucleatum and the pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, on the innate immune response of gingival keratinocytes and the role of tlr2 in regulating this. we assayed mrna levels to determine the  expression of human beta-defensins (hbetad2, hbetad3), interleukin-1alpha, -1beta, 6 and 8 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. f. nucleatum extracts induced beta-defensin and inflammatory marker mrna expression at higher levels than p. gingivalis. extracts from the gram-positive commensal s. sanguinis did not upregulate the host response. tlr2 extinction inhibited the upregulation of beta-defensin and cytokine transcripts by f. nucleatum extracts but, in contrast, led to a weak induction of hbetad3 after challenge with s. sanguinis extracts. although f. nucleatum strongly induces innate immune and inflammatory mediators,  s. sanguinis limits their expression through tlr2. together, our data demonstrate that gingival keratinocytes recognize and discriminate between gram-positive and  gram-negative commensal extracts, in part through tlr2, to activate different signaling pathways of the innate immune host response.

AB  == objective: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have increased  understanding of the distribution of oral bacterial species in clinical specimens, though few investigations have been conducted to simultaneously detect oral streptococcal and periodontal species in the same specimens. the purpose of  the present study was to investigate the distribution and correlation of 6 oral streptococcal and 6 periodontal species in saliva specimens taken from children and their mothers. design: seventy-four pairs of children and their mothers were  approved to participate in this study. saliva specimens were collected and bacterial dna extracted, which was subjected to pcr analyses using species-specific sets of primers. the combinations of species able to be detected simultaneously were determined by statistical analyses. results: streptococcus sobrinus and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected more often in the mothers than the children. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus oralis were detected simultaneously in a significant number of specimens, while the presence of campylobacter rectus was correlated with the presence of at least one of the red complex species (p. gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythensis). on the other hand, no correlation was shown between the rates of detection of oral streptococcal and periodontal species. conclusions: our results indicate that among streptococcal and periodontal species, several are able to coexist in saliva, while the presence of both does not have an influence on each other.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

AB  == coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. bifidobacterium adolescentis olb6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii jcm8350, streptococcus mitis ols3293, streptococcus sanguinis jcm5708, veillonella parvula atcc17745 or porphyromonas gingivalis ob7124, but it did coaggregate with fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using fish revealed that b. adolescentis olb6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. it did, however, adhere to biofilms of a. naeslundii, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with a. naeslundii nor with v.  parvula. these results suggest that the adhesion of b. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. heat- or proteinase k-treated f. nucleatum could not coaggregate with b. adolescentis. similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase k-treated b. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. it is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of b. adolescentis and f. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. the data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. the antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. the growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by naocl  and chlorhexidine solution. the largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all naocl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). however, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. the results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (rt group) and in 13 matched controls. material and methods: the microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. a clinical examination was also performed. results: candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the rt subjects and in 15% of the controls. in three rt subjects, c. albicans  was found at all four sites analysed. an unexpected finding was that enterococci  were found in all rt subjects and in high number in 38%. none of the controls harboured enterococci. in supragingival plaque, lactobacillus spp. were detected  in 92% of the rt subjects and the number and proportion of lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the rt subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. conclusion: the microbial results explain why some rt subjects have an increased  susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis  is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for rt  subjects.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == stimulation of fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aims: bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. the aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas  gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. methods: microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees c under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. results: f. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. biofilm formation by f. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by p. gingivalis. it was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with p. gingivalis. enhancement of biofilm formation  by p. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxs. conclusion: the results suggest that p. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by f. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  == extracts or alkaloids isolated from mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. in this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a m. aquifolium  extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the m. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. the values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. the most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  == aim: to explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (uv) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. methodology: the sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to uv light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm uv, at a fluence of 1-20 mj cm(-2). an experimental model was  designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of uv light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. results: direct exposure to relatively low doses of uv light (2-7 mj cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. furthermore, an enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to uv light (p < 0.001). uv was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. when 4 bacterial  cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the uv light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. conclusions: the application of uv light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the uv light dose adapted accordingly.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == bacterial profile and burden of periodontal infection in subjects with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. it is possible that the stimulation of host responses to oral infections may result in vascular damage and the inducement of blood clotting. the aim of this study was to assess the role of periodontal infection and bacterial burden as an explanatory variable to the activation of the inflammatory process leading to acute coronary syndrome (acs). methods: a total of 161 consecutive surviving cases admitted with a diagnosis of acs and 161 control subjects, matched with cases according to their gender, socioeconomic level, and smoking status, were studied. serum white blood cell (wbc) counts, high- and low-density lipoprotein (hdl/ldl) levels, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsc-rp) levels, and clinical periodontal routine parameters were studied. the subgingival pathogens were assayed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: total oral bacterial load was higher in the subjects with acs (mean difference: 17.4x10(5); sd: 10.8; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4.2 to 17.4; p<0.001), and significant for 26 of 40 species including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. serum wbc counts, hsc-rp levels, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis,  were explanatory factors to acute coronary syndrome status (nagelkerke r2=0.49).  conclusion: the oral bacterial load of s. intermedius, s. sanguis, streptococcus  anginosus, t. forsythensis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis may be concomitant risk factors in the development of acs.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

AB  == in addition to conventional treatment modalities (mechanical and chemical), the use of different lasers has been increasingly proposed for the treatment of peri-implantitis. results from both controlled clinical and basic studies have pointed to the high potential of an er:yag-laser. its excellent ability to effectively ablate dental calculus without producing major thermal side-effects to adjacent tissue has been demonstrated in numerous studies. recently, a new ultrasonic device has been used for the treatment of periodontal and peri-implantitis infections. preliminary clinical data indicate that treatment with both treatment procedures may positively influence peri-implant healing. the aim of the present review paper is to evaluate, based on the available evidence,  the use of an er:yag-laser and a newly introduced ultrasonic device for treatment of peri-implantitis in comparison to a conventional treatment approach.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases--review of publications].
AB  == nowadays periodontal diseases are treated as a one of a social diseases. the main consequences of them are: premature teeth loss and possibility of inducing, aggravating and modifying many systemic disorders, such as endo- and myocarditis, glomerulonephritis, iriditis, retinitis, rheumatic polyarthritis. the scientific  data performed in the last 10 years indicate links between periodontitis and atheromatosis, coronary heart disease and acute coronary events, including myocardial infarction. in this study reported was the epidemiological dependences between periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. there were described hypotheses  of negative influence of periodontal foci on induction and progression of inflammation in coronary vessel walls and destabilisation of atheromatous plaques, also was included theory of direct bacterial invasion and cytokine theory. there were shown results of studies which proved the presence of genetic  material of main periodontal bacterial pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, in atheromatous plaques in coronary arteries. there were noted other potential mechanisms of induction of acute coronary events connected with platelet aggregation induced by specific proteins  secreted by streptococcus sanguis and the role of helicobacter pylori infection,  the bacteria from periodontal pockets that is presently more often isolated. analysing these data it was concluded, that the co-operation between cardiologists and dentists, especially the periodontologists, is necessary during the treatment of coronary heart disease. periodontal therapy should be included as an additional element of cardiological therapy. education of patients is also  very important for prophylaxis of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == oral streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates interaction  with porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with plaque-forming bacteria is necessary for its colonization in periodontal pockets. participation of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and p. gingivalis fimbriae in this interaction has been reported. in this investigation, the contribution of various oral streptococcal gapdhs to interaction with p. gingivalis fimbriae was examined. streptococcal cell surface gapdh activity was measured by incubation of a constant number of streptococci with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and analysis for the conversion of nad+ to nadh based  on the absorbance at 340 nm. coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric assay. cell surface gapdh activity was correlated with coaggregation activity (r = 0.854, p < 0.01) with spearman's rank correlation coefficient. s. oralis atcc 9811 and atcc 10557, streptococcus gordonii g9b, streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556, and streptococcus parasanguinis atcc 15909 exhibited high cell surface gapdh activity and coaggregation activity; consequently, their cell surface gapdhs were extracted with mutanolysin and purified on a cibacron blue sepharose column. subsequently, their dna sequences were elucidated. purified gapdhs bound p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin by western blot assay, furthermore, their dna sequences displayed a high degree of homology with one another. moreover, s. oralis recombinant gapdh inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and the aforementioned five streptococcal strains in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that gapdhs of various  plaque-forming streptococci may be involved in their attachment to p. gingivalis  fimbriae and that they may contribute to p. gingivalis colonization.

TI  == [purification and characterization of sanguicin--a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus sanguis].
AB  == objective: streptococcus sanguis plays an important role in maintaining the periodontal microecological balance. previous studies have demonstrated that sanguicin--a kind of bacteriocin produced by s. sanguis has a prominent function  of inhibiting the growth of putative periodontopathic bacteria (ppb). the aim of  this study was to purify sanguicin and investigate its characters. methods: the raw extract of sanguicin was obtained from cells of s. sanguis by ultrasonication, salting out and dialysis. then the diethyl-aminoethyl-sepharose  gradual washing was done in conjunction with glucosan gel filtration for in the purfication of sanguicin. the characters of purified sanguicin were determined and its inhibitiory effect on ppb was measured by agar diffusion test. results: the purifed sanguicin was obtained; it was heat labile and proteinaceous; and by  sds-page, it showed a main band with the relative molecular mass of 65 x 10(3). the purifed sanguicin had a strong inhibitory effect on p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in vitro. conclusion: our methods are useful for the  purification of sanguicin. sanguicin has inhibitory effect on ppb obviously and will have a good prospect in periodontal ecological therapy.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the n1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a  second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.

TI  == [dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  == objective: to study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. methods: eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), provotella intermedium  (pi), streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces viscosus (av) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la) were used. these eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified bm medium supplemented with 2.5 g/l porcine gastric mucin, respectively. after 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on  removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. results: biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (p < 0.001). biofilms of aa were thinner than those of ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by ss and aa per time point. three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. conclusions: gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of gram-negative periodontal pathogens. the relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.

TI  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == pcr method is essential for detecting mycobacterium tuberculosis in oral cavity samples.
AB  == tuberculosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, and infection by mycobacterium  tuberculosis has been increasing in immunocompromised hosts, including elderly persons. m. tuberculosis-infected persons may receive dental treatment. to evaluate the risk of m. tuberculosis infection in dental clinics, we examined the detection rates of m. tuberculosis in sample of mixed saliva, dental plaque, extracted teeth, caries lesions, and denture plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the detection rates by pcr in samples from mixed saliva, dental plaque, caries lesions and denture plaque obtained from tuberculosis patients were 98.0%, 92.0%, 89.0%, and 100%, respectively. the detection rates by the culture method were 17.3%, 2.0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. m. tuberculosis also was detected from the nontuberculous mycobacteria-infected group. strains of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum inhibited the growth of clinical strains of m. tuberculosis, but strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. the present study concludes that the pcr method is essential for detecting m. tuberculosis in oral samples.

AB  == objective: to examine whether endogenous s. sanguis could prevent, or reduce the  colonization of the virulent p. gingivalis strain. methods: first, 10 specific pathogen-free wistar rats were divided into 2 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days. successful implantation of the endogenous strain of s. sanguis, isolated from one of the rats before doxycycline administration, and p. gingivalis 381 within 14 days of observation were demonstrated in the rats of each group respectively. then, 30 spf rats were divided into 6 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days to all the rats. afterwards, the rats in group a and b were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with p. gingivalis, the rats in group c and e were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with s. sanguis. then, the rats in group  a were inoculated for 5 days with s. sanguis, and rats in group c and d were inoculated for 5 days with p. gingivalis. the rats in group f served as negative  control. after inoculation, the levels of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis in the mouths of the rats were determined after 12, 24, 36 hours, 7 days and 14 days. results: both pre-colonization of s. sanguis and superinfection with s. sanguis did reduce the level of p. gingivalis in experimental rats. however, the reduction only maintained quite short time, about 36 hours. it was not caused by  the decreased level of s. sanguis after 36 hours because the level of s. sanguis  kept stable during the observation period of 14 days. conclusion: that s. sanguis function as the effector strain requires the successful implantation of s. sanguis as well as s. sanguis producing antagonistic action efficiently in vivo.

TI  == enhanced neutrophil emigration and porphyromonas gingivalis reduction following pgg-glucan treatment of mice.
AB  == periodontal disease is the consequence of a mixed gram-negative infection in the  gingival sulcus and has been associated with deficits in the neutrophil response. a novel, and heretofore untested, alternative approach to therapy is the use of biological-response modulators that enhance the neutrophil response. poly-beta1-6-glucotriosyl-beta1-3-glucopyranose glucan (pgg-glucan) is an immunomodulator, derived from yeast, which specifically enhances neutrophil priming, phagocytosis and bacterial killing while failing to induce inflammatory  cytokine expression. the hypothesis tested was that pgg-glucan could enhance host resistance to a gram-negative periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. chambers were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsolumbar region of c57bl/6j mice and allowed to heal for 14 days. pgg-glucan was administered subcutaneously to one-half of the animals and saline to the other half. in the first set of experiments the chambers were inoculated with p. gingivalis (a7436) at 4 x 10 (6), 4 x 10 (7), and 4 x 10 (8) colony-forming units (cfu). in the second set of  experiments the chambers were inoculated with 5 x 10 (8) cfu of either p. gingivalis or streptococcus sanguis, a gram-positive oral microbe that is not periodontopathic. chambers were sampled over the following 2 weeks. the results demonstrated that: (1). bacterial cfu and neutrophils increased with increasing bacterial inoculum (p<0.02); (2). bacterial cfu were lower in the pgg-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (p<0.02); and (3). neutrophil counts were higher in the pgg-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (p<0.01). these results indicate that pgg-glucan significantly enhances neutrophil emigration and bacterial killing, thus decreasing the bacterial infection in this model system.

AB  == the influence of secondary colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. hydroxyapatite (hap) discs coated with streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3h-labeled bacterial cell suspension of  f. nucleatum or a. naeslundii and then in a 14c-labeled p. gingivalis cell suspension. bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. the cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. these two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of p. gingivalis. human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of p. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to s. sanguis-coated hap discs. adherence of p. gingivalis and a. naeslundii was  strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of f. nucleatum was affected the least.  treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of p. gingivalis. the rate of decrease was much smaller in f. nucleatum. these results indicate that both f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii enhance the adherence of p. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of p. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

AB  == different kinds of infectious agents seem to be implied in the atherosclerotic process. indeed, some bacteria and viruses have been identified in atherosclerotic lesions: chlamydia pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus sanguis, porphyromonas gingivalis, herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2, coxsakievirus b and hepatitis virus a. by their ability to induce antigenic and functional changes in the cells of the vascular wall (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes/macrophages, and fibroblasts) and to stimulate immune response as well as oxidative stress, it is more and more tempting to speculate that infectious agents probably play key roles in the initiation and in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in certain patients.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  == particulate bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. this material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. the aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (nb), artificial saliva (as) or dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (dmem + 10%fcs), with or without particulate bioglass. all bacteria showed reduced viability following  exposure to bioglass in all the media after 1 h. this antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in  either bm broth or 40% horse serum (hs) in rpmi. a considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. in further experiments it was found that the viability of s. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to nb pre-incubated with bioglass. additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline  solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. moreover, a solution of nb and naoh (of equivalent ph) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with bioglass. thus, particulate bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. this may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  == recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. it has been proposed that dental plaque  bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. in this regard, streptococcus sanguis and p. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. here we report that p. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and trepenoma denticola failed to  aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of p. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. in summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by p. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) p. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == antibody-targeted lethal photosensitization of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that porphyromonas gingivalis is susceptible to killing by toluidine blue o (tbo) when irradiated with light from a helium-neon (hene) laser. the aim of this study was to determine whether a tbo-antibody conjugate (ab-tbo) could be used to specifically target p. gingivalis to lethal photosensitization in the presence of streptococcus sanguis or human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs). when a mixture of p. gingivalis and s. sanguis was exposed to 4 microg of tbo/ml and irradiated with hene laser light, there were 1.5- and 4.0-log(10)-unit reductions in the viable counts, respectively. in contrast, when tbo was conjugated with a murine monoclonal antibody against p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, the reductions in viable counts of p. gingivalis and s. sanguis amounted to 5.0 and 0.1 log(10) units, respectively. lethal photosensitization of p. gingivalis in the presence of hgfs using unconjugated tbo resulted in a 0.7-log(10)-unit reduction in p. gingivalis viable counts and a 99% reduction in the incorporation of tritiated thymidine ([(3)h]tdr) by the hgfs. in contrast, when the ab-tbo conjugate was used, there was a 100% reduction in p. gingivalis viable counts but no significant reduction in the incorporation  of [(3)h]tdr by hgfs. these results demonstrate that specific targeting of p. gingivalis can be achieved using tbo conjugated to a monoclonal antibody raised against a cell surface component of this organism.

TI  == effect of the interleukin-1 genotype on monocyte il-1beta expression in subjects  with adult periodontitis.
AB  == an association has been reported between polymorphisms in the genes encoding il-1alpha (-889) and il-1beta (+3953) (periodontitis susceptibility trait, pst),  and an increased severity of periodontitis (18). the il-1beta polymorphism was reported to correlate with increased il-1beta expression by monocytes in response to bacterial stimulants. in the present study, we determined if pst positive subjects with periodontitis exhibit elevated production of il-1beta, compared to  pst negative periodontitis patients. peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from 10 pst+ and 10 pst- age- and disease-balanced subjects with adult forms of periodontitis. monocytes were cultured with a panel of bacterial stimulants, including escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis lps, and whole formalinized periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and prevotella intermedia, and health-associated organisms veillonella parvula and streptococcus sanguis. our results demonstrate that monocytes from pst+ and pst-  patients showed no significant differences in il-1beta production in response to  any stimulant tested. in addition, the periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. intermedia failed to stimulate higher il-1beta responses compared to health-associated species v. parvula and s. sanguis. a marked interindividual variation in production of il-1beta was seen, with high, low and  intermediate responders present in both pst+ and pst- groups. we conclude that genetic loci other than the pst polymorphisms are also important regulators of monocyte il-1 responses.

AB  == background: with an increasing body of data suggesting an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, studies have been conducted to elucidate potential mechanisms by which oral bacteria might exert systemic effects. 2 oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis, have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. this study was conducted to determine the effect of treatment with an essential oil mouthrinse (listerine  antiseptic) on the platelet-aggregating activity of these organisms. method: bacteria were grown under standard culture conditions. s. sanguis atcc strain 10556 was exposed for 3 min to the essential oil mouthrinse at either full strength or a 1:1 dilution, while p. gingivalis fdc strain 381 was exposed to the essential oil mouthrinse at a 1:10 dilution. positive control cells were treated  with hanks balanced salt solution (hbss). aggregation was measured using a recording platelet aggregometer. the assay of each organism in its respective mouthrinse dilution(s) or hbss was repeated 5 times. results: in all cases, the hbss-treated organisms induced platelet aggregation, with mean(+/-s.e.) lag times of 12.30 (+/-1.36) min and 11.36 (+/-0.58) min for p. gingivalis and s. sanguis,  respectively. in contrast, treatment with the essential oil mouthrinse completely inhibited the platelet aggregating activity of p. gingivalis and of s. sanguis exposed to the 1:1 mouthrinse dilution in all assays; the aggregating activity of s. sanguis treated with full-strength mouthrinse was completely inhibited in 4 of 5 assays, and inhibited by 75% in the 5th, for a mean inhibition of 95 +/- 1.5%.  conclusion: this study provides additional evidence that the essential oil mouthrinse can interfere with bacterial cell surface-associated activities which  may have clinical relevance.

AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  == accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. in subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from gram-negative bacteria increases. as the gingival junctional epithelium (je) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of ltas (from streptococcus mutans and s. sanguis) and lpss (from  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (hacat and erm) and  a culture model for human je. the cells were exposed to the ltas or lpss (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. none of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the je cultures. however, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in  all cultures treated with ltas. in contrast, lpss showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. this suggests that lpss, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. however, the ltas appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal je and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == synthesis, microbicidal activity, and solution structure of the dodecapeptide from bovine neutrophils.
AB  == the dodecapepetide sequence r-l-c-r-i-v-v-i-r-v-c-r with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by cd and determined by two-dimensional (2d) nmr. the strains p. gingivalis (w50 and 381), a. actinomycetemcomitans (y4 and 67), s. gordonii (dl1), and s. mutans (gs5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microm concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. the weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the cd spectra of this peptide provides evidence for  the presence of a disulfide bridge. the negative n-pi* band at approximately 200  nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. the negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. the assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2d total correlated and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy. the temperature dependence of amide nh chemical shifts and (1)h-(2)h exchange effect on amide nh resonances indicate the involvement of amide nh groups of cys3, ile5, ile8, val10, and arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen  bonding. the coupling constant (j(nh-c(alpha)h)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear overhauser effects, and the results of restrained  structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications  provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type i (iii) beta-turn  involving ile5, val6, val7, and ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the n-terminal arg1, leu2, cys3, and val4 and the c-terminal arg9, val10, cys11,  and arg12 residues. the structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.

TI  == multiple infections in carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
AB  == background: chlamydia pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and recently, periodontal disease, have been associated with human atherosclerosis. porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus sanguis are major pathogens associated with periodontitis, a common chronic inflammatory condition in adults. investigators have found that these infectious agents may influence vascular cell functions by inducing thrombus formation, vascular cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell death. methods and results: the main purpose of our study was to investigate the relation between the presence of multiple infectious agents in human carotid endarterectomy specimens and pathoanatomic features of the corresponding carotid plaques. histologically, plaque rupture of the fibrous cap  and communication of the luminal thrombus with the central necrotic lipid core was seen in or at proximity to the macrophage-rich shoulder (unstable plaque region). thrombus within the lipid core without plaque rupture was occasionally found near the internal elastic lamina, associated with increased vascularity and lymphocytic infiltrate. apoptosis, as detected by both the immunohistochemical staining of apoptosis-related proteins and in situ labeling of internucleosomally degraded dna, was common in atherosclerotic plaques. immunostainings for c pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, p gingivalis, and s sanguis  were positive in the carotid plaques. from 1 to 4 organisms were found in the same specimen. the micro-organisms were immunolocalized in plaque shoulders and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, associated with ulcer and thrombus formation, and adjacent to areas of strong labeling for apoptotic bodies. conclusions: our data  provide evidence that multiple infectious agents may be found in atherosclerotic  plaques, and sometimes in the same specimen. the current study is the first to report the detection of 2 major odontopathogens, p gingivalis and s sanguis, in atherosclerotic plaques. the immunolocalization of these micro-organisms within unstable plaque regions and their association with plaque ulceration, thrombosis, and apoptosis in vascular cells are intriguing. multiple infectious agents may alter vascular cell function and provide a "trigger" for acute ischemic stroke events. further evidence from human studies and animal models will be needed.

AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == the importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  == cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization  of various oral bacterial species. bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an  important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. the properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance.  among others, porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. the fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kda fimbrillin proteins. dna sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fima) from nine strains of p. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fima, while retaining common  immunochemical specificities. p. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is  known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. fimbriae of prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. these fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface  and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.

TI  == bactericidal efficacy of carbon dioxide laser against bacteria-contaminated titanium implant and subsequent cellular adhesion to irradiated area.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to assess co2 laser ability to eliminate bacteria from titanium implant surfaces. the changes of the surface  structure, the rise in temperature, and the damage of connective tissue cells after laser irradiation were also considered. study design/materials and methods: streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis on titanium discs were irradiated by an expanded beam of co2 laser. surface alteration was observed by a light, and a scanning electron, microscope. temperature was measured with a thermograph. damage of fibroblastic (l-929) and osteoblastic (mc3t3-e1) cells outside the irradiation spot and adhesion of the cells to the irradiated area were also estimated. results: all the organisms (10(8)) of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis were killed by the irradiation at 286 j/cm2 and 245 j/cm2, respectively. furthermore, laser irradiation did not cause surface alteration, rise of temperature, serious damage of connective tissue cells located outside the irradiation spot, or inhibition of cell adhesion to the irradiated area. conclusion: co2 laser irradiation with expanded beam may be useful in removing bacterial contaminants from implant surface.

TI  == dental plaque, platelets, and cardiovascular diseases.
AB  == cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia, occur as a result of a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. during periodontitis, dental plaque microorganisms may disseminate through the blood to  infect the vascular endothelium and contribute to the occurrence of atherosclerosis and risk of myocardial ischemia and infarction. myocardial ischemia and infarction are often preceded by acute thromboembolic events. in an  in vitro model of thrombosis, certain dental plaque bacteria induce platelets to  aggregate. aggregation of platelets is induced by the platelet aggregation-associated protein [paapj expressed on plaque bacteria, including streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis. intravenous infusion of s. sanguis into rabbits has been shown previously to cause changes in the electrocardiogram (ecg), heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility. these changes are consistent with the occurrence of myocardial infarction. the ecg changes are now shown to begin within 30 seconds after infusion of paap+ s. sanguis, followed by alterations in blood pressure and respiratory rate. these changes occurred intermittently over a 30-minute period and changed within one heartbeat to a normal pattern and suddenly back to abnormal. intermittent ecg abnormalities were seen in 13 of 15 rabbits, including left axis deviation, st-segment depression, preventricular contractions, alternans, and bigemnia. dose-dependent thrombocytopenia, accumulation of 111indium-labeled platelets in the lungs, and tachypnea also occurred. no changes occurred with the paap- strain. the data indicated that papp+ s. sanguis interacts with circulating platelets, inducing thromboemboli to cause the pulmonary and cardiac abnormalities. during periodontitis, therefore, paap+ s. sanguis and p. gingivalis bacteremia may contribute to the chance of acute thromboembolic events.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

TI  == binaphthalenone glycosides from african chewing sticks, diospyros lycioides.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration  range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the  cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did  not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

AB  == the major outer membrane protein, foma, of the gram-negative human oral pathogen  fusobacterium nucleatum functions as a porin and is assumed to act as a receptor  protein in coaggregation with other oral pathogenic bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis. we describe here the cloning  of foma from f. nucleatum in e. coli. using pgem3zf(+), three recombinant plasmids were carrying parts of the foma gene, but none of these contained regions upstream of the coding sequence. from these plasmids a clone was constructed which contained the whole foma gene. the atcc 10953 foma gene was cloned under the phosphate limitation-inducible phoe promoter, using a vector derived from pacyc184. the protein was found to be incorporated into the outer membrane of the host in an apparently normal manner, as judged by heat-modifiability, trypsin-accessibility, and accessibility to antibodies to the protein in a whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the cloned foma was found to exhibit pore-forming activity.

TI  == the effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to human buccal epithelial cells in vitro.
AB  == the effect of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of candida albicans and c. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (bec) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. the filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the bec which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for  45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. the bec with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of c. albicans to bec; s. sanguis had no effect. both s. sanguis and s. salivarius suppressed adhesion of c. krusei to bec pre-exposed to three different bacterial  concentrations, although variable results were obtained with p. gingivalis and e. coli. significant differences in the relative adhesion of c. albicans and c. krusei to bec were also recorded. these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to bec is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the bec.

TI  == the effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to denture acrylic surfaces. an in vitro study.
AB  == the effect of four different species of oral bacteria (streptococci (x 2); escherichia; porphyromonas) on the adhesion of candida albicans and candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees c, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for e. coli-c. albicans and s. salivarius-c. albicans combinations. candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to s. sanguis and p. gingivalis, but not e. coli. there were also significant differences in relative adhesion between c. albicans and c. krusei. taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.

AB  == the expression of sialy-lewis(x) (sle(x); neu5ac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4) (fuc alpha 1-3) glcnac-r) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sle(x) monoclonal antibody snh-3 (mab snh-3; igm class). mab snh-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus pyogenes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. the negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sle(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. we propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sle(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events  leading to infective endocarditis.

TI  == characterization of inhibitory effects of suspected periodontopathogens on osteogenesis in vitro.
AB  == by using an in vitro bone-forming culture system, the chick periosteal osteogenesis (cpo) model, the direct effects on osteogenesis of sonicated extracts derived from oral bacteria were examined. both extracts from bacterial species having strong associations with periodontal diseases (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia, hereinafter referred to as suspected periodontopathogens) and extracts from species not correlated with periodontal disease (streptococcus sanguis, veillonella atypica, and prevotella denticola, hereinafter referred to as nonpathogenic bacteria) were tested. all bacterial cultures were grown under standard anaerobic culture conditions. sonicated bacterial extracts were prepared from the bacterial pellet. these were added in various proportions to the cpo cultures. parameters of osteogenesis, including alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium and p(i) accumulation, and collagen synthesis, were measured in 6-day-old cultures. compared with controls grown in the absence of bacterial products, osteogenesis was inhibited significantly in cultures treated with extracts derived from the suspected periodontopathogens. no osteogenic inhibition was observed in cultures treated with extracts from the nonpathogenic bacteria. these results suggest that the ability to inhibit osteogenesis in vitro may be a pathogenic property shared by a limited group of species. further characterization of the p. gingivalis extracts revealed that both proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous products, including lipopolysaccharide, were able to inhibit osteogenesis. p. gingivalis extract-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis in cpo cultures was blocked by indomethacin, implicating prostaglandins in the regulation of the bacterial effects. the bacterial extracts had either reversible or irreversible inhibitory effects on osteogenesis when added after differentiation or before/during differentiation of bone cells, respectively.

TI  == delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.

TI  == bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  == periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (jp), rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), and adult periodontitis (ap), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. these disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. the present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of pbmc of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. the ap group had a significantly lower production of il-1ra when stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) (p < 0.05). streptococcus sanguis (s.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of il-1 alpha and tnf alpha production in all groups. the rpp group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (mc) than the ap group (p < 0.05). additionally, jp patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (p < 0.05). in conclusion, il-1 alpha, tnf alpha, or il-6 production by peripheral blood mc after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. the results support the hypothesis that the cytokine il-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: rpp and ap. furthermore, elevated mc concentration in the rpp group compared to the ap group may be an important pathogenic feature in rpp.

TI  == oral bacterial attachment to titanium surfaces: a scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  == despite the wide use of dental implants, the understanding of the mechanism(s) of bacterial attachment to implant surfaces and of the factors that affect such attachment is limited. in this study, the attachment of oral bacteria--including  streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis--to titanium (ti) discs with different surface morphology (smooth, grooved, or rough) was examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the most bacterial attachment was observed on the rough bsa-coated ti surfaces. the smooth surfaces promoted poor attachment for s. sanguis and a. viscosus. however, p. gingivalis attached equally well to both the smooth and grooved coated ti surfaces, based on direct cell quantitation and examination with sem. cell-surface fimbriae (which may play a role in adhesion) of both a. viscosus and p. gingivalis observed were associated with the ti surfaces. ti implant surface characteristics appeared to influence oral bacterial attachment in vitro. the in vitro attachment system has  proven its usefulness for future bacterial attachment studies with model implant  surfaces.

TI  == effect of binding of fibrinogen to each bacterium on coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis.
AB  == fibrinogen inhibits the coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis. in this study, we determined which bacterium interacts with fibrinogen in this inhibitory process. although preincubation of each bacterium with fibrinogen did not inhibit coaggregation, its activity was completely eliminated by the addition of protease inhibitors such as n-ethylmaleimide (nem), p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate and n alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone  to the preincubation mixture with fibrinogen and p. gingivalis. however, the inhibition of coaggregation was not found after preincubation of s. oralis with fibrinogen in the presence or absence of the protease inhibitors. labelled materials were recovered from the extract of p. gingivalis cells incubated with radioiodinated fibrinogen in the presence of nem but not in the absence of nem. in the binding experiment, p. gingivalis showed a much higher binding activity to fibrinogen than s. oralis. these findings suggest that fibrinogen and its fragment(s) may mask directly or indirectly the aggregation site with s. oralis on the p. gingivalis cells in its inhibitory process of coaggregation.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) by flow cytometry (fcm) using a monoclonal antibody (mab) omr-bg1e directed to p. gingivalis-specific lipopolysaccharide (lps). the p. gingivalis strains atcc 33277, 381, eso75, w50, and a7a1 were selected for the study. fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia), campylobacter rectus (c. rectus), streptococcus sanguis (s. sanguis) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans) served as controls. a suspension of 10(7) bacteria/ml of each bacteria was prepared and then reacted with a p. gingivalis specific mab omr-bg1e and fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) labeled second antibody. these samples were analyzed by fcm. bacterial specific binding aggregate on data was separated out by the forward- and side-angle-scatter characteristics, while non-specific binding (nsb) was eliminated by excluding the region with mouse igg-positive and second antibody-positive area. fcm detected a mean range of 56.2% to 97.2% p. gingivalis strains. there was a 5.1% non-specific binding using fcm to non-p. gingivalis strains. when the p. gingivalis concentration was adjusted to 10(2), 10(4), and 10(6) bacteria/ml, a detection rate of 35.7%, 48.1%, and 91.4%, was respectively  observed. the lower sensitivity of the flow cytometric assay was 10(2) bacteria/ml. when p. gingivalis was added to p. intermedia suspension at 1, 20, 40, 60, and 80%, the mab-positive fraction yielded by fcm displayed a coefficient of determination of 0.967 with the actual percentage of p. gingivalis and could be regressed to a linear function.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == short-term microbiological and clinical effects of subgingival irrigation with an antimicrobial mouthrinse.
AB  == fifty chronic adult periodontitis patients completed a 6-week controlled, double-blind, split mouth clinical study to determine the effects of subgingival  irrigation with an antimicrobial mouthrinse on periodontal microflora, supragingival plaque, and gingivitis when used as an adjunct to normal oral hygiene. qualifying subjects had at least four sites, two on each side of the mouth, with probing depths between 4 and 6 mm, which bled on gentle probing. following baseline examinations, subjects received a half mouth scaling and prophylaxis and full mouth subgingival irrigation with either the antimicrobial mouthrinse or sterile colored water control professionally delivered. subjects continued irrigation at home once daily for 42 days with their assigned rinse delivered via a subgingival delivery system. all sites in the mouth were scored at baseline and at day 42 for supragingival plaque, bleeding on probing, and redness. for the four selected periodontitis sites, probing depth and attachment  level were measured at baseline and on day 42; additionally, supragingival plaque and gingival redness were scored on days 7 and 21. subgingival plaque samples for microbiological analysis were harvested from the selected periodontal sites at baseline and on days 7, 21, and 42. microbiologically, irrigation with the antimicrobial mouthrinse resulted in statistically significant reductions compared to control in putative periodontopathogens, including black pigmenting species, which persisted at 42 days. clinically, subgingival irrigation with the  antimicrobial mouthrinse produced a significant reduction in supragingival plaque (p < 0.001), bleeding on probing (p = 0.019), and redness (p = 0.017) compared to the control, whether or not the area irrigated received a prophylaxis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == involvement of porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae in adherence to streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to early plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus gordonii, is considered an important colonization mechanism. the molecules that mediate this interspecies binding have not been determined. fimbriae were prepared from p. gingivalis 33277 by mild agitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation and deae-sepharose chromatography. in a nitrocellulose blot adherence assay, purified fimbriae inhibited s. gordonii g9b-p. gingivalis 33277  binding by up to 54%. in addition, fimbriae bound to s. gordonii cells in a dot-blot assay. incubation of fimbriae with s. gordonii cells followed by washing, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), electroblotting and probing with p. gingivalis antibodies also revealed that the  fimbriae bind to s. gordonii. in contrast, s. gordonii did not interact with fimbriae that were first subjected to sds-page and electroblotting or deposited on a nitrocellulose membrane, suggesting that conformational determinants of the  fimbriae may be important in binding. the results indicate that binding between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii is mediated, at least in part, by the porphyromonads' fimbriae.

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

AB  == twenty-eight young, healthy adults completed an experimental gingivitis study in  which blood and clinical recordings were obtained at baseline; after a 4-week period of thorough oral hygiene; after a subsequent 3-week period of plaque accumulation; and after another 2 weeks of thorough oral hygiene. serum immunoglobulin g antibodies against whole cells of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mean serum immunoglobulin g antibody levels to p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and s. sanguis remained essentially constant during the experiment, whereas the immunoglobulin g antibodies to p. gingivalis declined during the initial period of oral hygiene and the subsequent period of plaque accumulation to an average of 84.5% of the baseline value. this reduction could be attributed to the people who developed marked gingival inflammation during the period of plaque accumulation, indicating that the systemic host response may be associated with local tissue responses to  variations in oral hygiene. these people were, however, also characterized by higher initial serum immunoglobulin g responses to p. gingivalis than people who  developed less pronounced gingival inflammation during the experiment. the variability and individuality noted in the host response to potential pathogens have important implications for attempts to use such measures for establishing a  diagnosis or prognosis for the individual patient.

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

AB  == adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis deposited on nitrocellulose paper was investigated. a variety of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of p. gingivalis bound to both s. sanguis and s. mitis. binding of p. gingivalis to all but one of the streptococci was not inhibited by salivary molecules. pretreatment of p. gingivalis with periodate and pretreatment of s. sanguis and s. mitis with pronase decreased binding, suggesting that adherence may be mediated by a protein on the streptococci interacting with a carbohydrate on p. gingivalis. binding was not inhibited by a selection of simple sugars. the ability to adhere to early plaque  bacteria such as s. sanguis and s. mitis may be important in the colonization of  the mouth by p. gingivalis.

TI  == subgingival temperature (iii). relation to microbial counts.
AB  == the present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. at each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species  detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. species enumerated were; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, p.  micros, s. intermedius, s. sanguis i and ii, v. parvula and w. recta. total viable counts and counts of capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the  primary isolation plates. a total of 1581 samples were evaluated. subject visits  with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of b.  intermedius i and p. micros, and lower mean %s of capnocytophaga sp. sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of b. intermedius i and  ii, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and b. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often  at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. the 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microbiology of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics.
AB  == a group of poorly-controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) patients  were examined in a cross-sectional design for total microbial levels, microbial incidence, and the percent levels of selected periodontal microorganisms. these organisms were selected on the basis of prior reports that associated them with either periodontal disease or health. one periodontally-healthy and one periodontally-diseased site were examined in each iddm patient. increased levels  of the periodontal pathogens prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica spp., bacteroides gracilis, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus (formerly wolinella recta) were found at the periodontal diseased sites. increased prevalence of the organisms p. intermedia, p. melaninogenica spp., and c. rectus were found at the diseased sites. a significantly higher percentage of p. intermedia was found at the sites exhibiting deep pockets and attachment loss.

TI  == the use of dna probes to examine the distribution of subgingival species in subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction.
AB  == the present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. the mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). the probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. the % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; v. parvula, 98; b. intermedius i, 98; s. sanguis ii, 96; b. intermedius ii, 95; c. ochracea, 94; b. gingivalis, 91; s. sanguis i, 85; w. recta, 83; f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; s. intermedius, 80; b. forsythus, 76; p. micros, 74; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and  a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. the % of sites colonized by each of the  14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. the median number  of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for v. parvula. in half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than  4%. when subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == relation of counts of microbial species to clinical status at the sampled site.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to relate clinical characteristics at a site to the frequency of detection, absolute counts and proportions of 14 subgingival species. subgingival plaque samples were removed by curette from the  mesial surface of 2299 teeth in 3 healthy and 87 subjects with periodontal attachment loss. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to identify colonies of each test species. measurements of pocket depth, attachment level, recession, redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration were made at each sampled site. total viable  counts at sites ranged from 10(3) to greater than 10(8) and were strongly related to pocket depth. mean total counts at sites less than 3 mm averaged 4.6 x 10(6),  while mean counts at sites greater than 7 mm averaged 2.0 x 10(7). species enumerated and % of sites colonized were as follows; v. parvula 44; s. sanguis ii 36; b. intermedius i 33; c. ochracea 31; b. intermedius ii 30; s. sanguis i 29; b. gingivalis 27; s. intermedius 25; p. micros 24; w. recta 23; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 18; b. forsythus 15; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 10; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 8. counts of b. intermedius ii were higher at sites which exhibited gingival redness while b. intermedius i was higher at sites which bled on probing. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b was more frequent and  at higher mean % at sites without recession. the opposite was true for s. sanguis ii. b. gingivalis was somewhat more prevalent and at higher levels at suppurating sites. b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii and b. forsythus were found more frequently and at higher levels at sites with deeper pockets, while v. parvula was less prevalent at sites with pocket depths less than 4 mm. b. gingivalis, b.  intermedius i and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b increased with increasing pocket depth in both localized and widespread disease subjects, but mean counts were higher in the localized disease subjects at any pocket depth. only w. recta  was found at higher levels at deep sites in widespread disease subjects when compared with similar sites in localized disease subjects. no suspected pathogens were detected in 38% of shallow sites, 31% of intermediate sites and 22% of deep  sites, 2/3 of deep pockets, but less than 1/2 of shallow pockets harbored at least 2 of the suspected pathogens.

TI  == relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  == the relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. a subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using gracey curettes. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17  of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. the % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. the species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the  active and inactive subjects were as follows; b gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; w. recta 1.3, 0.6; b. intermedius i 2.5, 2.0; b. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; s. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; p. micros 1.5, 1.5; b. intermedius ii 1.6, 1.7; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; s. sanguis i 1.8, 2.1; s. sanguis ii 2.7, 3.0; v. parvula 3.9, 4.2; c. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == adherence of porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis to streptococcus sanguis in vitro.
AB  == intergeneric bacterial adherence is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to enable some extraneous bacteria to initially colonize the human oral cavity. some current evidence indicates that streptococcus sanguis, an early colonizer of teeth, enhances subsequent colonization by porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, a bacterium associated with advanced adult periodontitis. in this study, selected strains of  p. gingivalis and s. sanguis were tested for their adherence activities in vitro. a differential filtration assay was devised in which one member of the test pair  was radiolabeled. heterogeneous aggregates that formed in mixed suspensions were  collected on polycarbonate filters (8-microns pore size) and were washed free of  individual bacteria and small homologous clumps. p. gingivalis 381, w50, jkg7, and 33277 adhered to s. sanguis g9b, m5, challis 6, and 38. p. gingivalis a7a1-28 did not adhere well to s. sanguis under these conditions. more precise measurements of intergeneric adherence were obtained with an alternative assay with radiolabeled p. gingivalis and an artificial dental plaque composed of s. sanguis coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose beads. cnbr-agarose was selected as the supporting matrix for the plaque because it was uniformly and permanently coated with s. sanguis and because p. gingivalis had negligible adherence activity for streptococcus-free beads. p. gingivalis w50 grown to the early stationary phase adhered to s. sanguis-coated beads in higher numbers than  either midlogarithmic- or late-stationary-phase cells. intergeneric adherence was not inhibited or reversed by the presence of lactose or other monosaccharides or  disaccharides. pretreatment of either bacterium with trypsin or proteinase k reduced subsequent adherence by 86 to 100%. neuraminidase treatment of p. gingivalis caused 98% reduction of adherence, whereas similar treatment of s. sanguis caused only a 2% loss. preincubation of p. gingivalis at 60 degrees c for 30 min decreased subsequent adherence to s. sanguis-coated beads by 94%. adherence was reduced by 96% when bacteria were assayed while suspended in human  whole saliva or when pretreated with saliva and subsequently assayed in buffer. the concentration of whole human saliva required to inhibit 50% adherence in this assay was 23 micrograms per ml (1:200 dilution). suspension of the bacteria in normal rabbit serum resulted in 94% inhibition of adherence. these data indicate  that saliva and serum may be important host defense factors for controlling porphyromonas-streptococcus adherence.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == [ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro].
AB  == this study was designed to analyze the succession of an ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro. bacterial strains used in this study, were fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, porphyromonas gingivalis 381, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mutans omz 176. the bacterial  cells, associated with beneficial, pathogenic or plaque forming activity, were cultured in brain heart infusion medium including hemin, vitamin-k1, l-cysteine hydrochloride and sodium thioglycollate under anaerobic condition (n2: 80%, co2:  10%, h2: 10%). the effect of environmental eh and ph on the growth of bacterial cells was investigated in single and mixed culture, and eh and ph tolerance tests were also undertaken. the environmental ph decreased from ph 7.0 to ph 4.9 accompanied with the growth of s. mutans omz 176 and s. sanguis atcc 10557 in both single and mixed culture. the environmental eh increased from -308 mv to -180 mv accompanied with the growth of s. sanguis atcc 10557. the growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis 381, varied markedly with eh and ph. especially, the growth of p. gingivalis 381 was severely inhibited at or below ph 6.0 in an acid tolerance test, whereas the growth of f. nucleatum atcc 10953 was strongly inhibited at eh -100 mv in an eh tolerance test. the oxygen generation (10.8%) was confirmed in the anaerobic culture of s. sanguis atcc 10557. therefore, it was suggested that hydrogen peroxide produced by s. sanguis atcc 10557 was reduced to oxygen and water. these results suggest that the high eh and the low ph generated from bacterial metabolism is a powerful determinant in ecology of microbial flora in periodontal pockets.
