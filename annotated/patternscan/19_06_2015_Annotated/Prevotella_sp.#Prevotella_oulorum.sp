TI  == bacterial community development in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == current knowledge of the microbial composition of dental plaque in early gingivitis is based largely on microscopy and cultural methods, which do not provide a comprehensive description of oral microbial communities. this study used 454-pyrosequencing of the v1-v3 region of 16s rrna genes (approximately 500  bp), and bacterial culture, to characterize the composition of plaque during the  transition from periodontal health to gingivitis. a total of 20 healthy volunteers abstained from oral hygiene for two weeks, allowing plaque to accumulate and gingivitis to develop. plaque samples were analyzed at baseline, and after one and two weeks. in addition, plaque samples from 20 chronic periodontitis patients were analyzed for cross-sectional comparison to the experimental gingivitis cohort. all of the healthy volunteers developed gingivitis after two weeks. pyrosequencing yielded a final total of 344,267 sequences after filtering, with a mean length of 354 bases, that were clustered into an average of 299 species-level operational taxonomic units (otus) per sample. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots revealed significant shifts in the bacterial community structure of plaque as gingivitis was induced, and community diversity increased significantly after two weeks. changes in the relative abundance of otus during the transition from health to gingivitis were correlated to bleeding on probing (bop) scores and resulted in the identification of new health- and gingivitis-associated taxa. comparison of the healthy volunteers to the periodontitis patients also confirmed the association of a number of putative periodontal pathogens with chronic periodontitis. taxa associated with gingivitis included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, lachnospiraceae [g-2] sp. hot100, lautropia sp. hota94, and prevotella oulorum, whilst rothia dentocariosa was associated with periodontal health. further study  of these taxa is warranted and may lead to new therapeutic approaches to prevent  periodontal disease.

TI  == prevotella paludivivens sp. nov., a novel strictly anaerobic, gram-negative, hemicellulose-decomposing bacterium isolated from plant residue and rice roots in irrigated rice-field soil.
AB  == two strictly anaerobic bacterial strains, kb7(t) and a42, were isolated from rice plant residue and living rice roots, respectively, from irrigated rice-field soil in japan. these two strains were closely related to each other with 16s rrna gene sequence similarity of 99.8 %. both strains showed almost the same physiological  properties. cells were gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming rods. growth  was remarkably stimulated by the addition of haemin to the medium. the strains utilized various saccharides including xylan, xylose, pectin and carboxymethylcellulose and produced acetate and succinate with small amounts of formate and malate. the strains grew at 10-40 degrees c; optimum growth was observed at 30 degrees c and ph 5.7-6.7. oxidase, catalase and nitrate-reducing activities were not detected. aesculin was hydrolysed. the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c(15 : 0), iso-c(15 : 0), c(15 : 0) and iso-c(17 : 0) 3-oh. menaquinones mk-11 and mk-11(h(2)) were the major respiratory quinones and the genomic dna g+c content was 39.2 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences placed both strains in the phylum bacteroidetes. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that the most related species to both strains was prevotella oulorum (92.8-92.9 % similarity). prevotella veroralis and prevotella  melaninogenica were the next most closely related known species with sequence similarities of 91.9-92.4 %. based on differences in the phylogenetic, ecological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics between the two isolates and related species, it is proposed that strains kb7(t) and a42 represent a novel species, prevotella paludivivens sp. nov. this is the first described prevotella species derived from a natural habitat; all other prevotella species are from mammalian sources. the type strain of prevotella paludivivens is kb7(t) (=jcm 13650(t)=dsm 17968(t)).

TI  == xylanibacter oryzae gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel strictly anaerobic, gram-negative, xylanolytic bacterium isolated from rice-plant residue in flooded  rice-field soil in japan.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic, xylanolytic bacterium, strain kb3(t), isolated from rice-plant residue in flooded anoxic rice-field soil in japan, was characterized  phenotypically and phylogenetically. cells were gram-negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, short to filamentous rods. growth of the strain was remarkably stimulated by the addition of haemin to the medium. the novel strain utilized various sugars including xylan, xylose, pectin and carboxymethylcellulose and produced acetate, propionate and succinate with a small amount of malate. propionate production was stimulated by the addition of a b-vitamin mixture or cobalamin to the medium. the novel strain was slightly acidophilic with an optimum ph 5.7-6.2 and the optimum growth temperature was 30 degrees c. oxidase,  catalase and nitrate-reducing activities were negative. aesculin was hydrolysed.  the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c(15 : 0) and iso-3-oh c(17 : 0). the major respiratory quinones were menaquinones mk-12(h(2)) and mk-13(h(2)). the genomic dna g+c content was 43.6 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequence placed the strain in the phylum bacteroidetes. the closest related  species was prevotella bivia with a 16s rrna gene sequence similarity of 89.5 %.  prevotella albensis and prevotella oulorum were the next closest recognized species with sequence similarities of 89.1 %. based on a comprehensive examination of the differences in phylogenetic, ecological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain kb3(t) and those of related species, a novel genus and species, xylanibacter oryzae gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed to  accommodate strain kb3(t). the type strain of the novel species is kb3(t) (=jcm 13648(t)=dsm 17970(t)).
