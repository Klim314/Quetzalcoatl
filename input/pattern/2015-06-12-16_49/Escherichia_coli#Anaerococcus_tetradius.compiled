TI  - Evolution for exogenous octanoic acid tolerance improves carboxylic acid production and membrane integrity.
AB  - Carboxylic acids are an attractive biorenewable chemical, but as with many biorenewables, their toxicity to microbial biocatalysts limits their fermentative production. While it is generally accepted that membrane damage is the main mechanism of fatty acid toxicity, previous metabolic engineering efforts that increased membrane integrity did not enable increased carboxylic acid production. Here we used an evolutionary approach to improve tolerance to exogenous octanoic acid, with the goal of learning design strategies from this evolved strain. This evolution of an Escherichia coli MG1655 derivative at neutral pH in minimal media produced a strain with increased tolerance not only to octanoic acid, but also to hexanoic acid, decanoic acid, n-butanol and isobutanol. This evolved strain also produced carboxylic acids at a 5-fold higher titer than its parent strain when expressing the Anaerococcus tetradius thioesterase. While it has been previously suggested that intracellular acidification may contribute to carboxylic acid toxicity, we saw no evidence that the evolved strain has increased resistance to this acidification. Characterization of the evolved strain membrane showed that it had significantly altered membrane polarization (fluidity), integrity (leakage) and composition relative to its parent. The changes in membrane composition included a significant increase in average lipid length in a variety of growth conditions, including 30 degrees C, 42 degrees C, carboxylic acid challenge and ethanol challenge. The evolved strain has a more dynamic membrane composition, showing both a larger number of significant changes and larger fold changes in the relative abundance of membrane lipids. These results highlight the importance of the cell membrane in increasing microbial tolerance and production of biorenewable fuels and chemicals.
TI  - Modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  - At high altitude (HA) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (GI) disorder are very common phenomena. To explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the GI functions, were subjected following simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. For this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kPa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. It was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and Escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. The population density of strict anaerobes like Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (GDI). In relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of IgA and IgG increased in duration dependent manner. The activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. Besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered GSH/GSSG pool in the intestinal epithelia. Histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. It can be concluded that hypoxia at HA modified GI microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small intestinal dysfunction at HA.

TI  - Microbiology and antibiotic sensitivity of head and neck space infections of odontogenic origin.
AB  - This paper aim to assess the anatomical spaces of head and neck region and causative microorganisms responsible for infections, evaluate the resistance of antibiotics used in treatment and compare the findings with previously reported microbial flora in the orofacial infection. Forty-two patients were recorded. All underwent surgical incision and drainage, received antibiotics cover, and had culture and sensitivity test performed for gram positive and gram negative aerobes. There were 33 male (78.57 %) and 9 female (21.42 %). Out of the 42 patients 28 (66.66 %) presented with single space involvement. The submandibular space was the most frequent location for single space abscess (28.12 %). Fourteen patients presented with multiple space involvement, with a total of 64 spaces being involved. Forty microorganisms were isolated. There were 28 aerobes and 10 anaerobes. Two fungi were also identified. The most common bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus. The key issue here, which needs to be remembered, is that antibiotics alone cannot resolve odontogenic infection satisfactorily. Quick recovery of patients results with proper basic management comprising of early drainage/decompression which is equally important.
TI  - Alteration of predominant gastrointestinal flora and oxidative damage of large intestine under simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  - Hypobaric hypoxia is an immediate and crucial starting mechanism of acute mountain sickness included with some non-specific gastrointestinal (GI) complications. To study the effect of hypoxia on GI microflora and its upshot to this system, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kPa (air pressure ~ 4872.9 m altitude) consecutively 30 days for 8 hours/day. The different indicator group of large intestinal microbial populations were enumerated and correlated with the levels of antioxidant indicators like catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) of large intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, the histological study was performed by haematoxylin eosin (HE), periodic acid schiff staining (PAS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was observed that the density of total aerobes (104 folds) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased but the population of total anaerobes (209 folds) and Escherichia coli (125 folds) elevated after 30 days of hypoxic stress. The strict anaerobes like Bifidobacterium spp. (3 folds), Bacteroides spp. (134 folds), Lactobacillus spp. (7 folds) and other selected obligate anaerobes like Clostridium perfringens (40 folds), Peptostreptococcus spp. (21 folds) increased in respect to their control population. The growth direction index (GDI) of anaerobic populations was positive and correlated with gas formation aptitude. The activities of CAT and SOD in the large intestinal epithelia decreased significantly (p < 0.05) and GSH/GSSG pool turned into oxidized state with higher MDA (p < 0.05) formation. Histological study revealed the necrotized epithelial layer with higher lymphocytes infiltration in lamina propia accompanied by reduction of acidic mucins secreting goblet cells. From this experiment, it can be hypothesized that high altitude induced hypoxia manipulated the bacterial imprint and damaged the epithelial barrier of the large intestine which may cause systemic infection.
TI  - In vivo proton MR spectroscopy in uterine abscesses.
AB  - It is important to make a rapid diagnosis to provide appropriate treatment, however, specific diagnosis of causative organisms of pelvic abscesses on conventional MR imaging is difficult. MR spectroscopy provides metabolic information noninvasively, and has the potential to characterize etiology of the abscesses. The presence of acetate (Ac) peak with or without succinate (Suc) peak may suggest anaerobic bacterial infection, whereas the absence of Ac and Suc peaks in the spectra may suggest aerobic infection. This report describes two cases of uterine pyogenic abscesses, which showed Ac and Suc peaks on in vivo MR spectroscopy.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of microbial biofilms in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to identify the bacterial spectra on the surface of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) in comparison to oral mucosa of patients with a higher risk to emerge an OSCC and a control group to determine their susceptibility to various common antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Swabs from 90 patients, 30 patients of each group, were cultured on media for aerobes and anaerobes and tested with agar diffusion and Etest. RESULTS: The predominant pathogens of the normal healthy oral mucosa were aerobes. The ratio between aerobes and anaerobes was 2:1, balanced in risk patients and inverted in the OSCC group. Altogether, 1,006 isolates were cultured. The most frequent strains were 47 viridans streptococci, 30 Staphylococcus species, 14 Enterococcus faecalis, 36 Neisseria species, 14 Escherichia coli, and 23 other aerobes, 66 Peptostreptococcus species, 39 Fusobacterium species, and 34 Prevotella species. The resistance rates in the OSCC group were penicillin 40%, ampicillin 57%, doxycycline 23%, clindamycin 47%, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 20%, but up to 100% of pathogens were susceptible to azithromycin, telithromycin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative anaerobes play a decisive role in the development of postoperative infections in patients with OSCC. This tumor special type of colonization does not agree with the normal flora of the oral cavity. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Biofilms on OSCC surfaces provide an important reservoir for anaerobic bacteria. As a consequence, a proposal for an antibiotic prophylactic regime should be given.
TI  - Regioselective covalent immobilization of recombinant antibody-binding proteins A, G, and L for construction of antibody arrays.
AB  - Immobilized antibodies are useful for the detection of antigens in highly sensitive microarray diagnostic applications. Arrays with the antibodies attached regioselectively in a uniform orientation are typically more sensitive than those with random orientations. Direct regioselective immobilization of antibodies on a solid support typically requires a modified form of the protein. We now report a general approach for the regioselective attachment of antibodies to a surface using truncated forms of antibody-binding proteins A, G, and L that retain the structural motifs required for antibody binding. The recombinant proteins have a C-terminal CVIX protein farnesyltransferase recognition motif that allows us to append a bioorthogonal azide or alkyne moiety and use the Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition to attach the binding proteins to a suitably modified glass surface. This approach offers several advantages. The recombinant antibody-binding proteins are produced in Escherichia coli, chemoselectively modified posttranslationally in the cell-free homogenate, and directly attached to the glass surface without the need for purification at any stage of the process. Complexes between immobilized recombinant proteins A, G, and L and their respective strongly bound antibodies were stable to repeated washing with PBST buffer at pH 7.2. However, the antibodies could be stripped from the slides by treatment with 0.1 M glycine.HCl buffer, pH 2.6, for 30 min and regenerated by shaking with PBS buffer, pH 7.2, at 4 degrees C overnight. The recombinant forms of proteins A, G, and L can be used separately or in combination to give glass surfaces capable of binding a wide variety of antibodies.
TI  - Microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  - Sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (SSI). The present investigation characterized microbial recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (AB) and nonabsorbable (NAB) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. AB and NAB sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. At explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. Suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. A significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (P < 0.05) was noted. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected devices. No significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. Biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (P < 0.042). We conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. Further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.
TI  - Primary retroperitoneal abscess caused by Candida glabrata.
AB  - Clinically, retroperitoneal abscesses present insidiously and the diagnosis may be delayed. This, with inadequate drainage, may result in increased morbidity and mortality. Most cases result from a renal or gastrointestinal process, but in a small number of patients there is no identifiable source and the abscess is designated as "primary." Most retroperitoneal abscesses are polymicrobial, and cultures often reveal organisms such as Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus species, Peptostreptococcus, Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides species. Fungal causes appear to be very rare, and in this study, a case of a patient with primary Candida glabrata retroperitoneal abscess is reported.
TI  - Evaluation of impact of exposure of Sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. In this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on 11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. Among the tested bacteria, cell growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red, respectively. At the tested concentration of 100 muM, Sudan I and II inhibited growth of Clostridium perfringens and Lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. Sudan II also affected growth of Enterococcus faecalis. Growth of Bifidobacterium catenulatum, C. perfringens, E. faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by Sudan III and IV with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. C. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by Para Red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-Amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. However, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. The dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. Clostridium indolis and Clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of Sudan azo dyes. The present results suggested that Sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis caused by a primary appendicocutaneous fistula.
AB  - We report a case of necrotizing fasciitis in the loin of a 76-year old man with several coexisting or past health issues, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, alcohol-related liver cirrhosis, gastrectomy for gastric cancer, subarachnoid hemorrhage, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and cerebral infarction. Incision of the necrotizing fasciitis was successful, but it revealed an appendicocutaneous fistula; thus, we performed appendectomy and fistulectomy. We think that the necrotizing fasciitis was caused by appendicitis perforation involving the retroperitoneum, inducing the formation of an appendicocutaneous fistula. Necrotizing fasciitis and appendicocutaneous fistulae are rare complications of appendicitis. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first report of fluoroscopic examination demonstrating that a primary appendicocutaneous fistula had caused necrotizing fasciitis. Our search of the literature found 12 cases of necrotizing fasciitis caused by preoperative appendicitis. We discuss the characteristics and findings of these cases.
TI  - Appendicitis: When there is more than meets the eye.
AB  - Acute appendicitis is the most frequent emergency in gastrointestinal surgery. Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen appears to be one of the most common physiologic mechanisms for the development of acute appendicitis. Once obstructed, the dilatation of the lumen causes ischemia and necrosis of the wall. The most common organisms involved in appendicitis are Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus, Bacillus fragilis and Pseudomonas. Rarely, Actinomyces is involved in this process. In this case report, we report a case of actinomycosis of the appendix vermiformis occurring in a 19-year-old male with no predisposing factors. Along with a review of the literature, we will define the risk factors, clinical characteristics, diagnostic methods, and treatment of actinomycosis.
TI  - Macromolecular crowding fails to fold a globular protein in cells.
AB  - Proteins perform their functions in cells where macromolecular solutes reach concentrations of >300 g/L and occupy >30% of the volume. The volume excluded by these macromolecules stabilizes globular proteins because the native state occupies less space than the denatured state. Theory predicts that crowding can increase the ratio of folded to unfolded protein by a factor of 100, amounting to 3 kcal/mol of stabilization at room temperature. We tested the idea that volume exclusion dominates the crowding effect in cells using a variant of protein L, a 7 kDa globular protein with seven lysine residues replaced by glutamic acids; 84% of the variant molecules populate the denatured state in dilute buffer at room temperature, compared with 0.1% for the wild-type protein. We then used in-cell NMR spectroscopy to show that the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli does not overcome even this modest ( approximately 1 kcal/mol) free-energy deficit. The data are consistent with the idea that nonspecific interactions between cytoplasmic components can overcome the excluded-volume effect. Evidence for these interactions is provided by the observations that adding simple salts folds the variant in dilute solution but increasing the salt concentration inside E. coli does not fold the protein. Our data are consistent with the results of other studies of protein stability in cells and suggest that stabilizing excluded-volume effects, which must be present under crowded conditions, can be ameliorated by nonspecific interactions between cytoplasmic components.
TI  - Sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. It is approved in Japan for use in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, other Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. Noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, C. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. Gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. Adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.
TI  - Evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  - In this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: M40 Transystem, Amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA, USA), and SSI transportmedium (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen Denmark). The CLSI M40-A standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. The transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. After 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms tested. SSI transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two Copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. In polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. At 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. The species most difficult to recover in all the three systems was Neisseria gonorrhoeae. When selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.
TI  - Efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees C.
AB  - An Amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees C. Nine American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic strains (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli ([ATCC 25922 and ATCC 11775], Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Lactobacillus casei). The bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal samples. There were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline and after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of P. anaerobius. For P. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. The tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.
TI  - Oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. However, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. AIM: To investigate the effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. Cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-kappaB activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial NF-kappaB activation and cytokine responses. An oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest IL-8 and TNF-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - [Identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  - Routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. This study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. One hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during March 20-October 30 2007, were included in the study. The specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to Wilkins Chalgren agar, Schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. Isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with API 20A panels (Bio-Merieux, France) via conventional methods and by the help of AN-IDENT Discs (Oxoid, England). Penicillin G, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with E- test method. Twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 Escherichia coli and 4 Enterococcus spp.) growth. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. The distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), Bacteroides spp. other than B.fragilis (n = 4), Clostridium spp. (n = 2), Fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), Prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), Peptococcus niger (n = 2), Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and Lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). Beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 B. fragilis isolates. All of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. The highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin G (9/22; 41%). While anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. Among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. The results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at Konya area in Turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.
TI  - Innate inflammatory responses of human decidual cells to periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontopathic bacteria exert potent proinflammatory effects in human decidua. STUDY DESIGN: The immunostimulatory effects of Gram-positive and negative periodontopathic bacteria and their lipopolysaccharides were tested in human decidual cell cultures in comparison with Escherichia coli. Cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; inflammatory gene expression was measured by oligonucleotide arrays and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All bacteria that were tested elicited an inflammatory response, although concentration-dependence and efficacy varied considerably with organism and culture. Lipopolysaccharides were more potent stimuli than intact bacterial cells, although bacteria exerted greater effects at high concentrations. Of 112 genes on the arrays, 18 genes were stimulated significantly by one or more lipopolysaccharide preparation. CONCLUSION: The ability of periodontopathic bacteria to stimulate a decidual inflammatory response is highly variable and partly dependent on the presence and structure of constituent lipopolysaccharides. This adds to our understanding of the causal association between periodontal disease and preterm birth.
TI  - Notes on the microbiology of cholesteatoma: clinical findings and treatment.
AB  - Anomalous proliferation of the cholesteatoma epithelium is caused by extrinsic factors such as toxins or bacterial antigens combined with lytic enzymes, lymphokines and cytokines released from the inflammatory infiltrate. This could explain the close relationship between the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma and repeated bacterial superinfection, therefore it is very important to know the bacteria involved in order to control the regrowth of skin following surgery, reduce the aggressive potential of the cholesteatoma and limit the incidence of complications. This study focused on 70 females and 80 males aged between 15 and 65 years, affected by cholesteatomatous otitis media; all underwent bacteriological examination of the auricular secretion. The floral bacteria which proved to play the most important role (60.3%) were the aerobic type and the highest levels were those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (31.1%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (19.1%), Proteus mirabilis (7.7%), Escherichia coli (1.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). Anaerobic floral bacteria were found in a fairly high percentage of cases (38.2%); in particular, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (Peptococcus 12.4% and Peptostreptococcus in 4.8% of cases), Bacteroides (12.4%), Clostridium (3.8%), Fusobacterium (2.9%) and Propionobacterium (1.9%) were isolated. In 3 cases of mycetes (1.4%) only Aspergillus, in association with Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, was identified. The study showed, then, how effective second generation fluoroquinolones and third generation cephalosporins are (the latter being used in pre-adolescent children), the reason being that these antibiotics work not only on Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, but also on the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and DNA-DNA hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (ORN). The purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible after radiation therapy. DESIGN: Bacterial DNA was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified, cloned, transformed into Escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. RESULTS: From the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. The predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were Campylobacter gracilis, Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone FG014, uncultured bacterium clone RL178, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella spp. The study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in ORN. In contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of ORN in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. To better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with ORN is necessary.

TI  - Maxillary sinusitis in patients ventilated for a severe head injury and with nostrils free of any foreign body.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to determine the frequency of maxillary sinusitis in  the patients with traumatic head injury and nostrils free of any foreign body. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography (US) for the detection of the presence of fluid in maxillary sinuses were evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with severe traumatic head injury were included in the study. The patients who had displaced maxillary sinus fracture at the medial wall and naso-tracheal and/or naso-gastric tube were excluded. Paranasal computed tomography (CT) was performed along with the routine cranial CT scanning or in case of unknown source of infection and compared with the results of ultrasonographic examination of maxillary sinuses performed by a single radiologist who was unaware of the CT results. In the patients, who had clinical and radiological signs of sinusitis, a trans-nasal puncture was performed using sinoject (SinoJect, ATOS Medical, Sweden), a spring-activated puncture instrument, to take a sample for microbiologic examination and to drain maxillary sinuses. RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of the patients were tracheotomised on the fifth day (on average) of their intensive care unit (ICU) stay. The frequency of sinusitis in the study group was found to be 32.5% (13 patients). The most frequently isolated species were Pseudomonas spp. (37.5%), Escherichia coli (20.8%) and Peptostreptococcus (16.7%). Five of the aspirates were polymicrobial. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of B-mode US, compared with CT for the detection of fluid presence in maxillary sinuses in a 100 maxillary sinus examinations, were 92.2%, 81.6%, 83.9% and 90.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Maxillary sinusitis should be considered as a source of infection or sepsis in patients with traumatic head injury because of its high frequency. US is likely to be used as the first-line diagnostic tool for the determination of fluid in maxillary sinuses, especially in patients who do not require CT or cannot be transported to a radiology unit for CT.
TI  - Significance of cytomorphological and microbiological examination of bile collected by endoscopic cannulation of the papilla of vater.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bile analysis yields important information such as "biliary microlithiasis" and biliary tract colonization by microorganisms like Salmonella typhi or paratyphi, Escherichia coli, etc., which may progresses to cholelithiasis and have been found to have a role in the development of gallbladder cancer in India. AIM: To perform microscopic, cytomorphological and microbiological examination of bile collected during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with benign and malignant lesions of the gallbladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bile was collected from 48 patients by a catheter inserted through the cystic duct during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Direct microscopy and grading of crystals was performed. Smears prepared from centrifuged deposits were stained with Giemsa, Papanicolaou stain and Gram's stain for cytological and microbiological examination. Special staining for Helicobacter pylori was performed using Loeffler's Methylene blue and Warthin Starry stain. The rest of the sample was used for culture and complete microbiological examination. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients had inflammatory lesions while 12 had malignant lesions. Crystals were observed in 93% of the cases, 13 (28.8%) had only cholesterol crystals, three (6.6%) had bilirubinate and 29 (64.4%) had both cholesterol and bilirubinate crystals. Smears from the centrifuged deposit mainly showed coccoid or cocobacillary bacteria on Gram's staining (81.3%). Five of 12 (41.6%) malignant cases showed epithelial atypia while none of the benign or inflammatory lesions showed such a change in hematoxylin and eosin and Pap-stained smears. Microbiologic analysis showed Staphylococcus aureus (14%), S. saprophyticus (5.5%), Peptococcus (5.5%), Peptostreptococcus (5.5%), Proteus mirabilis (5.5%), E. coli (17%), Enteorbacter cloacae (5.5%) and H. pylori (2.8%). CONCLUSION: Complete microscopic and microbiological examination of bile directly obtained from the common bile duct during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography yielded good results as fresh samples could be analyzed. It may help in diagnosis of many gallbladder lesions in early stages, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality.
TI  - The bacteriology of salivary gland infections.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. However, infection of the salivary glands can occur in any of the glands. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial infection are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include: anaerobic Gram negative bacilli (eg, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas); Fusobacterium spp; and Peptostreptococcus spp. In addition, Streptococcus spp (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have been reported. Aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Haemophilus influenzae, Treponema pallidum, Bartonella henselae, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of infection. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by identification of the etiologic agent.
TI  - Sudan azo dyes and Para Red degradation by prevalent bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Sudan azo dyes have genotoxic effects and ingestion of food products contaminated with Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red could lead to exposure in the human gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we examined thirty-five prevalent species of human intestinal bacteria to evaluate their capacity to degrade Sudan dyes and Para Red. Among these tested bacterial strains, 23, 13, 33, 30, and 29 out of 35 species tested were able to reduce Sudan I, II, III, IV, and Para Red, respectively, to some extent. Bifidobacterium infantis, Clostridium indolis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Ruminococcus obeum were able to reduce completely all four tested Sudan dyes and Para Red. Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus magnus were the only two strains that were not able to reduce any of the tested Sudan dyes and Para Red to any significant extent. Metabolites of the reduction of the tested Sudan dyes and Para Red by E. faecalis were isolated and identified by HPLC and LC/ESI-MS analyses and compared with authentic standards. Thus it appears that the ability to reduce Sudan dyes and Para Red except Sudan II is common among bacteria in the human colon.
TI  - Clinical features and prognostic factors of anaerobic infections: a 7-year retrospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Risk factors for mortality resulting from anaerobic infection are incompletely defined. The clinical significance of a broad range of pathogenic obligate anaerobic organisms was examined, and factors independently associated with mortality were identified in patients with clinically significant anaerobic infections. METHODS: The medical records of 1,050 patients with anaerobic infections were retrospectively reviewed at Severance Hospital in Seoul, Korea. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 54.1+/-16.8 years, and 57.7% were men. Overall, 320 (30.5%) patients with case-defined illness experienced pain at the affected site, and 230 (21.9%) experienced pus flow from lesions. Ten (1.4%) patients presented with shock, and 80.3% of the clinically significant cases were polymicrobial anaerobic infections. The mean number of pathogens, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, was 3.7+/-1.0 (minimum 1, maximum 5), and the number of anaerobic organisms was 1.0+/-0.3 in each specimen. The major pathogens by rank were the Bacteroides fragilis group, which accounted for 41.8% of anaerobic infections, followed by Clostridium spp. (11.8%), Prevotella spp. (9.4%), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (8.4%). Escherichia coli (17.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%) were common concomitant aerobic organisms. The overall crude mortality rate resulting from anaerobic infection was 29.7%. Among the determining factors associated with mortality, liver disease (p=0.003) and old age (p=0.005) were significant in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic infection is polymicrobial and has a significant role in morbidity and mortality. Underlying liver disease was associated with poor prognosis in anaerobic infection.
TI  - [Diabetic foot infections. Prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity of the causative microorganisms].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foot infections are a common reason for hospitalization and a cause of complications in patients with diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of microorganisms found on culture in complicated diabetic foot infections in hospitalized patients, and the sensitivity of the causative microorganisms to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Between December 2001 and December 2005 in our department, 84 samples in 62 diabetic patients with moderate/severe infection were collected for microbiological study. RESULTS: At least one microorganism was isolated in 88% of samples. The most frequently isolated germ group was gram-positive bacteria (55% of the samples), with Staphylococcus aureus (33%) in the first position, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Enterococcus spp. (9%), and Escherichia coli (8%). Culture for anaerobic microorganisms was only performed in half the samples; 25% were positive, and Peptostreptococcus spp. predominated. Among the multiresistant microorganisms, methicillin-resistant staphylococci aureus (MRSA) were the most common, accounting for 38% of the isolated strains of S. aureus, ie, 12% of all samples. As to the gram-negative microorganisms, nearly 30% of E. coli strains were resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Most of the cultures in our study were monomicrobial, with S. aureus being the most prevalent microorganism, followed by enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa. The main resistant microorganism in diabetic foot infections requiring hospitalization was methicillin-resistant golden staphylococcus, which was found in 12% of the series.
TI  - Difficult intubation provokes bacteremia.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of bacteremia after mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, and endotracheal intubation before induction of general anesthesia and to discover any correlation between traumatic manipulations and bacteremia. The specific bacteria responsible, knowledge of which may guide the prophylactic use of antibiotics, also were investigated. METHODS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Three 10-mL blood samples were collected from a peripheral vein 10 min before induction of anesthesia, 10 min after mask ventilation, and 10 min after intubation. All samples were placed in aerobic and anaerobic bottles for culture and bacterial identification. RESULTS: Cultures received 10 min after intubation were positive in 12% of patients. The following strains were isolated: Escherichia coli in two cases, Staphylococcus aureus in three cases, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in one case. A strong positive correlation was found between difficult intubation and bacteremia. No correlation between bacteremia and easy intubation or between bacteremia and face mask ventilation was identified. CONCLUSION: Traumatic manipulations during difficult laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation could cause bacteremia. This finding may justify and guide prophylactic use of antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis: a clinician's reference to patient management.
AB  - Bisphosphonates (BPs), as inhibitors of osteoclasts, are widely used in the management of metastatic bone disease and in the prevention of osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Recent cases of bone necrosis of the jaws have been associated with the use of bisphosphonate therapy. A case is presented of a patient with osteonecrosis of the maxilla with a history of long-term bisphosphonate therapy for metastatic breast cancer. The authors treated the patient and suggest appropriate patient management guidelines with reference to current knowledge. Although a definitive treatment for bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis has not yet been established, clinicians must be aware of the pharmacologic properties of several bisphosphonates currently available and their indications, susceptible risk factors in the development of osteonecrosis of the jaws, the clinical signs and symptoms, and recommendations for patient management, including prevention and early recognition. BPs, potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, were first introduced more than 20 years ago. Since then, they have been used widely in the management of bone diseases, including hypercalcemia related to malignancy, myeloma-related bone disease, Paget's disease and osteoporosis. They have also been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and inhibit angiogenesis. These additional features have made BPs useful in the treatment of metastatic disease, including breast and prostate cancer, resulting in a rise in the medical use of these drugs. However, recent reports suggest that BPs, particularly the nitrogen-containing BPs pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa), both manufactured by Novartis of East Hanover, NJ, are capable of causing bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BON). With 2.5 million patients treated with pamidronate and/or zoledronate worldwide, BON occurs in about one per 10,000 treated patients (Novartis, unpublished data, 2004). Currently, the total number of reported cases associated with alendronate (Fosamax, Merck and Co. Inc., White-house Station, NJ) the most commonly prescribed oral bisphosphonate, is approximately 170 worldwide (C. Arsver, oral communication, March 2006). This corresponds to a spontaneous BON incidence of approximately 0.7 cases per 100,000-years exposure. However, there is insufficient data to determine why the osteonecrosis reported seems to particularly affect the jaw, with a slightly higher rate in the mandible than the maxilla. This report concerns the management of a patient with BON. Information provided includes: the pharmacologic properties of the several bisphosphonates currently available; the pathobiological mechanism; the clinical presentation of the oral lesions; and recommendations for the oral management of patients who have received BP therapy, with consideration of a preventative approach based on current knowledge.
TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - A retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private Greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. Through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. This study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in Greece. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "Lito" Private Obstetric/Gynecological Hospital, Athens, Greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During this period, 1632 women were examined. The mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. Three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. Of the isolates, in which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were Gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) Candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) Trichomonas vaginalis. Less usual isolates were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in Greece. Ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic Greek women included Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.
TI  - Microbiology and management of abdominal infections.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal infections. These infections include secondary peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, and cholangitis. The infection generally occurs because enteric microorganisms enter the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered. The predominant aerobic isolates are Escherichia coli, etc. The aerobic isolates are Escherichia coli, and enterococci, and the main anaerobic bacteria are Bacteroides fragilis group Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. The treatment of abdominal infection includes surgical correction and drainage of pus and administration of antimicrobials effective against both the aerobic and anaerobic pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of chorioamnionitis in 2nd-trimester C-section placentas and correlation with microorganism recovery from subamniotic tissues.
AB  - Prolonged exposure to infection appears to influence fetal/neonatal development.  We characterize the relationship between histologic patterns of inflammation and microorganism recovery from the placentas of live born infants delivered before the 28th postmenstrual week. The subamniotic parenchyma of 835 placentas delivered by cesarean section were cultured and evaluated for specific histologic patterns of inflammation in a blinded fashion. Cases with prolonged membrane rupture were excluded. Microorganisms were recovered from 41% of placentas. Microorganisms found more frequently in placentas with high-grade chorionic plate inflammation include Actinomyces, Prevotella bivia, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, multiple species of Streptococci, and Mycoplasma sp., including Ureaplasma urealyticum. These microorganisms were also associated with fetal vasculitis (neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic plate stem vessels or umbilical cord). Recovery of microorganisms from placental parenchyma is associated with histologic inflammation. The same microorganisms responsible for inciting high-grade chorionic plate inflammation are also most likely to promote fetal inflammation.
TI  - [A case of bacteremia by Atopobium rimae in a patient with liver cirrhosis].
AB  - Atopobium rimae, previously Lactobacillus rimae, is a strictly anaerobic, non-spore forming grampositive rod which was frequently isolated from odontogenic infection. We report a case of A. rimae bacteremia. A 47-yr-old man with liver cirrhosis was admitted to the hospital via emergency room due to fever and chill. His abdominal and pelvic computed tomography revealed a small abscess near the left adrenal gland. Three sets of blood cultures were taken and non-spore forming, grampositive rods were detected in all anaerobic vials. This isolate grew small nonhemolytic, gray-white translucent colonies on Brucella blood agar and was obligatory anaerobic on air-tolerance test. This organism was negative for catalase, indole, nitrate-reduction and beta-lactamase and failed to identify by Vitek ANI card (bioMerieux, France). 16S rRNA sequences of this showed 99.8% homology of the published sequence of A. rimae (GenBank accession number AF292371). Aspirates of periadrenal abscess grew Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus micros. He was treated with metronidazole and imipenem and follow-up cultures of blood were negative at days 4 and 10. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bacteremia of A. rimae.
TI  - [Co-occurence of indol-producing bacterial strains in the vagina of women infected with Chlamydia trachomatis].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine if cervicitis, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis), has an influence on the frequency of occurrence of selected aerobic and anaerobic bacterial strains, connected with etiology of aerobic vaginitis (AV) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Indole-producing bacteria have received particular attention due to their possibly inductive role in chronic cervicitis caused by C. trachomatis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The swabs from vagina and cervical canal have been obtained from 122 women (aged 18-40). The presence of C. trachomatis antigen had been detected and diagnosed with the help of direct immunofluorescence, BV with Amesl and Nugent criteria, whereas the AV with Donders criteria. The identification of the bacterial strains isolated from vagina has been performed according to classical microbiological diagnostics. RESULTS: Disruption of vaginal microflora (4-10 in Nugent score) was determined in 11,5% of observed women. AV was diagnosed in 4.5% women with chlamydial cervicitis, BV was diagnosed in 10.9% and 5.45% of these women, on the basis of Amsel and Nugent criteria respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Indole-producing bacterial strains connected with BV and AV (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli) have been isolated significantly more often from vagina of women infected with C trachomatis (p = 0.0405, chi2 = 4.20) and these findings confirm co-importance of indole-producing bacterial strains in cervicitis caused by C trachomatis .
TI  - Role of anaerobes in acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Pouch of Douglas aspirates were collected from 50 women with history and examination suggestive of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and 20 healthy women admitted for tubal ligation served as control. A total of 57 microorganisms were isolated from 37 patients out of 50 in study group. Of 37 positive cultures 21(56.7%) were monomicrobial and 16(43.2%) were polymicrobial. Most common symptom in study group was lower abdominal pain (90%), vaginal discharge (70%) and irregular bleeding (40%) and 30% patients had history of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) implantation. The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli, Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae while common anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus spp. Our study shows that cefotaxime, cefuroxime and gentamicin may be used for gram negative aerobic bacilli; cloxacillin, cephaloridine and erythromycin for aerobic gram positive cocci and amikacin and ceftazidime for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus for optimum therapy of acute PID it is beneficial to keep in mind major conceptual changes and therapeutic realities that have influenced current understanding of acute PID and have affected the choice of therapy.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2003 and march 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2005 to March 2006 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 384 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 161 (70.3%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and ninty-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 171 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary and postoperative infections. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. But cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum fl-lactamase was seen in 5.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that the increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and Bilophila wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - [Microbiocenosis of stomach in children with chronic gastritis].
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. Bacteriological study of gastric biopsies and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with Helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, S. pyogenes (group A), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, P. prevotii and their associations. In 20 studied patients with H.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. Study showed that eradication of H. pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. Not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of Candida albicans.
TI  - Evaluation of subgingival bacteria in the dog and susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in Italy for treatment of canine infections. Of the anaerobic bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by Peptostreptococcus + Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. Of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with Escherichia coli or Pasteurella multocida. Resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. Anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics tested. The emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated  from diabetic foot infections.
AB  - Against 443 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from diabetic foot infections, ceftobiprole MICs (microg/ml) at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1; methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, 0.5; Anaerococcus prevotii, 0.125; Finegoldia magna, 0.5; Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, 1; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 4; Escherichia coli and Enterobacter species, 0.125; Klebsiella species, 2; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 8.
TI  - Recombinant production of a VL single domain antibody in Escherichia coli and analysis of its interaction with peptostreptococcal protein L.
AB  - A kappa-light chain from a Fab expression system was truncated by the insertion of a stop codon in the gene sequence to produce a variable light (VL) single domain antibody (dAb). Here, we describe the expression of dAb in the periplasm of Escherichia coli through fermentation in a defined media. Immunoglobulin binding domains from peptostreptococcal protein L (PpL) have been shown to bind specifically to kappa-light chains. We have produced recombinant PpL, at high yield, and this was used to custom-produce PpL-Sepharose affinity columns. Here, we show that the affinity purification of VL dAb by this method is simple and efficient with no apparent loss in protein at any stage. The truncated dAb protein product was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE it was shown to be over 95% pure and produced at yields of 35-65 mg/L of culture medium. The dAb protein produced was shown by NMR and CD to be a folded beta-sheet domain. This domain is bound by PpL with a Kd of approximately 50 nM as determined by stopped-flow fluorimetry.

TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2004 to March 2005 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 645 strains including 17 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 226 (79.0%) of 286 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and seventeen strains were isolated from primary infections, and 345 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary infections followed by Bilophila wadsworthia. While the isolation rate of B. fragilis group was also the highest from postoperative infections, the following bacteria were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa but not multidrug-resistant was seen in 13.3 per cents. Also cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase was seen in 7.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that an increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and B. wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - Microbiological analysis and endoanal ultrasonography for diagnosis of anal fistula in acute anorectal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Treatment of anorectal sepsis requires prompt surgical drainage, but it is important to identify any associated anal fistula for preventing recurrence. We evaluated whether microbiological analysis and/or endoanal ultrasonography could be used to predict anal fistula in patients with acute anorectal sepsis. METHODS: Five hundred fourteen consecutive patients with acute anorectal sepsis were studied. Clinical data, digital examination findings, endosonographic findings, and results of microbiological analysis were compared with definitive surgical findings of the presence or absence of anal fistula. RESULTS: Anorectal abscess with anal fistula was found in 418 patients, and anorectal abscess without anal fistula was found in 96 patients. Microbiological examination showed that Escherichia coli, Bacteroides, Bacillus, and Klebsiella species were significantly more prevalent in patients with fistula (P<0.01), and coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Peptostreptococcus species were significantly more prevalent in patients without fistula (P<0.01). Results of endoanal ultrasonography were concordant with the definitive surgical diagnosis in 421 (94%) of 448 patients studied. CONCLUSION: Acute anorectal sepsis due to colonization of "gut-derived" microorganisms rather than "skin-derived" organisms is more likely to be associated with anal fistula. When the microbiological analysis yields gut-derived bacteria, but no fistula has been found in the initial drainage operation, repeat examinations during a period of quiescence, including careful digital assessment and meticulous endosonography, are warranted to identify a potentially missed anal fistula.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MIC90 of MEPM for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. MEPM were active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 2. As for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (IPM) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (87.9%). MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate both againt IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in Citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in Enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in Serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in Proteus mirabilis. The proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in P. aeruginosa. 4. Of all species tested, Peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which MIC90 of MEPM was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). Therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - [Soft tissue infections in oral, maxillofacial, and plastic surgery. Bacterial spectra and antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Soft tissue infections in the maxillofacial region are mainly caused  by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli but also by members of the genera Enterococcus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter, respectively. METHODS: In a prospective study 96 patients with severe maxillofacial non-odontogenic postoperative soft tissue infections were analyzed with regard to the bacterial spectrum and resistance patterns against antibiotics. The dominating bacteria were Streptococci (25% of the isolates) and Staphylococci (24% of the isolates). In addition, members of Enterobacteriaceae were isolated in approximately 10% of the cases. The most frequent anaerobes found were as follows: Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Prevotella and Fusobacterium. RESULTS: The resistance rates against antibiotics found were: penicillin G 36%, ampicillin 42%, and doxycycline 36%. In addition, the resistance rate against erythromycin and clindamycin was 26% and 7%, respectively. No resistant strains were detected against vancomycin and teicoplanin. All anaerobes showed a low antimicrobial resistance as previously described for odontogenic infections. CONCLUSION: In summary, soft tissue infections in the maxillofacial region present a different spectrum of bacteria in contrast to the well-investigated odontogenic infections. Antibiotic administration should be, whenever possible, performed after differentiation of involved strains and resistogram. The most promising antibiotics are imipenem, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin as well as cefotiam. Modern fluoroquinolones will be the antibiotics of the future.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human American tegumentary leishmaniasis in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
AB  - An evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. Microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. A total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type B (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type C (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). Proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), H(2)S-negative Proteus species (19.0%), Klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), Enterobacter species (9.5%), Peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), Pseudomonas species (4.8%), Prevotella bivia (4.8%), Escherichia coli (4.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), Bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), Candida albicans (9.5%) and Candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. Surprisingly, Staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). Concerning obligate anaerobes, all the Gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. The results of the present study show that microbial secondary contaminants, particularly Staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of ATL lesions.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (CMZ, Cefmetazon), MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including CMZ against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of CMZ in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Cefmetazon was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), Escherichia coli (3.6% --> 0.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), Proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), Morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), Providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), Bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). The Change in percent resistance of MRSA, other CNS, and B. flagiris tended to increase. It is necessary to pay much attention to trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. flagiris and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of selected chewing sticks.
AB  - This aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity in extracts obtained from various Nigerian chewing sticks. Aqueous extracts from seventeen chewing sticks and the fruit of C. ferruginea, one fruit used in oral hygiene in Nigeria, were screened for antibacterial activity against type cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eleven of the test extracts showed activity against at least two of these referenced organisms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these eleven extracts against clinical isolates from orofacial infection were determined. All the extracts demonstrated activity against Staphylococcal and Streptococcal isolates. Over half of the extracts were active against Enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobic isolates, including Prevotella melaninogenica, Porphyromonas gigivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii. Extracts of the Vitellaria paradoxa root, Bridellia ferruginea stem and twigs, Garcinia cola stem, Terminalia glaucescens root, Morinda lucida root, and Cnestis ferruginea fruit showed appreciable activity against all classes of bacterial isolates. The extracts of these plants may serve as sources for chemotherapeutic agents for the management of orofacial infections.
TI  - Trypanosoma cruzi: influence of predominant bacteria from indigenous digestive microbiota on experimental infection in mice.
AB  - To verify the influence of some predominant components from indigenous microbiota on systemic immunological responses during experimental Chagas disease, germ-free NIH Swiss mice were mono-associated with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides vulgatus or Peptostreptococcus sp. and then infected with the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. All the mono-associations predominantly induced a Th1 type of specific immune response to the infection by T. cruzi. A direct correlation was observed between a higher survival rate and increased IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production (P<0.05) in E. faecalis-, B. vulgatus-, and Peptostreptococcus-associated mice. Moreover, higher levels of anti-T. cruzi IgG1 and anti-T. cruzi IgG2a were also found in mono-associated animals after infection. On the other hand, with the exception of E. faecalis-associated mice, mono-association induced a lower IL-10 production after infection (P<0.05) when compared with germ-free animals. Interestingly, spleen cell cultures from non-infected germ-free and mono-associated mice spontaneously produced higher levels (P<0.05) of IL-10 than cultures from infected mono-associated mice, except again for E. faecalis-associated animals. In conclusion, the presence of the components of the indigenous microbiota skews the immune response towards production of inflammatory cytokines during experimental infection with T. cruzi in gnotobiotic mice. However, the degree of increase in production of cytokines depends on each bacterial component.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis in HIV-positive subjects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP) is a painful and potentially debilitating affliction that affects about 2% to 6% of HIV-positive subjects. NUP may be caused by specific microorganisms that are presently unknown or by microbial species not usually thought to cause periodontal infections. The purpose of this study was to define the bacterial species associated with NUP in HIV-positive patients. METHODS: 16S rRNA bacterial genes of DNA isolated from subgingival plaque of 8 HIV-positive subjects with NUP were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into Escherichia coli. The sequences of cloned inserts were used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences. The microbial profiles in subgingival plaque of subjects with NUP, chronic periodontitis, and periodontal health were compared using a battery of over 200 oligonucleotide probes in a PCR-based, reverse-capture, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay. RESULTS: Sequence analysis of over 400 clones revealed 108 species; 65 were "uncultivable" phylotypes, of which 26 were novel to NUP subjects. Species or phylotypes most commonly detected were Bulleidia extructa, Dialister, Fusobacterium, Selenomonas, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, and the phylum TM7. Based on sequence analysis and checkerboard analysis, NUP did not possess the classical periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis. Otherwise, the microbial profiles of NUP and periodontitis had many similarities. The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque from periodontally healthy subjects were different and less complex in comparison to the profiles of both disease groups. CONCLUSIONS: Certain species appear to be associated with health and periodontal diseases. The putative pathogens associated with periodontal disease in HIV-negative subjects are not associated with NUP in HIV-positive subjects.
TI  - Toll-like receptors-2, -3 and -4 expression patterns on human colon and their regulation by mucosal-associated bacteria.
AB  - The colonic epithelium provides an interface between the host and micro-organisms colonising the gastrointestinal tract. Molecular recognition of bacteria is facilitated through Toll-like receptors (TLR). The colonic epithelium expresses relatively high levels of mRNA for TLR3 and less for TLR2 and -4. Little is known of the expression patterns and mode of induction of expression for these pattern recognition receptors in human colon. The aim of this study was to investigate their localization in the gut and induction of expression in epithelial cell lines by mucosal bacteria. TLR2 and -4 were expressed only in crypt epithelial cells, expression was lost as the cells matured and moved towards the gut lumen. In contrast, TLR3 was only produced in mature epithelial cells. HT29 and CACO-2 had different levels of expression for TLR1-4. Co-culture of HT29 cells with different mucosal isolates showed that they were highly responsive to bacterial challenge, with up-regulation of mRNA for TLR1-4. In contrast, CACO-2 cells were refractive to bacterial challenge, showing little difference in mRNA levels. TLR3 was induced in HT29 only by Gram-positive commensals with up-regulation of both mRNA and protein and an enhancement of the antiviral immune response. This pattern of expression allows induction of responsiveness to bacteria only by the crypt epithelium so that tolerance to commensal organisms can be maintained. In contrast, mature columnar epithelium is able to respond to viral pathogens, which are not part of the normal gut commensal microbiota.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2003 to March 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. Two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenm-resistant P. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. Last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant E. coli in this year. In the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and Enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.
TI  - Properties of the thermostable glutamate dehydrogenase of the mesophilic anaerobe Peptostreptoccus asaccharolyticus purified by a novel method after over-expression in an Escherichia coli host.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus glutamate dehydrogenase (L-glutamate: NAD+ oxidoreductase (deaminating); EC 1.4.1.2) overexpressed in Escherichia coli has been purified by two new methods. Enzyme made by the first method showed remarkable thermophilicity, with a temperature optimum of 60 degrees C, and also thermostability, which suggested the second, simpler method, incorporating a heat step. This produced 94 mg of homogeneous protein per litre culture medium. The basic kinetic parameters for P. asaccharolyticus glutamate dehydrogenase with all substrates are revealed at pH 7.0. The enzyme is highly specific for NAD+, with values for kcat/Km 405 times greater than for NADP+. In the reverse direction of reaction, the kcat/Km value for NADH is almost 1000-fold greater than for NADPH.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous levofloxacin at 750 milligrams and various doses of metronidazole in healthy adult subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of intravenous levofloxacin at 750 mg administered once daily combined with three different dosages of intravenous metronidazole (500 mg every 8 h [q8h], 1,000 mg q24h, and 1,500 mg q24h). Eighteen healthy adult subjects received all three combinations in a randomized, crossover fashion. Serial blood and urine samples were collected on the third day of each study period. The 24-h areas under the inhibitory (AUIC(0-24)) and bactericidal (AUBC(0-24)) curves of these three combination regimens were determined against clinical isolates of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Escherichia coli. The mean concentrations of levofloxacin were not different between study periods and were similar to those previously published. The mean (+/- standard deviation) areas under the metronidazole plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-24)) for 1,500-mg q24h (338 +/- 105 mg.h/liter) and 500-mg q8h (356 +/- 68 mg.h/liter) regimens were not different (P > 0.05), but both were significantly higher than the 1,000-mg q24h AUC(0-24) (P < 0.05, 227 +/- 57 mg.h/liter). Mean (+/- standard deviation) total body clearance and renal clearance values were similar among the 500-mg q8h, 1,000-mg q24, and 1,500-mg q24h regimens (62 +/- 7, 67 +/- 13, and 67 +/- 14 and 11 +/- 3, 12 +/- 2, and 12 +/- 5 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively). Levofloxacin at 750 mg q24h plus metronidazole at 500 mg q8h or 1,500 mg q24h resulted in similar AUIC(0-24) and AUBC(0-24) values with one exception: the AUIC(0-24) for the 1,500-mg q24h regimen against B. thetaiotamicron was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of the other regimens. Overall, the combination of levofloxacin at 750 mg once daily and metronidazole at 500 mg q8h or 1,500 mg q24h appeared to have greater AUIC(0-24) and AUBC(0-24) values than did the 1,000-mg q24h regimen. All combination regimens of levofloxacin and metronidazole were well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse effects were reported. The pharmacokinetic, safety, and pharmacodynamic data from our study suggest that a once-daily regimen of intravenous levofloxacin at 750 mg and metronidazole at 1,500 mg warrants further clinical investigation.
TI  - Intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. They often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. The original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. The predominant aerobic isolates are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are Bacteroides fragilis group Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Clostridium spp. The treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology, and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2002 and March 2003].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2002 to March 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 334 strains were isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citobacter freundii. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci nor P. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. But we noticed cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral Cephems against various clinically isolated strains].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activities of oral Cephems against isolated from  the patients with the respiratory infections, the urinary tract infections, and infections in the obstetrics field of an adult and a child, during the period from 2002 to 2003; Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli of 40 strains of each, and Peptostreptococcus spp. 22 strains. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains that resistant is regarded were collected mainly, penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) strains. The MICs of Cephems except cefaclor (CCL) were < or = 0.03 microgram/mL against all strains of S. pyogenes. The MICs of cefteram (CFTM) and cefditoren (CDTR) were < or = 0.0125 microgram/mL activity against 7 strains penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP). However the MIC90s of cefditoren (CDTR) was 1 microgram/mL, cefteram (CFTM), and cefcapene (CFPN) were 2 micrograms/mL against PISP and PRSP, were higher than those of other drugs, but showed slightly higher than PSSP. The MIC90s of Cephems. were 0.5-4 micrograms/mL against strains of E. coli. The MIC90s of CFTM was 0.5 microgram/mL, and CDTR, CFPN were 1 microgram/mL against E. coli were higher than those of other drugs. The four strains of E. coli however were highly-resistant which MIC90s of CCL were more than 32 micrograms/mL were obtains. Furthermore it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant such as E. coli of Cephems. Although all strains showed resistant to AMPC, MIC90 of Cephems were 0.25-1 microgram/mL, good activities against K. pneumoniae. Against beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-susceptible H. influenzae (BLNAS) 23 strains the MIC90s of CCL and other Cephems were 64 micrograms/mL and 0.25-8 micrograms/mL. The MIC90s of CDTR and CFTM were < or = 1 microgram/mL of BLNAR (15 strains). However there of CFDN and CPDX were 8 micrograms/mL and CCL were > or = 16 micrograms/mL. Two strains which were produced beta-lactamase were highly--ABPC resistant. Although B. catarrhalis all strains were produced beta-lactamase and Cephems except for CCL showed better susceptibility than AMPC. The MIC90s of Cephems were 0.25-2 micrograms/mL against Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (CMZ) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan was evaluated yearly for two years from June 2000 to March 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and flomoxef (FMOX). In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002. In these surveillances spanning two years, the MIC90s of CMZ against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. Changes in percent resistance of each species to CMZ (MIC of CMZ > or = 32 micrograms/mL) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 73%-->87%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (other CNS, 13%-->18%), Escherichia coli (4%-->1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), Proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), Proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), Morganella morganii (7%-->0%), Providencia spp. (17%-->0%), Peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), Bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other Bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). The change in percent resistance of MRSA, S. epidermidis, other CNS, and other Bacteroides spp. tended to increase. In addition, the percent resistance of B. fragilis was 10%. It is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. Compared to other drugs tested, against MSSA, the activity of CMZ was inferior to that of CEZ, CTM, and FMOX and superior to that of SBT/CPZ. Against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and CNS, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. Against Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and inferior to that of FMOX. Against B. fragilis and other Bacteroides spp., the activity of CMZ was almost superior to that of CEZ and CTM, and comparable to or inferior to that of SBT/CPZ and FMOX. No remarkable changes in the activity of CMZ were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before CMZ was launched. This result suggests that CMZ still maintains potent activity.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2001 and March 2002].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2001 to March 2002 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, four hundred and twenty strains were isolated from 175 (79.2%) of 221 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and eighty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 234 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of Staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of Enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation rate of E. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp., E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. We noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Microbiology and management of intra-abdominal infections in children.
AB  - The present review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal infections in children. Infection generally occurs due to the entry of enteric micro-organisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from the peritoneal cavity of these patients. The predominant aerobic isolates are Escherichia coli, and enterococci; the main anaerobic bacteria are Bacteroides fragilis group, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. The treatment of abdominal infection includes surgical correction and drainage, and administration of antimicrobials that are effective against both aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2000 and March 2001].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibilities during the period from April 2000 to March 2001 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 234 for one year. A total of 388 strains (136 strains from primary infections and 252 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 165 cases (70.5% of total cases). In primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. There was no vancomycin-resistant S. aureus nor Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1999 and March 2000].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. In this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from April 1999 to March 2000) have been summarized. Two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). Of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, Streptococcus spp., and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among Gram-positive aerobes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii among Gram-positive anaerobes, E. coli among Gram-negative aerobes, and Bacteroides fragilis among Gram-negative anaerobes. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. The percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of Gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of Gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for 70.7% of S. aureus (41 strains). Either the number of strain or the percentage of MRSA decreased. The susceptibilities of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. S. aureus showed good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  - Sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. We noticed that Mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). The stimulation of rat mast cells with Staphylococccus cohnii, Staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides capillosus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). Other bacteria strains (Staphylococcus epidermidids, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Comparison of ligand polarization and enzyme activation in medium- and short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase-novel analog complexes.
AB  - Spectroelectrochemical and off-resonance Raman indicate that substrate/product binding to medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase (pMCAD) results in ligand polarization and positive flavin potential shifts, which activate the enzyme for electron transfer. Bacterial short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (bSCAD) typically exhibits smaller potential shifts upon substrate/product binding that have not been linked to ligand polarization. To further investigate the roles of ligand binding and polarization in activation, several novel aromatic carboxyloyl-CoAs were designed. These analogs allowed for the first direct comparison of pMCAD and bSCAD mechanisms. The results indicate that pMCAD activation can occur without perceptible analog polarization. bSCAD data provide the first spectral evidence of ligand polarization. The potential alterations exhibited by ligand-bound bSCAD are smaller than those of pMCAD, while their directionality and magnitude suggest differing enzyme-analog interactions. Such data provide the first indication of variations in the activation mechanism of these enzymes, which were thought to be comparable in both structure and function.
TI  - Development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - A membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. Hybridization signals were read by NBT/BCIP color development. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, R. bromii, R. callidus, R. albus, Bifidobacterium longum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Eubacterium biforme, E. aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus,Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. The result was also confirmed by using specific PCR methods for these bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 16 acutely infected and 7 chronically infected sphenoid sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 29 isolates were recovered from the 16 cases of acute sphenoid sinusitis (1.8 per specimen): 22 aerobic and facultative (1.4 per specimen), and 7 anaerobic (0.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 10 specimens (62%), anaerobes alone were isolated in 3 (19%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 3 (19%). The predominant aerobic and facultative species were Staphylococcus aureus (9 isolates), Streptococcus spp (9), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A total of 28 isolates were recovered from the 7 cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis (4.0 per specimen): 11 aerobic and facultative (1.6 per specimen) and 17 anaerobic (2.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in I instance (14%), anaerobes alone in 3 instances (43%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 3 instances (43%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 1 each). The predominant anaerobes included Peptostreptococcus spp (4 isolates), Prevotella spp (5), and Fusobacterium spp (4). These findings illustrate the unique microbiology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
TI  - Design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - An oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. Cyanine5 (CY5)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or bacterial DNA using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, Clostridium leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Eubacterium biforme, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
TI  - Bacterial meningoencephalomyelitis in dogs: a retrospective study of 23 cases (1990-1999).
AB  - The clinical records of 23 dogs (1990-1999) with histopathologically confirmed bacterial meningoencephalomyelitis were evaluated retrospectively. No breed, age, sex, or weight predisposition was found. All the dogs presented with clinical signs of a brain lesion, whereas 5 of 23 had neck pain. Pyrexia was detected in 11 of 23 dogs on admission. CBCs revealed neutrophilic leucocytosis in 7 of 21 dogs and thrombocytopenia in 3 of 21 dogs. The serum chemistry profiles were abnormal in 15 of 21 dogs. The results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were abnormal in 13 of 14 dogs and aerobic CSF culture was positive for bacteria in 1of 8 samples. At postmortem examination, the lesions were localized to the central nervous system. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, and Klebsiella spp were the most frequently isolated bacteria from cultures collected at postmortem examination. Twelve papers reporting 51 total clinical cases of canine bacterial meningoencephalomyelitis were reviewed. The clinical signs and results of the CBC, serum chemistry, blood culture, and CSF analysis were collated and compared with those of this study. The results of the CSF analysis in this study were similar to those in the literature. CSF cultures documented in the literature were positive for Staphylococcus, Pasteurella. Actinomyces, Nocardia spp, and various anaerobic species including Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, and Bacteroides spp.
TI  - Identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (TRFPs): a rapid, PCR-based method.
AB  - Identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. We have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 16S rRNA gene fragment using a pair of universal PCR primers. The forward PCR primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-FAM) fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the PCR products after digestion with restriction enzymes. The PCR products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an automated DNA sequencer. The data was analysed with GeneScan software 2.1. Eleven bacteria (Eubacterium biforme, E. limosum, Peptostreptococcus productus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, C. perfringens and Escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. This protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm Er:YAG laser radiation on root surfaces: an  in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm Er:YAG laser radiation on root surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used 125 extracted teeth which were divided into 2 groups (A, B) of 40 teeth and 3 groups of 15 teeth (C, D, E). A defined and similarly-sized area of the root surface was inoculated with an aliquot of 7 microl of a bacterial suspension of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 43719), Eikenella corrodens (ATCC 51724), or Peptostreptococcus micros (ATCC 33270). Subsequently, the samples from each group were further divided into subgroups which have been irradiated either with 55, 75, and 105 (group A, B) or 55 and 75 (group C, D, E) laser pulses. 1 subgroup of each group was left untreated as control. The source of laser radiation was an Er:YAG laser emitting pulsed infrared radiation at a wavelength of 2.94 microm. The number of bacteria was determined using the surface spread plate technique. The statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by the Scheffe-test. RESULTS: Depending on the number of laser pulses the bacterial load in the E. coli group was reduced by the Er:YAG laser radiation after exposure to 105 laser pulses to 5.5% of the initial count and that in the Staph. aureus group to 15.1%. The number of bacteria in case of A. actinomytemcomitans was reduced to 8.3%, in case of E. corrodens to 3.0% and in case of P. micros to 22.0% after application of 75 laser pulses. CONCLUSION: Besides the selective removal of plaque and calculus, the 2.94 microm Er:YAG laser radiation causes reduction in bacteria on root surfaces.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (BL) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). METHODS: The microbiology, BL production by the different isolates, and BL contents in the sputum were determined. RESULTS: Eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). Aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (11), Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (19), Prevotella sp. (11), and Fusobacterium sp.(6). Mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. The predominant aerobic BLPB were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobic BLPB were Prevotella sp. and Fusobacterium sp. Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which BLPB were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor BLPB. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid detection of BL activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with AECB.
TI  - Chi1 torsion angle dynamics in proteins from dipolar couplings.
AB  - Experiments are presented for the measurement of one-bond carbon-proton dipolar coupling values at CH and CH2 ositions in 13C-labeled, approximately 50% fractionally deuterated proteins. 13Cbeta-1Hbeta dipolar couplings have been measured for 38 of 49 possible residues in the 63-amino-acid B1 domain of peptostreptococcal protein L in two aligning media and interpreted in the context of side-chain chi1 torsion angle dynamics. The beta protons for 18 of the 25 beta-methylene-containing amino acids for which dipolar data are available can be unambiguously stereoassigned, and for those residues which are best fit to a single rotamer model the chi(1) angles obtained deviate from crystal structure values by only 5.2 degrees (rmsd). The results for 11 other residues are significantly better fit by a model that assumes jumps between the three canonical (chi1 approximately -60 degrees, 60 degrees, 180 degrees ) rotamers. Relative populations of the rotamers are determined to within +/-6% uncertainty on average and correlate with dihedral angles observed for the three molecules in the crystal asymmetric unit. Entropic penalties for quenching chi1 jumps are considered for six mobile residues thought to be involved in binding to human immunoglobulins. This study demonstrates that dipolar couplings may be used to characterize both the conformation of static residues and side-chain motion with high precision.
TI  - Bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. However, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. OBJECTIVE: To determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. RESULTS: Aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). Specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; P < 0.01). Bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). Other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were Peptostreptococcus micros (66%), Bilophila wadsworthia (63%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (44%), Eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (41%). Of the aerobes Escherichia coli (88%) and Streptococcus anginosus group (former Streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. CONCLUSIONS: The shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. The unusually high frequencies of B. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new injectable carbapenem, S-4661, against gynaecological pathogens.
AB  - Carbapenems are often used to treat infections in obstetrics and gynaecology because of their activity against anaerobes. S-4661, a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic, has favourable pharmacokinetic properties and is not hydrolysed by dehydropeptidase I. We investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of S-4661 against strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia, which are major pathogens in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of S-4661 for these strains were 0.25 and 1 mg/L, respectively. The in vivo efficacy of S-4661 was evaluated in a rat model of intrauterine infection, namely pyometra caused by E. coli and B. fragilis. The accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the S-4661-treated group was less marked and the number of bacteria significantly lower than those in the untreated group. These results suggest that S-4661 may be useful for treating polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology.
TI  - Post-caesarean septicaemia in Kandang Kerbau Hospital, Singapore, 1993-1995.
AB  - We reviewed all documented cases of septicaemia following caesarean deliveries in Kandang Kerbau Hospital between 1st January 1993 to 31st December 1995. There were 22 cases of septicaemia among 8201 caesarean births, and hence the incidence is 2.7:1000. There were 45,412 deliveries, and the overall caesarean section rate was 18.1%. Among the 22 documented cases of septicaemia which came under this study, the most common clinical conditions found were endomyometritis (7 cases), urinary tract infection (6 cases), and wound infection (3 cases). One of the three cases with wound infection also had pneumonia. There was one patient who had mild transient myocarditis. We could not determine with certainty any site of infection in five patients. The most common bloodstream bacterial isolates was Staphylococcus aureus (16), while the uncommon ones were Acinetobacter baumanii (2), Escherichia coli (1), Klebsiella sp. (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1), Streptococcus Group F (1), Peptostreptococcus species and Veillonella species (1). There was no mortality and prompt, vigorous treatment had led to uneventful recovery in all the cases.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology in intra-abdominal infections associated with  diverticulitis.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of intra-abdominal infections associated with diverticulitis was studied in 110 specimens from the peritoneal cavity after intestinal perforation and in 22 specimens from abdominal abscesses. Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated from 17 (15%) of the peritoneal specimens, aerobic bacteria only from 12 (11%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora from 81 (74%). A total of 339 bacterial isolates was detected in peritoneal cultures (3.1 per specimen), comprising 155 aerobes (1.4 per specimen) and 184 anaerobes (1.7 per specimen). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 4 (18%) abscesses, aerobes alone in one (5%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 17 (77%). A total of 72 bacterial isolates (3.3 per specimen) was detected in abdominal abscesses - 35 aerobes (1.6 per specimen) and 37 aerobes (1.7 per specimen). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria in abdominal infections were Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. The most frequently isolated anaerobes were Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group), Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium and Fusobacterium spp.
TI  - Translocation of indigenous microflora in an experimental model of sepsis.
AB  - Translocation of viable bacteria from gut to bloodstream and other sterile body sites during shock has been demonstrated in several experimental and clinical studies. The factors causing translocation and its incidence at different stages of shock are not known. The aim of the study was to evaluate the importance of several factors causing translocation of indigenous microflora in an experimental model of septic shock based on intraperitoneal Escherichia coli sepsis in rats. Counts of inoculated E. coli and translocated bacteria in different locations, gut morphology and haematological values were evaluated at different stages of sepsis. Sepsis developed in all animals and E. coli achieved the highest counts in blood 6 h after inoculation. Translocation was commonest at 6 and 12 h after inoculation. Frequently translocating bacteria were lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, bacteroides and peptostreptococci. In early sepsis, translocation was associated with high E. coli counts in blood, yet in late sepsis the opposite correlation was present. Low infiltration by neutrophils in the ileum and decreased mitotic activity in the colon were associated with a high translocation rate. In early sepsis, translocation was associated with low lymphocyte counts, but in late sepsis, with low neutrophil counts. Translocation of bacteria (including anaerobes) that colonise the gut in high counts takes place during sepsis. Putative influencing factors such as activity of the primary disease (bacterial counts in blood), gut morphology or haematological values seem to have different impacts on translocation, depending on the stage of the disease.
TI  - An experimental mouse model to study the pathogenicity of Prevotella bivia and investigations of possible virulence.
AB  - Induction of subcutaneous abscesses in mice was used to study the pathogenicity of Prevotella bivia both in mono-infection and in mixed cultures with Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Virulence factors such as coaggregation and aggregate formation of cells, haemagglutination activity and tolerance to serum bactericidal activity were investigated for their possible role in P bivia pathogenicity. Monocultures of P bivia, E coli and Peptostreptococcus spp did not induce subcutaneous abscess at concentrations as high as 10(9) colony forming units/millilitre (cfu/ml). Only E coli persisted at the infection site for up to 7 days post infection but with a marked decline in cell count (8.0 x 10(2) cfu/ml). The anaerobic organisms did not persist at the infection sites beyond the fifth day. In contrast, mixed cultures of P bivia and E coli or all three organisms potentiated for infective abscess two weeks after infection. Viable cells were recovered from abscesses in greater numbers as the infection progressed. Prevotella bivia was the predominant organism in chronic abscesses while E coli predominated in abscesses in the acute stage of the infection. Prevotella bivia lacked haemagglutination activity against human and sheep erythrocytes and showed marked susceptibility to 50 per cent human serum. These may limit its haematogenous spread. Its ability to form aggregates in molar salt solutions and coaggregate with facultative organisms may account for its persistence in pathological sites.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of wound infection following spinal fusion in  children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of wound infections following spinal fusion in children. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical and microbiological records. RESULTS: Aspirates of pus from 18 infection sites showed bacterial growth. Anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 3 (17%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 3 (17%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 12 (67%). Forty-two isolates were recovered: 18 anaerobes (1.0 isolates per specimen) and 24 aerobes (1.3 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides sp. (9 isolates, including 8 Bacteroides fragilis group) and 5 Peptostreptococcus sp. The predominant aerobes were Escherichia coli (6) and Proteus sp. (5). An increase in recovery of E. coli and B. fragilis was noted in children with bowel or bladder incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in wound infections following spinal fusion in children.
TI  - Expression of a heterologous glutamate dehydrogenase gene in Lactococcus lactis highly improves the conversion of amino acids to aroma compounds.
AB  - The first step of amino acid degradation in lactococci is a transamination, which requires an alpha-keto acid as the amino group acceptor. We have previously shown that the level of available alpha-keto acid in semihard cheese is the first limiting factor for conversion of amino acids to aroma compounds, since aroma formation is greatly enhanced by adding alpha-ketoglutarate to cheese curd. In this study we introduced a heterologous catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) gene into Lactococcus lactis so that this organism could produce alpha-ketoglutarate from glutamate, which is present at high levels in cheese. Then we evaluated the impact of GDH activity on amino acid conversion in in vitro tests and in a cheese model by using radiolabeled amino acids as tracers. The GDH-producing lactococcal strain degraded amino acids without added alpha-ketoglutarate to the same extent that the wild-type strain degraded amino acids with added alpha-ketoglutarate. Interestingly, the GDH-producing lactococcal strain produced a higher proportion of carboxylic acids, which are major aroma compounds. Our results demonstrated that a GDH-producing lactococcal strain could be used instead of adding alpha-ketoglutarate to improve aroma development in cheese.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - Biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase I. Biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. The MIC(90) of biapenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. The in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. The accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. These results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
TI  - Microbiology of subphrenic abscesses: a 14-year experience.
AB  - The objective of the review was to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of subphrenic abscesses in relation with predisposing conditions. A retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 52 patients treated between 1974 and 1988 was conducted. Forty-three (83%) patients developed the abscesses after an operative procedure. These included 11 patients after colonic, 9 patients after gastric or duodenal, 7 patients after abdominal trauma, 7 patients after biliary, and 6 patients after appendix surgery. A total of 194 organisms (3.7 isolates/specimen), 83 aerobic (1.6/specimen), and 111 anaerobes (2.1/specimen) were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 7 (13%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 34 (65%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 47 (90%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Escherichia coli (28 isolates), Enterococcus group D(9), and Staphylococcus aureus (9). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (33 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (25), Clostridium species (13), and Prevotella species (6). The number of isolates/site varied. The number of anaerobic bacteria/site outnumbered or was equal to the number of aerobic or facultatives in all instances, except in abscesses after biliary surgery. Their number/site was especially high in abscesses after appendectomy, and the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was the lowest after gastric or duodenal surgery. S. aureus predominated after gastric, duodenal and posttrauma surgery; B. fragilis predominated after colonic, appendix, and postabdominal trauma surgery; Enterococcus group D predominated after biliary surgery; Fusobacterium and Prevotella species predominated after gastric or duodenal surgery; and Clostridium species predominated after colonic or appendix surgery. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of subphrenic abscesses and their correlation with predisposing surgery.
TI  - Minimal debridement in the treatment of Fournier's gangrene.
AB  - Scrotal and perineal gangrene of the male genitalia was first described by Fournier in 1883. Treatment of the disease remains surgical despite the availability of modern antibiotics. Many authors advocate a wide debridement of all tissue superficial to the involved fascial layers. We have reviewed our experience of using wide and minimal debridement as the surgical technique of choice. In our retrospective study, nine patients were diagnosed and treated over a 2-year period for Fournier's gangrene. The mean age was 65+/-28 years. Two patients were admitted from chronic care facilities, four were diabetic, and two had taken oral steroids. Five of the nine patients were treated with the technique of minimal tissue debridement. In brief, the scrotum was bivalved along the median raphe, each scrotal sac was drained, and the testicles were exteriorized. Orchiectomy was performed if the testicles were grossly necrotic. Penrose drains were inserted from each scrotal sac to the counterincision at the level of the internal rings. All of the tissue involved was irrigated with betadine and peroxide, after debridement of the necrotic tissue. Broad-spectrum antibiotics along with daily packing were continued for 4 to 6 weeks; at the end of that time the testicles were returned to the scrotum and the skin was loosely reapproximated. Three of the nine patients were treated with wide debridement of all the soft tissue including the fascia. One of the patients displayed gangrene of the entire abdominal wall; he was not a surgical candidate and died 3 days later. The four patients treated with minimal debridement all obtained successful treatment of their fasciitis. However, one died of complications related to a duodenal ulcer. The mean hospital stay was 45+/-10 days. Two of the three patients treated with wide debridement required plastic reconstruction using a skin-muscle flap of the perineum. The remaining patient treated with wide debridement died of complications related to metastatic renal carcinoma. The mean hospital stay of this group was 62+/-12 days. The specific flora included: Bacteroidis fragilis in 87 per cent, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus in 75 per cent, Clostridia group, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas in 62 per cent, Klebsiella in 50 per cent, Staphylococcus in 37 per cent, and Proteus in 12 per cent of the patients. In the surgical management of Fournier's gangrene, wide drainage with minimal debridement resulted in similar morbidity and shorter hospital stay when compared with extensive debridement.
TI  - In vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (Amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  - It has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. Thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. The six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules A (amylose; Sigma) and B (Culture Pro 958N). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., and strains of Eubacterium, Clostridium, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. In fact, C. butyricum and Bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. Starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides cells and were extracellular for C. butyricum. Active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on SDS-PAGE gels showed that the Bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (M(r)) weights (>160,000), medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). It was concluded that Bifidobacterium spp. and C. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.
TI  - Microbiology of infected pustular psoriasis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections can occur in lesions of pustular psoriasis (PP). The objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected PP. METHODS: A retrospective 10-year review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected PP lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 patients (52%), anaerobic bacteria only in four (17%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in seven (30%). Thirty-six isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 23 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 13 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates), Group D Enterococcus (two isolates), and Escherichia coli (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (six isolates) and Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, and pigmented Prevotella spp. in two each. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (61%), 11 of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 18 patients (78%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. S. aureus was isolated from all body sites. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric Gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on the legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the hand. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected PP lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions were demonstrated.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal activities of new oral penem, faropenem against the various clinical isolates].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of faropenem (FRPM) more compared with those of various oral beta-lactams against 15 isolates each of 6 species of microorganism. FRPM possessed potent in vitro antibacterial activity against both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria tested. FRPM showed the same activity as new oral cephems such as cefdinir, cefditoren and cefcapene against all Gram-negative bacteria, but K. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible. The MBC of FRPM against S. pneumoniae and the other strains tested equal and were within 1 dilution the MIC of that, respectively. These results suggest that FRPM has excellent in vitro bactericidal activity against clinical isolates and is a clinically useful for the chemotherapy of bacterial infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - [Trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  - Presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (LGT) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. It is currently accepted that infections of the LGT are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. This means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. Lactobacillus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with Streptococcus (aerobe), Streptococcus agalactiae and others like Enterococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides sp., Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Fusobacterium, Escherichia coli. Different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). They are discussed in different sections. Trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to Chlamydia with excellent clinical results and a good tolerance. It was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. New fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. The use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.
TI  - Microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses in children.
AB  - Samples of pus from 41 children with retroperitoneal abscess treated between 1974 and 1994 yielded a total of 125 organisms (3.0 isolates/specimen); 58 isolates were aerobic and facultative species (1.4/specimen) and 67 were anaerobic (1.6/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 7 (17%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from 3 (7%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 31 (76%); 34 (83%) infections were polymicrobial. The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (19 isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (6), and the predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (22) and Prevotella spp. (5).
TI  - Differential induction of colitis and gastritis in HLA-B27 transgenic rats selectively colonized with Bacteroides vulgatus or Escherichia coli.
AB  - Resident bacteria play an important role in initiating and perpetuating gastrointestinal inflammation. We previously demonstrated that six commensal bacteria including Bacteroides vulgatus caused more aggressive colitis and gastritis in HLA-B27 transgenic rats than did the other five bacteria without B. vulgatus. This study compared the degree of gastrointestinal inflammation in gnotobiotic HLA-B27 transgenic rats monoassociated with either B. vulgatus or Escherichia coli. Gnotobiotic transgenic rats raised in Trexler isolators were selectively colonized with either B. vulgatus or E. coli. Control rats were either germfree or colonized with six common commensal bacteria (Streptococcus faecium, E. coli, Streptococcus avium, Eubacterium contortum, Peptostreptococcus productus, and B. vulgatus [DESEP-B]). After 1 month, all the rats were killed and tissues were prepared for histologic and biochemical evaluation. Colitis induced by B. vulgatus monoassociation was almost equal to that in DESEP-B-colonized rats and was significantly more severe than E. coli-induced colitis, which was absent by histological testing and mild by colonic myeloperoxidase and interleukin-1beta concentration determinations. However, gastritis was detectable only in DESEP-B-associated rats. These studies suggest that not all resident bacteria have equal proinflammatory capabilities, since B. vulgatus alone is more active than E. coli alone in inducing colitis, and that colitis and gastritis result from different luminal bacterial stimuli.
TI  - Prevalence of corynebacterial 16S rRNA sequences in patients with bacterial and "nonbacterial" prostatitis.
AB  - The etiology of chronic prostatitis syndromes in men is controversial, particularly when positive cultures for established uropathogens are lacking. Although identification of bacteria in prostatic fluid has relied on cultivation and microscopy, most microorganisms in the environment, including some human pathogens, are resistant to cultivation. We report here on an rRNA-based molecular phylogenetic approach to the identification of bacteria in prostate fluid from prostatitis patients. Positive bacterial signals were seen for 65% of patients with chronic prostatitis overall. Seven of 11 patients with bacterial signals but none of 6 patients without bacterial signals were cured with antibiotic-based therapy. Results indicate the occurrence in the prostate fluid of a wide spectrum of bacterial species representing several genera. Most rRNA genes were closely related to those of species belonging to the genera Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, and Escherichia. Unexpectedly, a wide diversity of Corynebacterium species was found in high proportion compared to the proportions of other bacterial species found. A subset of these 16S rRNA sequences represent those of undescribed species on the basis of their positions in phylogenetic trees. These uncharacterized organisms were not detected in control samples, suggesting that the organisms have a role in the disease or are the consequence of the disease. These studies show that microorganisms associated with prostatitis generally occur as complex microbial communities that differ between patients. The results also indicate that microbial communities distinct from those associated with prostatitis may occur at low levels in normal prostatic fluid.
TI  - Bacterial populations contaminating the upper gut in patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SIBOS) is characterized by an abnormally high bacterial population level in the upper gut, exceeding 10(5) organisms/ml (5 log colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml). To understand its origin and select an appropriate antibiotic treatment, we have analyzed the bacterial populations contaminating the upper gut in SIBOS patients. METHODS: Jejunal samples of 63 consecutive patients with diarrhea or malabsorption and conditions predisposing to SIBOS were cultured and antibiotic sensitivities determined. RESULTS: Concentrations of total, microaerophilic, and anaerobic bacteria were confirmed in 55 patients with SIBOS (mean +/- SE) 7.6 +/- 0.8, 7.4 +/- 0.9, and 6.1 +/- 0.7 log CFU/ml, respectively. Mean number of bacterial genera was 4.6 +/- 0.8. The main bacteria recovered were (mean +/- SE log CFU/ml) Streptococcus (71%; 6.4 +/- 0.8), Escherichia coli (69%; 7.2 +/- 0.9), Staphylococcus (25%; 6.2 +/- 0.6), Micrococcus (22%; 6.0 +/- 0.7), Klebsiella (20%; 7.1 +/- 0.8), Proteus (11%; 6.1 +/- 0.8) for microaerophilic bacteria, and Lactobacillus (75%; 6.1 +/- 1.1), Bacteroides (29%; 6.9 +/- 1.3), Clostridium (25%; 5.5 +/- 1.0), Veillonella (25%; 5.3 +/- 0.7), Fusobacterium (13%; 4.8 +/- 0.5), and Peptostreptococcus (13%; 6.1 +/- 0.7) for anaerobic bacteria. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefoxitin were efficient on >90% of strains. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminating flora isolated in SIBOS include commonly identified oropharyngeal and colonic flora, but these occur in SIBOS at different levels from those usually found in their original location. These data may hopefully serve as a starting point to further therapeutic controlled studies.
TI  - In vitro activities of pazufloxacin, a novel injectable quinolone, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - T-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Pazufloxacin (T-3761) is an active form of T-3762. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for Prevotella bivia. The MICs of T-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for S. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for G. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for E. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for P. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for B. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for P. bivia. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, T-3762, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. The study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. Thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. Smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (PD >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared to non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. The samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann-Whitney U-test) showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while Streptococcus intermedius, A. naeslundii, A. israelii and Eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as E. coli, C. albicans, A. fumigatus and S. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of surgical-site infection following spinal fusion.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of surgical-site infections (SSI) following spinal fusion was retrospectively studied. This was done by reviewing the clinical and microbiological records at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Md., from 1980 to 1992. Aspirates of pus from 25 infection sites showed bacterial growth. Aerobic bacteria only were recovered from 9 (36%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered from 4 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 12 (48%). Sixty isolates were recovered: 38 aerobes (1.5 isolates per specimen) and 22 anaerobes (0.9 isolate per specimen). The predominant aerobes were Escherichia coli (n = 8) and Proteus sp. (n = 7). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 9) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (n = 6) isolates. An increase in recovery of E. coli and B. fragilis was noted in patients with bowel or bladder incontinence. This study highlights the polymicrobial nature of SSI and the importance of anaerobic bacteria in SSI following spinal fusion.
TI  - Purification and properties of NADH-dependent 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MetF) from Escherichia coli.
AB  - A K-12 strain of Escherichia coli that overproduces methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MetF) has been constructed, and the enzyme has been purified to apparent homogeneity. A plasmid specifying MetF with six histidine residues added to the C terminus has been used to purify histidine-tagged MetF to homogeneity in a single step by affinity chromatography on nickel-agarose, yielding a preparation with specific activity comparable to that of the unmodified enzyme. The native protein comprises four identical 33-kDa subunits, each of which contains a molecule of noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). No additional cofactors or metals have been detected. The purified enzyme catalyzes the reduction of methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate, using NADH as the reductant. Kinetic parameters have been determined at 15 degreesC and pH 7.2 in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer; the Km for NADH is 13 microM, the Km for CH2-H4folate is 0.8 microM, and the turnover number under Vmax conditions estimated for the reaction is 1,800 mol of NADH oxidized min-1 (mol of enzyme-bound FAD)-1. NADPH also serves as a reductant, but exhibits a much higher Km. MetF also catalyzes the oxidation of methyltetrahydrofolate to methylenetetrahydrofolate in the presence of menadione, which serves as an electron acceptor. The properties of MetF from E. coli differ from those of the ferredoxin-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase isolated from the homoacetogen Clostridium formicoaceticum and more closely resemble those of the NADH-dependent enzyme from Peptostreptococcus productus and the NADPH-dependent enzymes from eukaryotes.
TI  - Microbiology of perianal cellulitis in children: comparison of skin swabs and needle aspiration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of perianal cellulitis in children, comparing skin swab and needle aspirate methodology. METHOD: Swabs of involved skin and needle aspirates of cellulitis were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Specimens obtained from 10 patients with perianal cellulitis showed bacterial growth. Polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora was found in all skin surface cultures, where the predominate isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and alpha hemolytic streptococci. The number of isolates in needle aspirates varied between one and two. The predominant ones were E. coli (3), Peptostreptococcus spp. (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Bacteroides fragilis group (2). Complete or partial concordance in microbiology between skin swabs and needle aspirates was present in six instances. In four instances, isolates recovered from needle aspirates were not isolated from the skin surface. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the diversity of aerobic and anaerobic organisms isolated from perianal cellulitis, and the superiority of needle aspirates in establishing the microbiology of the infection.
TI  - Microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses.
AB  - To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses and correlate the results with predisposing factors, potential causes and routes of infection, clinical and laboratory data of 48 patients with liver abscesses and 29 with spleen abscesses treated between 1970 and 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. In liver abscesses, a total of 116 isolates (2.4 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 43 were aerobic and facultative species (0.9 isolates/specimen) and 73 were anaerobic species or microaerophilic streptococci (1.5 isolates/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 12 (25%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from eight (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 28 (58%); polymicrobial infection was present in 38 (79%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (11 isolates), Streptococcus group D (8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (13), Fusobacterium spp. (10), Clostridium spp. (10) and Prevotella spp. (4). There were 12 isolates of micro-aerophilic streptococci. S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were associated with trauma; Streptococcus group D, K. pneumoniae and Clostridium spp. with biliary disease; and Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with colonic disease. In splenic abscesses, a total of 56 isolates (1.9 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 23 were aerobic and facultative species (0.8 isolates/specimen), 31 were anaerobic species or micro-aerophilic streptococci (1.1 isolates/specimen) and two were Candida albicans. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from nine (31%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria from eight (28%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10 (34%) and C. albicans in two (7%); polymicrobial infection was present in 16 (55%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were E. coli (5 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (3), Streptococcus group D (3), K. pneumoniae (3) and S. aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (11 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Clostridium spp. (3). S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus group D were associated with endocarditis, E. coli with urinary tract and abdominal infection, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with abdominal infection and Fusobacterium spp. with respiratory infection.
TI  - Limited internal friction in the rate-limiting step of a two-state protein folding reaction.
AB  - Small, single-domain proteins typically fold via a compact transition-state ensemble in a process well fitted by a simple, two-state model. To characterize the rate-limiting conformational changes that underlie two-state folding, we have investigated experimentally the effects of changing solvent viscosity on the refolding of the IgG binding domain of protein L. In conjunction with numerical simulations, our results indicate that the rate-limiting conformational changes of the folding of this domain are strongly coupled to solvent viscosity and lack any significant "internal friction" arising from intrachain collisions. When compared with the previously determined solvent viscosity dependencies of other, more restricted conformational changes, our results suggest that the rate-limiting folding transition involves conformational fluctuations that displace considerable amounts of solvent. Reconciling evidence that the folding transition state ensemble is comprised of highly collapsed species with these and similar, previously reported results should provide a significant constraint for theoretical models of the folding process.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. A total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. The traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). A total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp (113), Clostridium spp (78), Prevotella spp (58), and Fusobacterium spp (23). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (83), Staphylococcus aureus (61), Streptococcus pyogenes (27), Streptococcus group D (16), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16). The types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). S. aureus was isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). This study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic characterization of ruminal tannin-tolerant bacteria.
AB  - The 16S rRNA sequences and selected phenotypic characteristics were determined for six recently isolated bacteria that can tolerate high levels of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Bacteria were isolated from the ruminal contents of animals in different geographic locations, including Sardinian sheep (Ovis aries), Honduran and Colombian goats (Capra hircus), white-tail deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from upstate New York, and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) from Oregon. Nearly complete sequences of the small-subunit rRNA genes, which were obtained by PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing, were used for phylogenetic characterization. Comparisons of the 16S rRNA of the six isolates showed that four of the isolates were members of the genus Streptococcus and were most closely related to ruminal strains of Streptococcus bovis and the recently described organism Streptococcus gallolyticus. One of the other isolates, a gram-positive rod, clustered with the clostridia in the low-G+C-content group of gram-positive bacteria. The sixth isolate, a gram-negative rod, was a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae in the gamma subdivision of the class Proteobacteria. None of the 16S rRNA sequences of the tannin-tolerant bacteria examined was identical to the sequence of any previously described microorganism or to the sequence of any of the other organisms examined in this study. Three phylogenetically distinct groups of ruminal bacteria were isolated from four species of ruminants in Europe, North America, and South America. The presence of tannin-tolerant bacteria is not restricted by climate, geography, or host animal, although attempts to isolate tannin-tolerant bacteria from cows on low-tannin diets failed.
TI  - Increased antibody production against gut-colonizing Escherichia coli in the presence of the anaerobic bacterium Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - Germ-free rats were colonized with E. coli alone, or with E. coli plus Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of the obligate anaerobic gram-positive species, Peptostreptococcus. The presence of Peptostreptococcus reduced translocation of E. coli, but increased the serum antibody response to E. coli antigen. Whereas the immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-E. coli antibodies largely represented cross-reactive antibodies, those of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype represented true anti-E. coli antibodies because they could not be absorbed by L. acidophilus or Peptostreptococcus but could with E. coli. We suggest that peptostreptococci prime the gut immune system to other bacterial antigens and that this could be a mechanism behind the reduced translocation of facultative anaerobes in the presence of obligate anaerobes.
TI  - In vitro activities of E1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - E1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. E1101 was the most active agent against S. agalactiae and E. coli. Since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, E1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  - A small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (GF) and conventional (CV) mice. The selected microorganisms were: Porphyromonas endodontalis (ATCC 35406), Eubacterium lentum (ATCC 25559), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC 27337), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 4083). Only P. anaerobius, E. coli, and E. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both CV and GF mice. E. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in CV animals. P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum were unable to colonize in CV and GF animals after single inoculation. It is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155 in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new 8-methoxyquinolonecarboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. The antibacterial activity of AM-1155 was almost equal to that of sparfloxacin. The in vivo efficacy of AM-1155 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra (E. coli and B. fragilis) model of rats. The accumulation of neutrophils to the uterus in the AM-1155-treated group was less marked than that of the nontreated group, as well as the bacteriological response. These results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent AM-1155 might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of chronic venous ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLU) is unclear. The objective of the study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of CVLU. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of the clinical and microbiological laboratory records obtained from patients with CVLU. Microorganisms were grown from 43 specimens obtained from 41 patients. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 18 (42%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only in three (7%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 22 (51%). In total, there were 97 isolates, 64 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.5 aerobes and 0.8 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (26 isolates), group D streptococci (5), and Escherichia coli(5). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (15), Bacteroides fragilis group (6), Propionibacterium acnes (4), and Prevotella spp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: CVLU have a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora.
TI  - Osteomyelitis of the fibula due to septic embolism: a rare complication of a graft enteric erosion. Case report.
AB  - We report the case of a 70-year-old female who experienced a graft enteric erosion (GEE) three years after a right aorto-femoral bypass. She was treated by right axillo-femoral bypass, removal of the aortic prosthesis and direct aortic suture. The duodenum was stitched up and separated from the aorta by omentoplasty. Bacteriological culture of the removed graft identified Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus. Antibiotic therapy consisting of Amoxicillin and Gentamycin was given for seven days. A month later this patient developed a fibula osteomyelitis due to the same germs. She was then treated by surgical excision of the infected tissues and by antibiotics: Amoxicillin, Metronidazole and Gentamycin for one month. This case of embolism into bone due to GEE is a rare complication which indisputably establishes a link between the spontaneously septic cavity of the bowel and bone tissue by way of blood via the interstices of the fabric. The prosthesis may be responsible for blood seeding infection and not only a mere victim. The prosthesis acts as a porous membrane which allows two opposite flows: the passage of blood from graft to bowel and germ migration from naturally septic bowel to blood. When a GEE is encountered, a rigorous management is required to prevent septic embolism. The precise timing of each step of the surgical procedure remains difficult to codify.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of various types of retroperitoneal abscesses was studied by review of the clinical and laboratory data for 161 patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for such abscesses. These included 109 anterior, 8 posterior, 21 retrofascial, and 23 pelvic retroperitoneal abscesses. A total of 472 organisms (2.9 isolates/specimen)--204 aerobic and facultative (1.3/specimen), and 268 anaerobic (1.7/specimen)--were recovered. Aerobes only were recovered from 34 abscesses (21%), anaerobes only from 34 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 93 (58%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 132 patients (82%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (60 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20), Streptococcus group D (19), and Staphylococcus aureus (11). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (95 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (66), Prevotella species (22), and Clostridium species (22). The number of anaerobes per site always was greater than the number of aerobic or facultative organisms and was especially high in pelvic abscesses. The number of aerobic and facultative organisms was especially high in pancreatic abscesses. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of retroperitoneal abscesses.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic infection associated with malignancy.
AB  - The goal of this work was to study the microbiology and clinical characteristics  of patients with infections associated with malignancy treated over a period of 17 years. A total of 668 specimens were obtained from 605 patients. The malignancies include 224 hematological malignancies and 381 nonhematogenic malignancies. Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 201 (30%) specimens, aerobic bacteria in 226 (34%), mixed aerobic-anaerobic bacteria in 231 (35%) and Candida spp. in 10 (1%). A total of 683 anaerobic (1.0 isolates per specimens) and 592 aerobic or facultative (0.9 per specimen) organisms were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group isolates (181), Peptostreptococcus spp. (166), Prevotella spp. (106), Clostridium spp. (70), and Fusobacterium spp. (43). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (133), Staphylococcus aureus (100), Klebsiella pneumoniae (48), and Pseudomonas aeroginosa (45). The type of infections included abscesses (221), bacteremia (198), wounds (175), including 61 cellulitis, 24 post-surgical wounds and 23 decubitus ulcers), peritonitis (48), empyema (12), cholecystitis (6) and thrombophlebitis (5). S. aureus and Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora (Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp.) predominated in local infections and bacteremia that originated from this site (head and neck wounds and abscesses and pulmonary infections), and organisms of the gastrointestinal tract flora predominated in infections that originated from this site (peritonitis, abdominal abscesses and decubitus ulcers). This retrospective study demonstrates polymicrobial features of many infections associated with malignancies.
TI  - Microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis associated with omphalitis in the newborn infant.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis in newborn infants. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review was done of the author's 20-year experience. RESULTS: Specimens obtained from 11 newborn infants with periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 38 bacterial isolates was recovered: 21 aerobic and facultative and 17 anaerobic. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 1 specimen (9%), anaerobes only in 2 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 8 (73%). Multiple organisms were recovered from all instances and the number of isolates varied from two to six (average 3.5 isolates per specimen). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp. (7 isolates); Bacteroides fragilis group (6); streptococcus group B (4); and Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group D, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis (3 each). All patients underwent extensive debridement and resection, and they received supportive and antimicrobial therapy. Six (55%) of the patients died. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new carbapenem BO-2727 for use in obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of BO-2727 against 100 clinical isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae (20 strains), Escherichia coli (20 strains), Peptostreptococcus magnus (20 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (20 strains) and Prevotella bivia (20 strains) was compared with those of imipenem, panipenem, meropenem, biapenem and ceftazidime (CAZ). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 50% of tested strains (MIC50s) of BO-2727 against S. agalactiae, E. coli, P. magnus, B. fragilis and P. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively. MIC90s of BO-2727 against S. agalactiae, E. coli, P. magnus, B. fragilis and P. bivia were 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.78 and 0.78 mg/l, respectively. The efficacy of BO-2727 was evaluated using a polymicrobial pyometra model (E. coli and B. fragilis) in rats. Both the inflammatory changes in the uterus, from the point of view of neutrophil accumulation, and the bacteriological response in the treated group were milder than those in either the nontreated group or the CAZ-treated group. These results indicate that BO-2727 may be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in patients with pyometra.
TI  - Microbiology of nosocomial sinusitis in mechanically ventilated children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the bacteriology of nosocomial sinusitis in mechanically ventilated children. METHOD: Retrospective review of sinus aspirate specimens obtained from 20 children with nosocomial sinusitis. The specimens were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 58 isolates (2.9 per specimen), 30 aerobic or facultative (1.5 per specimen) and 28 anaerobic (1.4 per specimen), were recovered. Aerobes only were present in 8 patients (40%), anaerobes only in 5 (25%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 7 (35%). The predominant aerobes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (5 isolates), Escherichia coli (3 isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (8 isolates), Prevotella species (6 isolates), and Fusobacterium species (4 isolates). Forty-one beta-lactamase bacteria were recovered from 14 specimens (70%). Thirty isolates similar to the sinus isolates were also recovered from the trachea, 6 from blood culture specimens, and 6 from other sites. Anaerobes were more commonly isolated from sinus aspirate samples obtained after 18 days of mechanical ventilation (21 vs 7, P<.05 by chi2). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of nosocomial sinusitis in mechanically ventilated children.
TI  - [Trend of bacterial meningitis in children over a 14 year period (1981 through 1994) in Japan--an analysis based on studies in 27 institutions].
AB  - We observed 266 children with purulent meningitis in 27 institutions in Japan during the 14 years from 1981 on dividing these years into 3 periods, 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1994, and studied the trend of causative organisms identified in 254 among the 266 patients. Their ages were less than 3 months after birth in 50 children and 3 months or older in 216: there were 141 boys and 125 girls. The causative organisms were H. influenzae in 134 patients and S. pneumoniae in 50, most of them being aged 3 months or older. Next to the above bacteria ranked S. agalactiae in 29 and E. coli in 12, many of the patients were aged less than 3 months. Staphylococcus spp. was found in 7 patients and about 70% of them were aged 3 months or older. L. monocytogenes was found in 4 patients and N. meningitidis in 3 and they were aged 3 months or older in both patient groups. S. pyogenes, Enterococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., P. Mirabilis and Enterobacter spp. were detected each in 1 patient. The causative organism was unknown in 21 patients and there was no double infection. H. influenzae were detected in 18 patients in 1981-1985 period (36.7%), in 56 in 1986-1990 (54.9%) and in 60 in 1991-1994 (63.8%) showing an increasing tendency, but S. pneumoniae exhibited neither an increasing nor decreasing tendency. There was a decreasing tendency with S. agalactiae and E. coli, but the details were not clear because there were few patients aged less than 3 months. Although the period of coexistence of 4 main bacterial species was not made clear in this study. Listeria is considered to develop mainly in the early childhood, and we believe that the conventional way of using a cephem preparation and ampicillin combined for patients under 6 years need not be altered. However, panipenem (phonetic) is likely to be effective for insensible S. pneumoniae for the time being.
TI  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscesses.
AB  - The microbiology of perirectal abscesses in 144 patients was studied. Aerobic or  facultative bacteria only were isolated in 13 (9%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 27 (19%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were isolated in 104 (72%) instances. A total of 325 anaerobic and 131 aerobic or facultative isolates were recovered (2.2 anaerobic isolates and 0.9 aerobic isolates per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis group (85 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp. (72 isolates), Prevotella spp. (71 isolates), Fusobacterium spp. (21 isolates), Porphyromonas spp. (20 isolates), and Clostridium spp. (15 isolates). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (34 isolates), Streptococcus spp. (28 isolates), and Escherichia coli (19 isolates). These data illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of perirectal abscesses.
TI  - Ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  - DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. Eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. Purified DNA was digested with BglI,EcoRI, and HindIII. Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S + 23S rRNA. Ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. The results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (S(AB)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the Dendron computer-assisted system. These results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the two genes coding for L-serine dehydratase from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus: relationship of the iron-sulfur protein to both L-serine dehydratases from Escherichia coli.
AB  - The structural genes sdhA and sdhB, coding for the alpha- and beta-subunits of the [4Fe-4S] cluster containing L-serine dehydratase from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, have been cloned and sequenced. Expression of modified sdhB together with sdhA in Escherichia coli led to overproduction of active His6-tagged L-serine dehydratase. E. coli MEW22, deficient in the L-serine dehydratase L-SD1, was complemented by this sdhBA construct. The derived amino acid sequence of SdhBA shares similarities with both monomeric L-serine dehydratases, L-SD1 and L-SD2, from E. coli and with a putative L-serine dehydratase from Haemophilus influenzae, which suggests that these three enzymes are also iron-sulfur proteins.
TI  - Organisms isolated from dogs and cats with anaerobic infections and susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of obligate anaerobic bacteria in bacterial infections in dogs and cats and susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents. DESIGN: Case series. SAMPLE POPULATION: Specimens from 1,267 dogs and 243 cats. PROCEDURE: Standard anaerobic and aerobic bacterial culture methods were used. Anaerobic isolates were tested for susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Obligate anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 199 (15.7%) and 69 (28.4%) specimens obtained from dogs and cats, respectively. More than half of the specimens that contained obligate anaerobic bacteria were from draining tracts (exclusively dogs), pleural fluid, abscesses, bones, the respiratory tract, or the abdominal cavity. The most commonly isolated obligate anaerobic bacteria (approx 70% of all isolates) were Bacteroides spp, Peptostreptococcus spp, Fusobacterium spp, and Porphyromonas spp. Eighty percent of the specimens that contained obligate anaerobic bacteria also contained facultative anaerobic or aerobic organisms. The organisms most commonly isolated in association with obligate anaerobic bacteria were members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli was the most common), Pasteurella spp, and Staphylococcus intermedius. Ninety-seven obligate anaerobic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and metronidazole. All were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and chloramphenicol, and most were susceptible to metronidazole. Only 71% of the Bacteroides isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, and only 83% were susceptible to clindamycin. Only 80% of the Clostridium isolates were susceptible to clindamycin, but all were susceptible to ampicillin. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Data on sites and conditions from which anaerobic bacteria are commonly isolated, along with results of susceptibility testing, may be useful in designing antimicrobial treatment regimens.
TI  - Microbiology of nonbullous impetigo.
AB  - Our objective was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of nonbullous impetigo (NI) in children. We used a retrospective review of clinical microbiology laboratory and patients' records. Specimens were obtained from 40 patients with NI lesions and showed bacterial growth. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 24 patients (60%), strict anaerobic bacteria only in 5 patients (12.5%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 11 patients (27.5%). Sixty-four isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen): 43 aerobic or facultative, and 21 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (29 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) (13 isolates), and Escherichia coli (1 isolate). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (12), pigmented Prevotella spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 17 patients (42.5%), 13 of which were S. aureus. S. aureus alone or mixed with GABHS or Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from all body sites. Mixed flora of Peptostreptococcus spp. with Prevotella spp. or Fusobacterium spp. was mostly found in infections of the head and neck, while E. coli mixed with B. fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from one infection of the buttocks area. Thirty-three organisms isolated from 32 patients (80%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic microbiology of NI lesions.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potent risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to detect the microbial profile of early onset periodontitis in smokers and compare it to that of non-smokers. The study population consisted of 50 systemically healthy individuals aged 25 to 38 years, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. 25 patients were smokers (> 20 cigarettes/day) and 25 non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples comprised of four periodontal sites with probing depth > 5 mm each, were collected from each individual. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The differences in bacterial counts using the Mann Whitney U test were statistically significant for Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, Bacteroides gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena and Candida albicans in smokers. Statistically significant differences for Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinomyces naeslundii, Eubacterium lentum and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora like E. coli, C. albicans and S. aureus in smokers microflora underscores the importance of the host which is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - Synthesis by an alpha-glucosidase of glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue.
AB  - Glycosyl-trehaloses with an isomaltosyl residue were synthesized by alpha-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger by using maltotetraose as a glucosyl donor and trehalose as the acceptor. The one trisaccharide and two tetrasaccharides formed were isolated by successive column chromatography. The results of an enzymatic digestion, methylation analysis, and 13C-NMR studies indicated that these oligosaccharides were alpha-isomaltosyl alpha-glucoside, alpha-isomaltotriosyl alpha-glucoside and alpha-isomaltoside. These oligosaccharides were not fermented to an acid by Streptococcus mutans, and they effectively inhibited water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by glucosyltransferase. In an in vitro utilization test with human intestinal bacteria, these oligosaccharides were predominantly utilized by Bifidobacteria.
TI  - Tissue penetration of Meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. Patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. Plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. The median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/mL. The median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. These tissue concentrations exceed the MICs of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. Meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. A single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by susceptible pathogens.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1995 and June 1996].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and sixty-four strains were isolated from primary infections, and 202 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from post operative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-negative, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Enterobacter spp. and Klebsiella spp. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We noticed that MICs of cefazolin against three out of 23 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml. Among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with MICs higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp.
TI  - Microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD). The objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected AD. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained from patients with secondarily infected AD lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). Seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three Candida sp. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and Escherichia coli in four. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in eight, and Fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were S. aureus. Twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected AD lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis in children.
AB  - Specimens obtained from eight children with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 21 isolates were recovered, 13 anaerobic and 8 aerobic or facultatives. The facultative organism Streptococcus pyogenes was present alone in two (25%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated in six (75%). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp. (6 isolates, including 3 Peptostreptococcus magnus). S. pyogenes (4), Bacteroides fragilis group (3), Clostridium perfringens (2), Escherichia coli (2), and Prevotella spp. (2). Organisms similar to the ones isolated from the NF aspirates were recovered in the blood of all patients except one. These included S. pyogenes (3 isolates). B. fragilis group (2), E. coli (1), and P. magnus (1) and Clostridium perfringens (1). All patients underwent surgical fasciotomy, and four required skin grafting. Antimicrobials were administered to all children. Despite extensive resection and intense supportive therapy, three patients died from sepsis accompanied by shock acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of NF in children.
TI  - Isolation of non-sporing anaerobic rods from infections in children.
AB  - From 1974 to 1994, 2033 microbiological specimens from children were submitted for cultures for anaerobic bacteria. Fifty-seven isolates of Bifidobacterium spp. were obtained from 55 (3%) children, 67 isolates of Eubacterium spp. from 65 (3%) children and 41 isolates of Lactobacillus spp. from 40 (2%) children. Most Bifidobacterium isolates were from chronic otitis media, abscesses, peritonitis, aspiration pneumonia and paronychia. Most Eubacterium isolates were from abscesses, peritonitis, decubitus ulcers and bites. Lactobacillus spp. were mainly isolated from abscesses, aspiration pneumonia, bacteraemia and conjunctivitis. Most (> 90%) infections from which these species were isolated were polymicrobial and yielded a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The organisms most commonly isolated with the non-sporing anaerobic gram-positive rods were Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Most Bacteroides spp. and E. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infection and skin and soft tissue infection around the rectal area, whereas most Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck sites. The predisposing conditions associated with the isolation of non-sporing anaerobic gram-positive rods were previous surgery, malignancy, steroid therapy and immunodeficiency. Antimicrobial therapy was given to 149 (83%) of the 160 patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 89 (56%).
TI  - [In vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, marbofloxacin (RO 09-1168) against strictly anaerobic bacteria and some bacteria from human fecal flora].
AB  - As recommended by the EEC, the in vitro activity of a veterinary quinolone has to be evaluated on human strains isolated from the gut and especially against anaerobes. Thus, the MICs for Marbofloxacin were determined by the reference agar method (Norma NCCLS M11 A3) using Wilkins Chalgren medium for the 124 anaerobic strains and Mueller Hinton agar for E. coli, Proteus, Enterococcus and Lactobacillus. On the whole aerobes, the activity of Marbofloxacin was equal or slightly greater to that of ofloxacin. The modal MIC was 0.03 mg/l for Enterobacteriaceae, 2 mg/l and 16 mg/l for Enterococcus and Lactobacillus strains, respectively. Considering the anti-anaerobic activity of this new drug, in comparison with that of ofloxacin, MICs for ofloxacin were generally one log2 higher for Gram negative bacilli and two log2 higher for Gram positive bacilli. Modal MICs for marbofloxacin were 0.12 mg/l for Clostridium perfringens, 0.5 mg/l for Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus strains, 1 mg/l for Bifidobacteria, 2 mg/l for non-fragilis members of the B. fragilis group, and 4 mg/l for C. difficile strains, respectively. It appears in vitro that Marbofloxacin was a more potent agent than ofloxacin on the whole anaerobes.
TI  - PCR detection and quantitation of predominant anaerobic bacteria in human and animal fecal samples.
AB  - PCR procedures based on 16S rRNA gene sequences specific for 12 anaerobic bacteria that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed and used for quantitative detection of these species in human (adult and baby) feces and animal (rat, mouse, cat, dog, monkey, and rabbit) feces. Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, and Clostridium clostridiiforme had high PCR titers (the maximum dilutions for positive PCR results ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-8)) in all of the human and animal fecal samples tested. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Eubacterium limosum also showed higher PCR titers (10(-2) to 10(-6)) in adult human feces. The other bacteria tested, including Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Eubacterium biforme, and Bacteroides distasonis, were either at low PCR titers (less than 10(-2)) or not detected by PCR. The reported PCR procedure including the fecal sample preparation method is simplified and rapid and eliminates the DNA isolation steps.
TI  - Amplified expression and large-scale purification of protein L'.
AB  - The gene fragment (PPL') encoding the functional unit of peptostreptococcus protein L was isolated using PCR and expressed in E. coli. As the gene fragment lacked its own promoter, the 5' PCR primer was designed to incorporate an Nde1 restriction site (CATATG) into the gene. This enabled the gene to be cloned in frame into an Nde1 restriction site immediately downstream of a trp promoter. To prevent read through, a stop codon was introduced into the 3' primer. Expression of PPL' was up to 27% total cell protein which compares favourably to the 0.1% total soluble cell protein obtained from the original clone of peptostreptococcus. Following a heat step homogeneous PPL' was recovered by a single anion-exchange chromatography step on Q-Sepharose FF in yields of 90%.
TI  - Pyomyositis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The author describes the microbiology and clinical features of six pyomyositis infections in children, which yielded anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they are mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 15 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic, 2 facultative). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (5 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Clostridium sp (2), Fuso-bacterium nucleatum (1), Prevotella sp (1), Bateroides sp (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Recent trauma or injury had occurred in five cases; three such injuries were from penetrating objects. This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with pyomyositis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected hemorrhoids.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected hemorrhoids. METHODS: Retrospective review of the clinical microbiology records. RESULTS: Aspirates of pus from infected hemorrhoids in 19 patients showed bacterial growth. Anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in six (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in one (5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 12 (63%). Sixty-eight isolates were recovered: 39 anaerobes (2.1 isolates per specimen) and 29 aerobes (1.5 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides sp. (13 isolates, including 10 Bacteroides fragilis groups) and 13 Peptostreptococcus sp. The predominant aerobes were Escherichia coli (7), Proteus sp. (5), group D streptococci (4), and Pseudomonas sp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in infected hemorrhoids.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - A study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  - Semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. The number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. Standard methods were used for the investigations. Five main genera of anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all patients. They included, the Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. Five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including Prevotella bivia, P. disiens, P. melanogenica, P. asaccharolytica and B. fragilis. The predominant flora was P. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. The semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). Similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Role of Escherichia coli P fimbriae in intestinal colonization in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - Adherence via P fimbriae is associated with long-term persistence of Escherichia  coli in the human large intestine, but a causal relationship has not been proven. In the present study, germfree rats were colonized with a mixture of two isogenic E. coli strains, one P fimbriated and the other type 1 fimbriated. Both types of fimbriae conferred adherence to rat colonic epithelial cells. With two mutant strains from a pyelonephritogenic isolate of serotype O75:K5:H-, the P-fimbriated strain 824 attained much higher numbers than its type 1-fimbriated counterpart when colonized in vivo for 2 weeks (10(10) versus 10(6) bacteria per g, respectively; P < 0.0001). The expression of P fimbriae by 824 was also retained during colonization. With transformant isogenic strains obtained from a normal fecal isolate incapable of phase variation, no benefit of P fimbriae was seen and most bacteria lost their plasmids during in vivo colonization. When the pyelonephritogenic mutant and fecal transformant strains were combined, the former colonized at high levels while the latter were suppressed. In contrast, no suppression was seen when the transformant E. coli strains colonized in combination with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Peptostreptococcus sp. The results indicate that P fimbriae, but also other bacterial traits linked to uropathogeneicity, could play an important role for persistence in the gut normal microbiota. Neither P nor type 1 fimbriae seemed to contribute to the ability to translocate to the mesenteric lymph nodes.
TI  - The GA module, a mobile albumin-binding bacterial domain, adopts a three-helix-bundle structure.
AB  - We present the first study of the secondary structure and global fold of an albumin-binding domain. Our data show that the GA module from protein PAB, an albumin-binding protein from the anaerobic bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus, is composed of a left-handed three-helix bundle. The helical regions were identified by sequential and medium range NOEs, values of NH-C alpha H coupling constants, chemical shift indices, and the presence of slowly exchanging amide protons, as determined by NMR spectroscopy. In addition, circular dichroism studies show that the module is remarkably stable with respect to both pH and temperature.
TI  - Microbiology of gastrostomy site wound infections in children.
AB  - Specimens of pus were obtained from gastrostomy site wound infections in 22 children. Polymicrobial flora was found in 21 of the 22 wounds. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were isolated in eight (36%) instances and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora were isolated from the other 14 (64%) wounds. A total of 102 bacterial isolates (57 aerobic and 45 anaerobic) and seven cultures of candida were obtained. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli (16 isolates). Peptostreptococcus spp. (14), Enterococcus spp. (14), Bacteroides spp. (12) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Twenty-eight strains producing beta-lactamase were isolated from 16 (73%) patients. The presence of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection, and the isolation of E. coli and Bacteroides spp. were more frequent in wounds with gastric leakage than in wounds without gastric leakage (p < 0.05). Bacteria similar to those isolated from the wound were also isolated from blood cultures from three patients-two isolates of E. coli and one each of B. fragilis and S. aureus. All patients received local therapy and 11 were treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. The polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of gastrostomy site wound infections, especially in association with gastric leakage, and the presence of beta-lactamase producers in most of these infections may have important implications for their management.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological features of necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - The microbiological and clinical characteristics of 83 patients with necrotizing  fasciitis (NF) treated over a period of 17 years are presented. Bacterial growth was noted in 81 of 83 (98%) of specimens from patients with NF. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 8 (10%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 18 (22%) specimens, and mixed-aerobic-anaerobic floras were recovered in 55 (68%) specimens. In total, there were 375 isolates, 105 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 270 anaerobic bacteria, for an average of 4.6 isolates per specimen. The recovery of certain bacteria from different anatomical locations correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. Anaerobic bacteria outnumbered aerobic bacteria at all body sites, but the highest recovery rate of anaerobes was in the buttocks, trunk, neck, external genitalia, and inguinal areas. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 14 isolates), Escherichia coli (n = 12), and group A streptococci (n = 8). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 101), Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (n = 40), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 36), and Clostridium spp. (n = 23). Certain clinical findings correlated with some bacteria: edema with B. fragilis group, Clostridium spp., S. aureus, Prevotella spp. and group A streptococci; gas and crepitation in tissues with members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium spp.; and foul odor with Bacteroides spp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with some organisms: trauma with Clostridium spp.; diabetes with Bacteroides spp., members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and S. aureus; and immunosuppression and malignancy with Pseudomonas spp. and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of NF.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. DESIGN: Of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64 needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. The microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). In total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. The predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. The highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia, and leg areas. Aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, and Clostridium sp. Certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with Clostridium sp, Prevotella sp, S aureus, and group A streptococci; regional adenopathy with B fragilis group; bulbous lesions with Enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group, Clostridium sp, and Enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with Bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp; diabetes with Bacteroides sp, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus; and burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.
TI  - The role of cefotaxime in the treatment of surgical infections.
AB  - This study examines the role of cefotaxime in the treatment of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive surgical infections. A dose of 2 g of cefotaxime will sustain peripheral compartment concentrations of 2.6, 3.9, 1.6, and 0.7 micrograms/ml for 6, 8, 10 and 12 h, respectively. Therefore, the proportion of pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) below the peripheral compartment cefotaxime concentrations was assessed as a measure of therapeutic potential. It was observed that bacterial elimination in infections correlates well with such pharmacodynamic predictions. Therefore, treatment recommendations for surgical infections are based on the following pharmacodynamics. The times above the MIC in the tissue compartment for various pathogens (1988-1994) known to cause surgical infections were: Escherichia coli, 12 h; all pyogenic streptococci, 12 h; pneumococci, 12 h; Haemophilus spp., 12 h; Proteus mirabilis, 12 h; Klebsiella spp., 10.9 h; viridans streptococci, 10.6 h; oxacillin-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 9.7 h; Providencia spp., 9.2 h; Clostridium perfringens, 8.6 h; Peptostreptococcus spp., 8 h; oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 7.3 h; and all S. aureus, 6.8 h. From the examination of pharmacodynamic parameters, cefotaxime appears to be a viable choice for the therapy of surgical infections other than the Gram-negative anaerobes. For those infections, metronidazole with cefotaxime would be preferred.
TI  - [Bone and joint infections due to unusual pathogens].
AB  - Between 1989 and 1993, 7 patients--2 men and 5 women from 19 to 70 years of age--with osteomyelitis due to an unusual organism were observed. 3 cases with Salmonella typhimurium and one at a time with Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium acnes and Pasteurella multocida. 5 patients were treated operative accompanied with antibiotics and 1 without operation. 1 patient declined the indicated surgical therapy. The outcome were total healing in 3 cases, healing with ankylosis of the concerning joints in 2 cases and healing with defect in 1 case.
TI  - Cloning, expression and purification of Ppl-1, a kappa-chain binding protein, based upon protein L from Peptostreptococcus magnus.
AB  - Protein L is a multi-domain, cell wall constituent of certain strains of Peptostreptococcus magnus, which binds to the variable domain of the L-chains of Ig. A gene fragment which codes for a single Ig-binding domain of protein L (Ppl-1) was cloned into a modified pKK223-3 vector and over-expressed in E. coli JM103. A rapid protein purification protocol is described. In these studies, purified Ppl-1 was immobilised on to an agarose gel and tested against an array of Igs and Ig fragments. It was found that Ppl-1-bound Igs from a number of different sources via interactions with the L kappa-chain. An enzyme linked immunosorbant assay has been developed to assay the binding of Ppl-1 to IgG. The incubation of Ppl-1 with human serum does not produce an immunoprecipitate, thus suggesting one unique interaction per binding domain which has been confirmed by ELISA. These experiments demonstrate the potential value of Ppl-1 as an immunological tool and as an affinity chromatography ligand for the purification of Igs.
TI  - Three-dimensional solution structure of an immunoglobulin light chain-binding domain of protein L. Comparison with the IgG-binding domains of protein G.
AB  - Protein L is a multidomain protein expressed at the surface of some strains of the anaerobic bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus. It has affinity for immunoglobulin (Ig) through interaction with framework structures in the variable Ig light chain domain. The Ig-binding activity is located to five homologous repeats called B1-B5 in the N-terminal part of the protein. We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the 76 amino acid residue long B1 domain using NMR spectroscopy and distance geometry-restrained simulated annealing. The domain is composed of a 15 amino acid residue long disordered N-terminus followed by a folded portion comprising an alpha-helix packed against a four-stranded beta-sheet. These secondary structural elements are well determined with a backbone atomic root mean square deviation from their mean of 0.54 A. The B domains of protein L show very limited sequence homology to the domains of streptococcal protein G interacting with the heavy chains of IgG. However, despite this fact, and their different binding properties, the fold of the B1 domain was found to be similar to the fold of the IgG-binding protein G domains [Wikstrom, M., Sjobring, U., Kastern, W., Bjorck, L., Drakenberg, T., & Forsen, S. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 3381-3386]. In the present study, the solution structure of the B1 domain enabled a more detailed comparison which can explain the different Ig-binding specificities of these two bacterial surface proteins. Among the differences observed, the alpha-helix orientation is the most striking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Prophylactic antibiotic treatment in therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ERCP:  results of a randomized controlled clinical study.
AB  - The present study evaluated the effects of prophylactic administration of cefotaxime in patients undergoing therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ERCP. One hundred patients were randomized to two groups of 50 patients each. Patients in group 1 received an intravenous infusion of 2 g cefotaxime 15 minutes before endoscopy; patients in group 2 did not receive an intravenous antibiotic before ERCP (control group). Blood samples were drawn for bacteriologic cultures before endoscopy and 5, 15, 30, and 120 minutes after beginning the procedure. Bacteremia was detected by blood cultures (15- and 30-minute samples) in 4 patients who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics (Escherichia coli in 2 cases, Peptostreptococcus in 1, and Staphylococcus aureus in 1). Cholangitis or sepsis did not occur after the bacteremic episodes in any of these patients. In 4 other patients who did not receive cefotaxime-all of whom had biliary obstruction-clinical cholangitis or sepsis developed during the 3-day follow-up; ERCP had failed to decompress the biliary system completely in these 4 cases. Blood cultures identified bacteria in 3 of these 4 patients (Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1, E. coli in 2). Thus, bacteremia or clinical sepsis developed in 8/50 patients (16%) in the control group without antibiotic prophylaxis, whereas no such episode was observed in patients who had received prophylactic treatment (chi 2 = 8.7; p < 0.01). The present results indicate that prophylactic administration of an antibiotic such as cefotaxime can reduce the incidence of bacteremia and sepsis in patients who undergo therapeutic or complicated diagnostic ERCP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The functional units of a peptostreptococcal protein L.
AB  - Protein L is a cell-surface protein from Peptostreptococcus which interacts with  immunoglobulin kappa light chains. A gene from Peptostreptococcus strain 3316 coding for protein L and fragments thereof were expressed in Escherichia coli. The peptides were examined for binding to immunoglobulin and serum albumin. The four C units were shown to be responsible for binding to immunoglobulin and the four D units for binding to albumin. This protein L molecule therefore binds to albumin at a site separate from that involved in binding to immunoglobulin. The albumin-binding units have high amino acid sequence identity with the albumin-binding units of streptococcal cell-surface proteins. The gene contains three sites available for internal initiation of translation resulting in three active proteins. The protein L molecule presented in this report was compared with a previously reported protein from Peptostreptococcus strain 312. The two proteins differ in several respects, including size and the number and types of repeat units.
TI  - In vitro comparison of the effectiveness of three surface disinfectants.
AB  - Choosing a general purpose surface disinfectant for the dental office environment is difficult because of the wide range of products available, varying claims by manufacturers and contradictory reports in the literature regarding product efficacy. This study tested the antimicrobial effectiveness of diluted-for-use O-phenyl-phenol (Omni), didecyl dimethyl ammonium (Basic G) and isopropanol (Virahol). Products were tested for antimicrobial activity at 0, 12 and 24 hours, 3, 6 and 8 days. O-phenyl-phenol demonstrated essentially no antibacterial effect against any of eleven test microorganisms. Didecyl dimethyl ammonium and the isopropanol reagent both demonstrated statistically significant killing activity against all organisms. More importantly, these two products maintained their antimicrobial activity up to 8 days after preparation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Protein PAB, a mosaic albumin-binding bacterial protein representing the first contemporary example of module shuffling.
AB  - Some strains of the anaerobic human commensal and pathogen Peptostreptococcus magnus bind human serum albumin (HSA), whereas other strains of this species express protein L, an immunoglobulin light chain-binding surface protein. A novel HSA-binding protein called protein PAB was purified in one step from the culture supernatant of an HSA-binding strain of P. magnus by affinity chromatography on HSA-Sepharose. The apparent size of the molecular was 47 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino acid sequence analysis of protein PAB demonstrated that the 4 NH2-terminal residues were identical to the corresponding sequence in protein L. In a polymerase chain reaction, oligonucleotides based on extragenic 5'- and 3'-end sequences of the protein L gene generated a product of the expected size: 1.3 kilobase pairs. A recombinant protein with retained albumin binding capacity was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the nucleotide sequence of the protein PAB gene was determined. The structural gene is 1161 nucleotides long, corresponding to a preprotein of 387 amino acids and a molecular mass of 43,043 Da. Unlike most other Gram-positive bacterial surface proteins described, protein PAB contains no internal homologies. However, substantial homologies were found to both proteins L and G (the IgG- and HSA-binding surface protein of group C and G streptococci). The derived amino acid sequence of the 135-base pair-long region homologous to protein G corresponds to the HSA-binding domain of that protein, and in protein PAB, this region is inserted between sequences showing extensive homology to COOH-terminal regions of peptostreptococcal protein L. This mosaic organization of protein PAB demonstrates that the molecule is a product of intergenic interspecies recombination of a functional domain into a common framework for peptostreptococcal surface proteins. Such an interspecies exchange of a functional protein module has previously not been described in prokaryotic cells.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Delta 22-beta-muricholic acid in monoassociated rats and conventional rats.
AB  - Bile acids were analyzed in the bile, small and large intestines, and feces of germ-free rats after a single inoculation with one of six intestinal bacteria that had been originally isolated from human feces. Bacteroides vulgatus and Bifidobacterium longum preferentially deconjugated tauro-beta-muricholic acid and taurocholic acid, respectively. Clostridium ramosum, Peptostreptococcus productus and Lactobacillus gasseri deconjugated both bile acids, but Escherichia coli did not deconjugate either one. Rats inoculated with bacteria that deconjugated tauro-beta-muricholic acid produced delta 22-beta-muricholic acid in the feces. In contrast, delta 22-cholic acid could not be detected in rats inoculated with bacteria that deconjugated taurocholic acid.
TI  - Piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. The Piperacillin/tazobactam Study Group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. METHODS: This was a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. Patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the United States and two hospitals in Canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. One group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. Therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. Cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. The most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). The most common microorganisms recovered included: Peptostreptococcus sp (99), Prevotella sp (87), black pigmented Bacteroides (29), B fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group B streptococcus (26), Escherichia coli (31), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and C trachomatis (19). A favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin patients. Among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. Diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; P = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. None of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. CONCLUSION: The combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.
TI  - Peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  - 680 Peptostreptococcus sp. (Ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. They included 103 Ps asaccharolyticus, 74 Ps magnus, 56 Ps prevotii, 51 Ps micros, 46 Ps anaerobius, 11 Ps morbilorum, and 10 Ps saccharolyticus. Most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), Ps were recovered in pure culture. Most Ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). Predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. These were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). The organisms most commonly isolated with Ps were Bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 B. fragilis group), Prevotella sp. (159), Fusobacterium sp. (122), Escherichia coli (114), and Staphylococcus aureus (97). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. Surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. These data illustrate the importance of Ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.
TI  - Effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. Two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. Septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. The parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. The most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. In both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. High mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly Escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides fragilis. All antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. Metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. The lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. Finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - L-serine and L-threonine dehydratase from Clostridium propionicum. Two enzymes with different prosthetic groups.
AB  - L-Serine dehydratase from the Gram-positive bacterium Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus is novel in the group of enzymes deaminating 2-hydroxyamino acids in that it is an iron-sulfur protein and lacks pyridoxal phosphate [Grabowski, R. and Buckel, W. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 199, 89-94]. It was proposed that this type of L-serine dehydratase is widespread among bacteria but has escaped intensive characterization due to its oxygen lability. Here, we present evidence that another Gram-positive bacterium, Clostridium propionicum, contains both an iron-sulfur-dependent L-serine dehydratase and a pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent L-threonine dehydratase. These findings support the notion that two independent mechanisms exist for the deamination of 2-hydroxyamino acids. L-Threonine dehydratase was purified 400-fold to apparent homogeneity and revealed as being a tetramer of identical subunits (m = 39 kDa). The purified enzyme exhibited a specific activity of 5 mu kat/mg protein and a Km for L-threonine of 7.7 mM. L-Serine (Km = 380 mM) was also deaminated, the V/Km ratio, however, being 118-fold lower than the one for L-threonine. L-Threonine dehydratase was inactivated by borohydride, hydroxylamine and phenylhydrazine, all known inactivators of pyridoxal-phosphate-containing enzymes. Incubation with NaB3H4 specifically labelled the enzyme. Activity of the phenylhydrazine-inactivated enzyme could be restored by pyridoxal phosphate. L-Serine dehydratase was also purified 400-fold, but its extreme instability did not permit purification to homogeneity. The enzyme was specific for L-serine (Km = 5 mM) and was inhibited by L-cysteine (Ki = 0.5 mM) and D-serine (Ki = 8 mM). Activity was insensitive towards borohydride, hydroxylamine and phenylhydrazine but was rapidly lost upon exposure to air. Fe2+ specifically reactivated the enzyme. L-Serine dehydratase was composed of two different subunits (alpha, m = 30 kDa; beta, m = 26 kDa), their apparent molecular masses being similar to the ones of the two subunits of the iron-sulfur-dependent enzyme from P. asaccharolyticus. Moreover, the N-terminal sequences of the small subunits from these two organisms were found to be 47% identical. In addition, 38% identity with the N-terminus of one of the two L-serine dehydratases of Escherichia coli was detected.
TI  - Intrapleural streptokinase in experimental empyema.
AB  - Intrapleural streptokinase has been used in multiloculated empyemas to enhance pleural space drainage, presumably by causing fibrinolysis of the interlocular septae. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily administration of 10,000 U intrapleural streptokinase or equal volumes of saline to enhance resolution of experimental empyema in the rabbit pleural space. Seventy-two hours after intrapleural turpentine, 10(8) colony-forming units each of Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides fragilis were injected into the sterile pleural effusion of all animals. Immediately after bacterial inoculation, and daily for 3 days, animals received 10,000 U streptokinase or saline intrapleurally. Animals that achieved a pleural fluid pH < 7.30 and either glucose < 50 mg/dl or LDH > 500 IU/L were included for data analysis. At Day 4 after bacterial inoculation, the streptokinase-treated empyemic rabbits had more pleural fluid (18.8 +/- 5.1 ml) (mean +/- SEM) than did saline-treated control animals (4.8 +/- 1.7 ml) (p = 0.015), fewer interpleural adhesions (8.2 +/- 2.7) than did saline-treated control animals (25.1 +/- 3.6) (p = 0.002), and comparable amounts of visceral and parietal pleural plaque than did saline-treated control animals (p = NS). No evidence of systemic fibrinolysis was observed at 1 h after intrapleural streptokinase administration. We conclude that intrapleural streptokinase decreases interpleural adhesion numbers but fails to reduce the amount of pleural plaque observed in experimental empyema in rabbits. The increases in pleural fluid volume observed after streptokinase administration may be due to mechanisms other than fibrinolytic activity.
TI  - [Studies on the locality and the function of spirosome in bacterial cells: relationship between the production of spirosome and anaerobic glycolysis].
AB  - The locality and the function of spirosome were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electron microscopy in Peptostreptococcus productus, Clostridium sp. HD-17, Lactobacillus fermentum, Eubacterium aerofaciens and Escherichia cali B. When the bacterial cells in phosphate buffered saline were disrupted by sonication and fractionated by differential centrifugation, the spirosome protein was found in the cytoplasmic fraction and not in the fraction of cell wall and cell membrane (the envelope fraction). The spirosome protein was found, however, in the envelope fraction when the bacterial cells were treated with a proper concentration of SDS. The spirosome protein in the envelope fraction disappeared after treatment with 2% Triton X-100 for 2 h. These results suggest that the spirosome protein anchored to the cell membrane upon SDS treatment. So it is presumed that the locality of spirosome is close to the cell membrane. Spirosome production increased in parallel to the concentration of glucose in the medium in obligate and aerotolerant anaerobes as well as in facultative anaerobes. This result indicates that the spirosome production was induced during the process of anaerobic glycolysis. Fructose as the sole carbon source in the minimal medium induced the spirosome production by E. coli as did glucose, but sodium pyruvate did not induce it either under aerobic or anaerobic condition.
TI  - Bacterial and fungal contamination of human fetal liver collected transvaginally  for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
AB  - Transplantation of fetal hematopoietic stem cells is a new therapy for fetuses diagnosed in utero with inherited disorders. However, prior to transplantation of fetal stem cells, the cells must be free of microbial contamination. In order to investigate the contamination of human fetal liver tissue, we determined the rate and types of bacterial and fungal contamination of human fetal liver tissue collected transvaginally for use in stem cell transplantation by using the US Pharmacopoiea Assay. We found a high rate of contamination with bacteria or fungi (12 of the 14 fetal livers, or 85%). Non-fermenting gram-negative rods were the predominant contaminants. The high rate of microbial contamination of fetal tissue suggests that techniques for tissue collection need to be improved before fetal stem cells are used for clinical transplantation.
TI  - Protein LG: a hybrid molecule with unique immunoglobulin binding properties.
AB  - Immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding bacterial proteins have attracted theoretical interest for their role in molecular host-parasite interactions, and they are widely used as tools in immunology, biochemistry, medicine, and biotechnology. Protein L of the anaerobic bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus binds Ig light chains, whereas streptococcal protein G has affinity for the constant (Fc) region of IgG. In this report, Ig binding parts of protein L and protein G were combined to form a hybrid molecule, protein LG, which was found to bind a large majority of intact human Igs as well as Fc and Fab fragments, and Ig light chains. Binding to Ig was specific, and the affinity constants of the reactions between protein LG and human IgG, IgGFc fragments, and kappa light chains, determined by Scatchard plots, were 5.9 x 10(9), 2.2 x 10(9), and 2.0 x 10(9) M-1, respectively. The binding properties of protein LG were more complete as compared with previously described Ig-binding proteins when also tested against mouse and rat Igs. This hybrid protein thus represents a powerful tool for the binding, detection, and purification of antibodies and antibody fragments.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - [Experience with the management of endometritis in the Instituto Nacional de Perinatalogia].
AB  - Endometritis is the most frequent infectious complication of the puerperal period; with the objective to know the clinical characteristics, etiology and evolution of this disease we did a retrospective study of the endometritis cases among the patients of the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia (INPer) from January 1st, 1990 to May 31, 1991. During the revision period were diagnosed 120 cases, but we were able to examine only 90. In the 90% the resolution of the pregnancy was by means of caesarean. A 24.4% of the patients had premature rupture of the membranes. The 10% had diagnose of chorioamniotis. The latency period to develop postpartum endometritis was 120 +/- 66 hours, and post-caesarean 56 +/- 30 hours (p = 0.001). The symptom most frequent were fever (100), foul-smelling lochia (61.1%) and uterine tenderness (60%). The infection was polymicrobial, being the microorganisms most frequent isolated Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Escherichia coli and Peptostreptococcus. A 3.3% developed pelvi-peritonitis. One patient died.
TI  - Microbiology of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
AB  - Specimens obtained from 67 infants with secondarily infected diaper dermatitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacteria growth was obtained in 58. Aerobic facultative bacteria or Candida sp. only were present in 28 patients (48%), anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (19%), and mixed anaerobic with aerobic, facultative, or yeast flora was present in 19 (33%). Ninety-one bacterial or fungal isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 54 (0.9 per specimen) aerobic or facultative bacteria, 8 (0.1 per specimen) Candida sp., and 31 (0.6 per specimen) strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), Streptococcus sp. (16), and Escherichia coli (6). The predominant anaerobes included Bacteroides sp. (12, including 9 Bacteroides fragilis group) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (11). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 32 (55%) patients, 18 of which were S. aureus. Twenty-five beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 22 (51%) of the 43 tested patients. These included 16 S. aureus and 6 B. fragilis group. These data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial nature of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis of the neck and chest. Report of a case.
AB  - A case is presented of necrotizing fasciitis of the neck and chest characterized  by rapid progressive necrosis of subcutaneous tissue, fascia and skin. The diagnosis and management is discussed.
TI  - Isolation and identification of intestinal bacteria from Japanese tree frog (Hlya japonica) with the special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The bacteria in the large intestines of eight Japanese tree frogs (Hlya japonica) were enumerated by using an anaerobic culture system. The microorganisms at approximately 3.1 x 10(9) bacteria per g (wet weight) of intestinal contents were present in the intestine of all the frogs tested. No difference of the total bacteria in the frog intestine was observed between two different incubation-temperatures (room temperature and 37 degrees C). Eleven genera and 16 species were isolated from the frog intestine. In most frogs, Bacteroides (B.) caccae and B. vulgatus were detected as the predominant organisms. Escherichia coli was also present in greater numbers in the intestine. Other bacteria isolated at high dilutions were strict anaerobes, including Fusobacterium and Clostridium. Enterococcus faecalis was frequently isolated from the frog intestine. However, four genera of Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Lactobacillus were not isolated from the frog intestine.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - Structure of peptostreptococcal protein L and identification of a repeated immunoglobulin light chain-binding domain.
AB  - The gene for protein L, an immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain-binding protein expressed by some strains of the anaerobic bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus, was cloned and sequenced. The gene translates into a protein of 719 amino acid residues. Following a signal sequence of 18 amino acids and a NH2-terminal region ("A") of 79 residues, the molecule contains five homologous "B" repeats of 72-76 amino acids each. Further, toward the COOH terminus, two additional repeats ("C") were found. These are not related to the "B" repeats, but are highly homologous to each other. After the C repeats (52 amino acids each), a hydrophilic, proline-rich putative cell wall-spanning region ("W") was found, followed at the COOH-terminal end by a hydrophobic membrane anchor ("M"). Fragments of the gene were expressed, and the corresponding peptides were analyzed for Ig-binding activity. The B repeats were found to be responsible for the interaction with Ig light chains. An Escherichia coli high level expression system was adapted for the production of large amounts of two Ig-binding protein L fragments comprising one and four B repeats, respectively.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis of the vulva.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We attempted to characterize the natural history of necrotizing fasciitis of the vulva. STUDY DESIGN: The records of 29 nonpregnant women with necrotizing fasciitis of the vulva were evaluated. RESULTS: These women experienced a rapidly progressing polymicrobial infection. Initially, the infections in many women were thought to be labial cellulitis, appearing mild and innocuous. Delays in recognition and aggressive surgical management were associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Of 15 women with a delay greater than 48 hours between presentation and treatment, 11 died. Twenty of 29 (69%) were diabetic, accounting for 11 of the 14 deaths. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical debridement in spite of mild symptoms will improve outcome in this serious disease process.
TI  - The relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  - Lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. The role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. Vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of H2O2-positive and H2O2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. Compared with women with H2O2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized by H2O2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and viridans streptococci (P less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). In addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with H2O2-positive lactobacilli to have Chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by Enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (P less than .05 for each comparison). Vaginal colonization by group B streptococci or Escherichia coli was not related to the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli. These data suggest that the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.
TI  - The effect of amoxycillin on vaginal colonization resistance and normal vaginal flora in monkeys.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that vaginal colonization resistance in monkeys can be eliminated by amoxycillin and restored by flushing vaginal flora from a healthy monkey into the vagina of a monkey colonized with Escherichia coli. The hypothesis that the effect of amoxycillin resulted from elimination of parts of the normal flora was tested in the present study. Nine monkeys were flushed vaginally with amoxycillin daily for six days. The number of anaerobic bacteria decreased during amoxycillin administration, as did the number of species isolated. The most obvious effects were observed among the genera Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus, while Lactobacillus spp. were less affected. Restoration of the flora after amoxycillin administration was slow in most of the monkeys. During amoxycillin administration, all monkeys became colonized spontaneously with E. coli. This was not, however, associated with increased adherence in vitro. The colonization persisted throughout the study period (29 days). It was concluded that amoxycillin disturbs vaginal colonization resistance by eliminating at least part of the normal vaginal flora, thereby promoting periurethral colonization with enterobacteria.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Asporogenic anaerobic thoracic empyema--an experimental model for anaerobic thoracic empyema in rabbits].
AB  - Sterile pleural effusion was induced by intrapleural administration of turpentine, and empyema was induced by direct intrapleural inoculation of bacteria in rabbits. Experimental models of anaerobic thoracic empyema were successfully made in this study, using Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Bacteroides fragilis, using the following methods; (1) a single bacterium inoculation of, a) E. coli, b) P. asaccharolyticus, c) B. fragilis, (2) simultaneous inoculations with an aerobe and an anaerobe, a) E. coli + P. asaccharolyticus, b) E. coli + B. fragilis. (3) an anaerobic inoculation 5 days after an aerobic inoculation, a) P. asaccharolyticus inoculation 5 days after E. coli inoculation, b) B. fragilis inoculation 5 days after E. coli inoculation. The developments of several parameters (sialic acid levels, glucose levels, oxidation-reduction potential levels, bacterial counts and WBC counts in the pleural fluid and so on) were measured in each group. There was little difference of the rate of incidence of empyema between each group. Empyema was highly induced even by a single anaerobe inoculation. The following tendencies were observed in development of parameters: (1) sialic acid levels and oxidation-reduction potential levels were decreased only in the conditions being associated by B. fragilis infections. (2) in mixed infections of E. coli and anaerobes, bacterial counts of E. coli increased in number in the late phases of the infections probably by the influences of anaerobes. The experiments of groups (2) and (3) were designed for demonstrations of biphasic infections between aerobes and anaerobes, but it turned out that quite unexpected results were seen in these models.
TI  - The partial amino acid sequence of the NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Clostridium symbiosum: implications for the evolution and structural basis of coenzyme specificity.
AB  - The amino acid sequence is reported for CNBr and tryptic peptide fragments of the NAD(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Clostridium symbiosum. Together with the N-terminal sequence, these make up about 75% of the total sequence. The sequence shows extensive similarity with that of the NADP(+)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli (52% identical residues out of the 332 compared) allowing confident placing of the peptide fragments within the overall sequence. This demonstrated sequence similarity with the E. coli enzyme, despite different coenzyme specificity, is much greater than the similarity (31% identities) between the GDH's of C. symbiosum and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, both NAD(+)-linked. The evolutionary implications are discussed. In the 'fingerprint' region of the nucleotide binding fold the sequence Gly X Gly X X Ala is found, rather than Gly X Gly X X Gly. The sequence found here has previously been associated with NADP+ specificity and its finding in a strictly NAD(+)-dependent enzyme requires closer examination of the function of this structural motif.
TI  - Microbiologic causes and neonatal outcomes associated with chorioamnion infection.
AB  - Chorioamnion infection is associated with histologic chorioamnionitis and prematurity, but the specific chorioamnion microorganisms associated with histologic chorioamnionitis, prematurity, and poor neonatal outcome have not been identified. Bacteria were recovered from the chorioamnion cultures of 32% of 112 placentas delivered at less than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation and from 19% of 156 placentas delivered at greater than 34 weeks' gestation (odds ratio 2.1; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 3.8). Chorioamnion bacteria most highly related to both prematurity and histologic chorioamnionitis were group B Streptococcus and Fusobacterium species. Chorioamnion infection with Peptostreptococcus was significantly related only to preterm delivery, and infection with Escherichia coli, Bacteroides, and Ureaplasma were significantly related to histologic chorioamnionitis. Among preterm infants, isolation of bacteria from the chorioamnion was related to an increased risk of neonatal death (rate ratio 3.8; 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 11.6). Bacterial infection of the chorioamnion is related to preterm birth, histologic chorioamnionitis, and neonatal death.
TI  - Selection, expression, and nucleotide sequencing of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene of Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus.
AB  - The gene for the catabolic NAD-linked glutamate dehydrogenase of Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus was cloned by selection of Escherichia coli for complementation of a biosynthetic defect. Cloned fragments containing the gene and the P. asaccharolyticus transcription and translation signals are very highly expressed in E. coli. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene was determined. It codes for a polypeptide of 421 amino acids, the sequence of which is similar to those of the NADP-accepting glutamate dehydrogenases. The sequence similarity of this protein to the mammalian glutamate dehydrogenases, which accept both NADP and NAD, is greater than its similarity to the bacterial NADP-specific dehydrogenases, suggesting that this NAD-specific bacterial glutamate dehydrogenase and the NADP-specific bacterial dehydrogenases diverged separately from the line leading to the dual-specificity mammalian glutamate dehydrogenases.
TI  - Normal vaginal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta).
AB  - The most common bacterial species isolated from the vaginas of 37 healthy rhesus  macaques were Streptococcus viridans, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Mobiluncus curtisii ss. curtisii, Corynebacterium renale-like organisms, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Gardnerella-like organisms, and other Corynebacterium species. The vaginal flora of the rhesus macaque differs from that previously reported for five other primate species. A two-year retrospective review of clinical cases of vaginitis and metritis found Escherichia coli and coagulase positive Staphylococci to be the most common pathogens isolated.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - The importance of positive bacterial cultures of specimens obtained during clean  orthopaedic operations.
AB  - Microbiological cultures of specimens of tissue and of fluids from the wound in forty patients who had had consecutive clean, elective orthopaedic operations (excluding total joint replacements) and had not received antibiotics preoperatively were analyzed. Of the forty patients, twenty-three (58 per cent) had a positive culture on at least one of the media that were used and seventeen (43 per cent) had negative cultures. Of the forty specimens that were obtained from swabbing of the wound, eight (20 per cent) were positive on culture, compared with twenty (50 per cent) that were obtained from biopsy of tissue. Of these twenty-eight positive cultures, thirteen (46 per cent) were on routine blood-agar plates and fifteen (54 per cent), in broth only. Of the thirty-three bacterial organisms that were identified in the twenty-eight positive cultures of the wound, nineteen (58 per cent) were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; eight (24 per cent), Propionibacterium acnes; two (6 per cent), Peptostreptococcus; and four (12 per cent), miscellaneous organisms. In all of the positive cultures on the blood-agar plates, except in those showing Propionibacterium acnes, there were five colonies or fewer. One patient had a clinical infection with Staphylococcus aureus that developed later, but the initial cultures of the wound had been positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis only. None of the bacteria that grew on culture were Staphylococcus aureus or the less common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, or Klebsiella.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Vaginal Bacteroides species are associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery among women in preterm labor.
AB  - The relationship of high concentrations of vaginal microorganisms with an increased rate of preterm delivery (less than or equal to 34 weeks) among women in preterm labor was evaluated. Quantitative vaginal cultures were obtained from 211 women in preterm labor between gestational ages of 22 and 34 completed weeks. Preterm delivery occurred in 139 (66%). The rate of preterm delivery was determined by Cox proportional hazards models. Women with greater than 10(7) cfu/ml of vaginal fluid of facultative lactobacilli had a 40% decreased rate of preterm delivery (rate ratio [RR] = 0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-0.9). An increased rate of preterm delivery occurred among women with Bacteroides bivius at concentrations of greater than 10(4) cfu/ml (RR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4-2.9) and Bacteroides fragilis (RR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8). Other microorganisms, including Gardernella vaginalis, the genital mycoplasmas, group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Peptostreptococcus species, were not associated with an increased rate of preterm delivery for women in preterm labor.
TI  - Molecular fingerprinting of isolates of the genus Peptostreptococcus using rRNA genes from Escherichia coli and P. anaerobius.
AB  - Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of rRNA genes were evaluated as a tool for intra- and interspecies differentiation of Peptostreptococcus isolates. RFLPs from a collection of 20 clinical isolates and five ATCC strains representing five Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros and P. prevotii) were obtained by hybridization of Southern blots of HindIII- or EcoRI-digested genomic DNA with three probes: probe A, a 0.98 kb HindIII fragment with a partial 16S rRNA gene sequence from P. anaerobius ATCC 27337; probe B, cloned Escherichia coli rrnB operon in plasmid pKK3535; and probe C, E. coli 16S and 23S rRNA. The hybridization patterns varied, but all yielded RFLPs useful for both intra- and inter-species differentiation. RFLPs of P. asaccharolyticus clinical isolates were closely related to each other and differed significantly from those of the ATCC type strains. The profiles of P. prevotii differed from those of the other four species studied, and based on the HindIII- and EcoRI-generated RFLPs, the strains in this species are more heterogeneous than the other four species studied.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of CPFX against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. The clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. Interpreting MIC level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. When activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, CPFX expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (OFLX) and norfloxacin (NFLX) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of CPFX against Bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of OFLX, and CPFX had similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus to OFLX. 2. In comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, CPFX was inferior to amoxicillin (AMPC) against E. faecalis and inferior to AMPC and cefaclor (CCL) against Peptostreptococcus spp. Against all other bacterial species, however, CPFX expressed superior antibacterial potency to AMPC and CCL. 3. Scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to CPFX were observed among the S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. faecium, P. vulgaris, M. morganii, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of E. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
TI  - Microbial aspects of failing osseointegrated dental implants in humans.
AB  - The subgingival microflora of 18 failing implants were examined for pathogenic periodontal microorganisms. Peptostreptococcus micros was recovered from 6 failing implants, Wolinella recta from 6, Fusobacterium species from 5, Candida albicans from 5, and Bacteroides intermedius from 4. Enteric rods or pseudomonads constituted a significant part of the microflora in 5 failing implants. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, nonpigmented Bacteroides species, Capnocytophage species, and staphylococci were detected in a few implant failures. The present study showed that a complex microflora comprising oral as well as primarily non oral organisms, and bacteria as well as yeasts, can be associated with failing implants. This great diversity in microbial composition and antimicrobial susceptibility among "peri-implantitis" isolates suggest that antimicrobial therapies for implant failures should not be implemented without a prior comprehensive microbiological analysis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of wounds and cutaneous abscesses.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of 584 wounds and 676 skin or soft-tissue abscesses were studied and correlated with the infection site. In wounds, aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 223 specimens (38%), anaerobes only in 177 specimens (30%), and mixed flora in 184 specimens (32%). In total there were 1470 isolates, 558 aerobic and 912 anaerobic, an average of 2.5 isolates per wound (1.6 anaerobic and 0.9 aerobic isolates). In abscesses, aerobic or facultative bacteria were recovered in 177 specimens (26%), anaerobes only in 243 specimens (36%), and mixed flora in 256 specimens (38%). In total there were 1702 isolates, 602 aerobic and 1100 anaerobic, an average of 2.5 isolates per abscess. The highest rates of anaerobes in wounds were in the inguinal, buttocks, and trunk areas and in abscesses in the perirectal, external genitalia, neck, and inguinal areas. The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (363 isolates), group A streptococci (98 isolates), and Escherichia coli (97 isolates). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides species (986 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (559 isolates), Clostridium species (153 isolates), and Fusobacterium species (109 isolates). The predominance of certain isolates in certain anatomical sites was correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of wounds and cutaneous abscesses.
TI  - Intra-abdominal abscess in children: a 13-year experience.
AB  - The microbiology of intra-abdominal abscess in children is similar to that of adults--a mixture of aerobes and anaerobes. In abscess specimens taken from 36 children, predominant pathogens were Bacteroides fragilis group species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbiologic efficacy of intravaginal clindamycin cream for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by replacement of the normal Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora with Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and Mycoplasma hominis. The present study evaluated the vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. Sixty-seven nonpregnant women with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis, and without other genital tract infections, were randomly assigned to receive placebo cream or 0.1, 1, or 2% clindamycin cream. Quantitative vaginal cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria and genital mycoplasmas were performed at enrollment and at 4-7 days and 4-5 weeks after completion of therapy. At enrollment, G vaginalis was recovered from 99%, Bacteroides sp from 94%, Peptostreptococcus sp from 81%, and M hominis from 58% of the 67 women with bacterial vaginosis. The vaginal cultures yielded a median of 12 isolates per specimen, with equal numbers of aerobic and anaerobic species. The mean log concentration was 1.2 X 10(9) cfu/mL for aerobic and 2.6 X 10(8) cfu/mL for anaerobic bacteria. After treatment, the frequency and concentration of bacteria per milliliter of vaginal fluid decreased for G vaginalis, Bacteroides sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, and M hominis. The 2% clindamycin cream had the greatest effect on the bacterial vaginosis-associated flora and resulted in clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis in 15 (94%) of 16 women. Treatment with lower concentrations of clindamycin cream had less effect on the vaginal flora and resulted in clinical cure in 25 (71%) of 35 women. Therapy was associated with an increase in the frequency and concentration of Lactobacillus, and a probably transient increase in the frequency of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Clinical, pathologic, and microbiologic findings of foot abscess in neonatal pigs.
AB  - A longitudinal study was undertaken in a swine herd with an ever-present problem  of foot abscess in suckling pigs reared on a woven-wire floor. Of 3,322 4-day-old pigs, 199 (6%) developed abscess lesions involving claws and accessory digits before weaning. Lesions were first detected in 4-day-old pigs; median and mean ages at onset were 10 and 11.3 days, respectively. At first detection, most pigs had only a single claw affected, but 39 pigs had at least 2 claws with abscesses. Hind limbs had more affected claws (140) than forelimbs (96). In the hind limbs, medial claws were most likely to have lesions, whereas the reverse was true for the forelimbs. Gross and microscopic examinations of affected claws indicated necrotic pododermatitis, with severe osteomyelitis, arthritis, and tenosynovitis. Bacteria isolated from foot abscess lesions included Actinomyces pyogenes, Staphylococcus spp, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp, Actinobacillus spp, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium spp, Bacteroides spp, and Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Purification of NADPH-dependent electron-transferring flavoproteins and N-terminal protein sequence data of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases from anaerobic, glycine-utilizing bacteria.
AB  - Three electron-transferring flavoproteins were purified to homogeneity from anaerobic, amino acid-utilizing bacteria (bacterium W6, Clostridium sporogenes, and Clostridium sticklandii), characterized, and compared with the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase of Eubacterium acidaminophilum. All the proteins were found to be dimers consisting of two identical subunits with a subunit Mr of about 35,000 and to contain about 1 mol of flavin adenine dinucleotide per subunit. Spectra of the oxidized proteins exhibited characteristic absorption of flavoproteins, and the reduced proteins showed an A580 indicating a neutral semiquinone. Many artificial electron acceptors, including methyl viologen, could be used with NADPH as the electron donor but not with NADH. Unlike the enzyme of E. acidaminophilum, which exhibited by itself a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase activity (W. Freudenberg, D. Dietrichs, H. Lebertz, and J. R. Andreesen, J. Bacteriol. 171:1346-1354, 1989), the electron-transferring flavoprotein purified from bacterium W6 reacted with lipoamide only under certain assay conditions, whereas the proteins of C. sporogenes and C. sticklandii exhibited no dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase activity. The three homogeneous electron-transferring flavoproteins were very similar in their structural and biochemical properties to the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase of E. acidaminophilum and exhibited cross-reaction with antibodies raised against the latter enzyme. N-terminal sequence analysis demonstrated a high degree of homology between the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase of E. acidaminophilum and the electron-transferring flavoprotein of C. sporogenes to the thioredoxin reductase of Escherichia coli. Unlike these proteins, the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases purified from the anaerobic, glycine-utilizing bacteria Peptostreptococcus glycinophilus, Clostridium cylindrosporum, and C. sporogenes exhibited a high homology to dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenases known from other organisms.
TI  - Cerebral ventriculitis: MR findings.
AB  - Cerebral ventriculitis is an uncommon site and manifestation of infection of the  central nervous system. We report the magnetic resonance findings in two patients with cytologic and CSF culture proof of ventriculitis. The findings included abnormal signal intensity of the ependyma and CSF on T2-weighted images. In addition, ependymal, meningeal, and dural enhancement was seen in one case, on T1-weighted images, after administration of Gd-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid.
TI  - The bacteriology of gangrenous and perforated appendicitis--revisited.
AB  - By using optimum sampling, transport, and culture techniques in patients with gangrenous or perforated appendicitis, we recovered than has previously been reported. Thirty patients older than 12 years with histologically documented gangrenous or perforated appendicitis had peritoneal fluid, appendiceal tissue, and abscess contents (if present) cultured. Appendiceal tissue was obtained so as to exclude the lumen. A total of 223 anaerobes and 82 aerobic or faculatative bacteria were recovered, an average of 10.2 different organisms per specimen. Twenty-one different genera and more than 40 species were encountered. Bacteroides fragilis group and Escherichia coli were isolated from almost all specimens. Within the B. fragilis group, eight species were represented. Other frequent isolates included Peptostreptococcus (80%), Pseudomonas (40% [P. aeruginosa, 23.3%, other Pseudomonas spp., 16.7%]), B. splanchnicus (40%), B. intermedius (36.7%), and Lactobacillus (36.7%). Interestingly a previously undescribed fastidious gram-negative anaerobic bacillus was isolated from nearly one half of all patients. This organism was found to have low DNA homology (by dot blot) with the known organisms most closely resembling it.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of intra-abdominal abscesses in children.
AB  - In this study of the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of 23 intra-abdominal abscesses, aerobic bacteria alone were present in one specimen, anaerobic bacteria only in four, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 18. Ninety bacterial isolates (3.9 isolates per specimen), 63 anaerobic (2.7 per specimen), and 27 aerobic and facultative (1.2 per specimen) isolates were recovered. The predominant organisms were Bacteroides fragilis group (23 isolates), Peptostreptococcus sp (20 isolates), and Escherichia coli (15 isolates). This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic etiology of intra-abdominal abscesses in children.
TI  - Microbiology of infected epidermal cysts.
AB  - Specimens from 231 epidermal cyst abscesses were inoculated on media supportive for growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Of these, 192 yielded bacterial growth. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 84 specimens (44%), anaerobic bacteria only in 57 specimens (30%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 51 specimens (26%). A total of 315 isolates (162 anaerobes and 153 aerobes) were recovered. An average of 0.8 aerobic or facultative isolates per infected cyst were recovered, and this number was unrelated to the cysts' anatomic sites. However, the number of anaerobic bacteria varied; they were isolated more frequently in perirectal (1.5 isolates per specimen), vulvovaginal (1.4), and head (1.1) infections, and less frequently in trunk (0.7) and extremities (0.4) infections. The predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (81 isolates), group A streptococcus (9 isolates), and Escherichia coli (7 isolates). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Peptostreptococcus species (85 isolates) and Bacteroides species (55 isolates, including 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus and 9 Bacteroides fragilis groups). The study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cyst abscesses in the perirectal, vulvovaginal, and head areas.
TI  - A 12 year study of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in intra-abdominal and postsurgical abdominal wound infections.
AB  - Findings from the study of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in intra-abdominal infections from 339 specimens of the peritoneal cavity after intestinal perforation, 83 specimens from abdominal abscesses and 89 specimens from postsurgical abdominal wounds are presented. Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 43 (13 per cent) of the peritoneal specimens, aerobic bacteria alone in 38 (11 per cent) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 258 (76 per cent). A total of 985 bacterial isolates were recovered in peritoneal specimens (2.9 per specimen), with 436 aerobes (1.3 per specimen) and 549 anaerobes (1.6 per specimen). Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 13 (16 per cent) of 83 specimens from abdominal abscesses, aerobes alone in two (2 per cent) and mixed flora in 68 (82 per cent). A total of 235 bacterial isolates were recovered in abdominal abscesses--128 anaerobes (1.5 per specimen) and 107 aerobes (1.3 per specimen). Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 11 (12 per cent) of 89 specimens from abdominal wounds, aerobic only in ten (11 per cent) and mixed flora in 68 (76 per cent). A total of 258 isolates were recovered (2.9 per specimen)--137 anaerobes (1.5 per specimen) and 121 aerobes or facultatives (1.4 per specimen). The predominant aerobes and facultatives in abdominal infections were Escherichia coli and Streptococcus species. The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus and Clostridium species. Recovered were 334 isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group--222 in peritoneal cultures, 63 in abscesses and 49 in wounds. Of the B. fragilis group, B. fragilis accounted for 129 (58 per cent) of isolates in peritoneal aspirates, 45 (75 per cent) in aspirates from abscesses and 30 (61 per cent) in wounds. Results from this study demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic cause and importance of all members of the B. fragilis group in intra-abdominal postsurgical infections.
TI  - Colony counts and characterization of bacteria adherent to the rumen wall and desquamated epithelial cells in conventional young lambs.
AB  - Characterization and enumeration of the adherent epimural community of the rumen  wall of young, conventionally reared lambs were carried out from 2 to 21 days after birth. Three hundred strains were isolated by anaerobic procedures from three sites: dorsal, ventral, and caudal sacs, and from the sloughed epithelial cells. The population of epimural bacteria was very dense from the first days of the lamb's life. This population increased slightly with age. During the first week the counts were similar in the dorsal and ventral sacs, but they were 10 to 100 times lower in the caudal sac. Total counts for anaerobic bacteria were higher than the counts for aerobic bacteria. The isolated strains were distributed into 19 groups: 11 groups included aerotolerant strains, and 8 others, strictly anaerobic strains. During the first week the facultative microflora was mainly composed of Escherichia coli and Streptococci. Later, the epimural community was more complex and included Staphyloccus, Micrococcus, and Gaffkya. The strictly anaerobic microflora was mainly composed of Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella, Propionibacterium, and Acidaminococcus. Some of these strains appeared to be similar to those previously isolated from the rumen fluid of young lambs; however, the genera Micrococcus, Veillonella, Gaffkya, and Acidaminococcus, and E. coli seemed to be specific of the rumen wall tissues.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of Bartholin's abscess.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from an abscess of Bartholin's gland in 28 patients were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was obtained on culture in 26 specimens. A total of 67 bacterial isolates (43 anaerobic and 24 aerobic and facultative) were recovered, accounting for 2.6 isolates per specimen (1.7 anaerobic and 0.9 aerobic and facultatives). Anaerobic bacteria only were present in eight patients, aerobic and facultatives in five and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 13. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in six infections. The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides species (23 isolates, including six Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, five Bacteroides fragilis group and four Bacteroides bivius) and Peptostreptococcus species. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In this study, the polymicrobial nature of abscess of Bartholin's gland is highlighted.
TI  - Intravenous sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - A total of 82 patients involving 83 episodes of proven or presumed bacterial infection were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin. These included 36 cases of soft tissue infection or abscess, four cases of joint or bone infection, 20 cases of respiratory tract infection (17 cases of pneumonia, two of otitis media, and one of tonsillitis), 15 urinary tract infections, three cases of enterocolitis, one case of infective endocarditis, two cases of septicemia, and two of peritonitis. The causative pathogen was isolated in 48 cases (49 infections). These pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus 13 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis one, Streptococcus pyogenes two, Streptococcus pneumoniae two, Viridans group streptococcus two, peptostreptococcus one, Haemophilus influenzae one, Escherichia coli 12, Enterobacter cloacae three, Proteus mirabilis one, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus one, Salmonella spp. two, Shigella sonnei one, Bacteroides fragilis one, and polymicrobial infections of various combinations in five cases. No bacterial pathogens were isolated in 34 infections, 14 cases of pneumonia and 15 soft tissue infections. Sulbactam/ampicillin was given by intravenous bolus in a dosage range of 75-450 mg/kg/day in four divided doses for variable periods of time depending on the type and severity of the infection. Of a total of 83 episodes of infections, 80 (96.4%) cases were either cured or improved. Bacteriologic eradication also occurred in 46 (93.9%) of 49 infections. Side effects were diarrhea in two patients, acute hemolytic anemia in one patient, and transient elevations in SGOT and leukopenia in one patient. Side effects disappeared upon completion of treatment. Sulbactam/ampicillin is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of common pediatric infections.
TI  - Bacteriotherapy for chronic relapsing Clostridium difficile diarrhoea in six patients.
AB  - Six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by Clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in sterile saline (five patients). The mixture led to a prompt loss of Cl difficile and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by Bacteroides sp, which had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. Strains of Escherichia coli, Cl bifermentans, and Peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of Cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The finding that Bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was present after recovery suggests that the absence of Bacteroides sp may result in chronic relapsing Cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by Cl difficile.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Chemotaxis inhibition by Gardnerella vaginalis and succinate producing vaginal anaerobes: composition of vaginal discharge associated with G vaginalis.
AB  - The influence of six succinate producing vaginal anaerobes and Gardnerella vaginalis on the chemotactic activity of granulocytes was studied by the under agarose method. G vaginalis, Mobiluncus species, and three Gram negative anaerobes elicited hardly any response, but Peptostreptococcus productus showed clear positive chemotaxis, as did the Escherichia coli strain used as a control. Inhibition of the chemotactic response of white blood cells was found with all strains, but the high succinate producers from the genus Bacteroides showed the most pronounced effect. The inhibition of chemotaxis by succinate producing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of non-specific vaginitis (NSV) is postulated, and B ureolyticus or Mobiluncus spp, rather than G vaginalis, are suggested as possible causes of NSV.
TI  - Intestinal perforation in children.
AB  - There were 102 cases of intestinal perforation seen in children at the Department of Paediatric Surgery at S.S. Hospital, Varanasi during a 3 year period. Enteric (typhoid) perforation (29%), intussusception (15%) Ascaris lumbricoides infestation (9%) and appendicitis (9%), which are rarities in the reported literature, were the major causes of intestinal perforation. Radiological evidence of pneumoperitoneum was seen in 88% of patients. The majority of cases in this study were older than 5 years of age (48%). Peritoneal fluid culture revealed Escherichia coli and Klebsiella to be the most common aerobic micro-organisms, while Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridia and Peptostreptococcus were the most frequent anaerobes. The overall mortality rate was high (19%).
TI  - Coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. III. Microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  - The coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. All microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. The MIC90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine are as follows: Staphylococcus aureus 1.0, Streptococcus pyogenes 8, Enterobacteriaceae 2.0, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli 1, Legionella pneumophila 8, Haemophilus influenzae 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some Peptostreptococcus strains. The aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, P. aeruginosa BMH 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (MIC 0.2 micrograms/ml). Coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for S. aureus. The viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the MIC (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. The frequency of resistance development was less than 1 X 10(-9) for Escherichia coli and S. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the MIC. The Cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. Coumamidine is stable in serum. In mouse protection tests against S. aureus NCTC 10649 the ED50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. Coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. The antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology. Study group of cefuzonam in the field of obstetrics and gynecological infections].
AB  - A multi-center open study was conducted to investigate cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) regarding to its pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical aspects in the field of obstetrics and gynecology with the participation of 31 medical institutions and the related facilities. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Peak MICs of CZON for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase (-) staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis group, Peptostreptococcus spp. isolated from obstetrical and gynecological infections with relatively high frequencies were 0.39, 0.20, 0.024, 0.024-0.05, 12.5, 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively, with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. 2. When 1 g of CZON was given through bolus injection, the maximum concentration (Cmax) of CZON in pelvic dead space exudate was 18.7 micrograms/ml at 60.9 minutes (Tmax) after the injection; Cmax's in all female genital tissues were observed at 0.6-27.9 minutes and ranged from 11.9-26.3 micrograms/g. The Cmax 8.3 micrograms/ml, in the pelvic dead space exudate was noted at 97.0 minutes after the end of the intravenous drip infusion of 1 g over 1 hour, and Cmax's in genital tissues were 14.3-30.0 micrograms/g at the end of infusion. With 1 hour drip infusion of 2 g, Cmax's in genital tissues were 35.0-53.9 micrograms/g at the end of infusion. 3. The clinical efficacy of CZON was evaluated in 206 evaluable patients with obstetric and gynecologic infections. Efficacy rates classified by types of infections were 97.1% (67/69) for intrauterine infections, 81.6% (31/38) for intrapelvic infections, 91.8% (45/49) for adnexitis, 95.2% (20/21) for infections of the external genital organs and 86.2% (25/29) for other infections. 4. Side effects were observed in 7 of the 262 patients: eruption in 6 cases, itching in 2, diarrhea in 1. Abnormal laboratory test values were noted in 9 of the 256 patients. Most of them were slight elevation of hepatic function values. CZON showed satisfactory clinical efficacy and potent antibacterial activity, hence it appears that CZON will be a very useful antibiotic for obstetric and gynecologic infections.
TI  - A multicenter comparative study of cefotetan once daily and cefoxitin thrice daily for the treatment of infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
AB  - To compare the effectiveness of cefotetan administered at 2 g once a day with cefoxitin at 1 or 2 g three times a day in the treatment of hospitalized patients with skin and superficial soft tissue infections, 194 patients from eight centers were enrolled in an open, randomized trial. Most of the 104 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 50 in the cefoxitin group were young men with community-acquired, moderate or severe cellulitis, or abscesses of the upper and lower extremities caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis and other species of bacteroides, peptococcus species, and peptostreptococcus species. The mean duration of treatment was 7.5 days for cefotetan and 7.1 days for cefoxitin. A successful clinical response was achieved in 97 percent of the cefotetan patients and in 94 percent of the cefoxitin patients. Of the 88 and 39 bacteriologically evaluable patients in the cefotetan and cefoxitin groups, respectively, a satisfactory bacteriologic response occurred in 96 percent and 87 percent of the patients. No clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory determinations were noted. The incidence of adverse reactions in the cefotetan group (17 percent) was significantly different from that for the cefoxitin group (6 percent) (p less than 0.05); however, the incidence of treatment-related reactions was not significant and the events were mild. Discontinuation of therapy was necessary only in two patients in whom allergic-type reactions developed. A once-daily regimen of cefotetan was as effective as thrice-daily cefoxitin in this study in the treatment of primarily polymicrobial, moderate, or severe infections of the skin and superficial soft tissue.
TI  - [Studies on antimicrobial concentrations of flomoxef in serum, pelvic dead space  exudate, and pelvic organs/tissues].
AB  - To women undergoing radical and total hysterectomy, flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S) in a  dose of 2 g was administered by intravenous drip infusion over 1 hour and drug concentrations in serum and pelvic dead space exudate as well as pelvic organs/tissues were determined over time. The following results were obtained: 1. Serum concentrations of FMOX after intravenous infusion showed the peak value of 92.86 +/- 17.05 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion and then gradually decreased to 29.00 +/- 10.49 micrograms/ml in 1 hour and 1.16 +/- 1.08 micrograms/ml in 6 hours. 2. Concentrations in pelvic dead space exudate, which were 6.54 +/- 3.21 micrograms/ml at the end of intravenous infusion, gradually increased to 31.28 +/- 12.69 micrograms/ml in 30 minutes, and the peak of 35.21 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml in 1 hour. Exudate concentrations gradually decreased to 11.10 +/- 6.64 micrograms/ml at 6 hours after infusion. 3. The serum concentration at the ligature of uterine artery was 103.21 +/- 51.69 micrograms/ml. Among concentrations in pelvic organ/tissues 37.17 +/- 18.20 micrograms/ml in uterine cervix was the highest, followed by 35.77 +/- 7.68 micrograms/g in portio vaginalis, 26.35 +/- 14.15 micrograms/g in tube, 21.62 +/- 12.15 micrograms/g in ovary, 20.56 +/- 9.82 micrograms/g in myometrium, and 16.45 +/- 8.10 micrograms/g in endometrium, in this order. 4. From an analysis of the two-compartment model, the maximum serum concentration was 92.81 micrograms/ml, which was very high. The time of 50% reduction of concentration in beta phase was 1.21 hours. In the pelvic dead space exudate, the maximum concentration was 32.38 micrograms/ml and the time of 50% reduction was 2.44 hours. The AUC was 147 micrograms.hr/ml in serum and 201 micrograms.hr/ml in the pelvic dead space. The shift to the pelvic dead space was 137% when AUC's were used as the basis of the comparison. 5. Clinically, FMOX was excellently effective against adnexitis caused by Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, intrauterine infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, cystitis caused by Klebsiella and Escherichia coli, vaginal stump infection caused by Streptococcus and E. coli and many other infections.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of modified radiometric blood culture medium supplemented with gelatin for detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - Although the addition of 1.2% gelatin to broth blood culture media containing sodium polyanetholesulfonate has been shown to enhance detection of certain bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis, the effect of such supplementation on the detection of other microorganisms causing bacteremia and fungemia is not known. Therefore, we studied BACTEC 6B medium with and without gelatin in 6,833 paired comparisons to examine the effects of supplementation on both the yield and the speed of detection of sepsis. More aerobic and facultative bacteria grew in the 6B than in the 6B-gelatin medium (P less than 0.001), especially staphylococci (P less than 0.01), Escherichia coli (P less than 0.01), other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P less than 0.05), and Acinetobacter spp. (P less than 0.05). When microorganisms grew in both bottles, they did so earlier in 6B than in 6B-gelatin (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the 6B medium in its present formulation is superior to 6B medium supplemented with 1.2% gelatin.
TI  - Effect of high-fiber and high-oil diets on the fecal flora of swine.
AB  - Six pairs of pigs were fed a basal diet, a high-fiber diet, and a diet high in corn oil in different sequences to minimize the carry-over effect of diet. After 2 months on each diet, a fecal specimen from each pig was cultured on nonselective medium in roll tubes. Fifty colonies were randomly selected from each fecal sample, and isolates were characterized to identify a representative cross section of the fecal flora. The bacterial composition of the fecal flora differed between basal and high-fiber diets (P = 0.002) and between high-fiber and high-oil diets (P = 0.015). However, the floras were not significantly different between the basal and the high-oil diets (P = 0.135), nor were the floras of the 12 individual pigs (each on all three diets) statistically different (P = 0.103). Only 14 of the 160 observed taxa have been detected in the human fecal flora, and only 159 of 1,871 total isolates (8.5%) were members of described species. The most common isolate was a Streptococcus species similar to that reported by Robinson et al. (I. M. Robinson, S. C. Whipp, J. A. Bucklin, and M. J. Allison, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 48:964-969, 1984), which was found in 34 of 36 samples and which represented 27.5% of all isolates. Lactobacillus, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, Bacteroides, and Peptostreptococcus species were the next most common bacteria. Escherichia coli represented 1.7% of all fecal isolates, which is somewhat higher than the 0.1 to 0.6% observed in human feces cultured similarly with prereduced anaerobically sterilized media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [Clinical studies on cefuzonam in obstetrics and gynecological infections].
AB  - To evaluate the usefulness and the safety of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) against obstetric and gynecological infections, we conducted clinical trials and obtained the results summarized as follows. 1. Thirteen patients with obstetric and gynecological infections (intrauterine infection 2 cases, adnexitis 7, 1 case each of abscess of adnexa uteri, abscess of the vaginal wall, pyelonephritis, and mammitis) were treated with CZON. The CZON was administered by intravenous injection or intravenous drip infusion, 1 g twice daily for 4 to 7 days (8 g to 14 g in total). The clinical effect was good in 12 and poor in 1. 2. Four cases, on which other antimicrobial agents were ineffective, responded well to CZON. 3. The CZON displayed excellent effects on anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis) and Gram negative rods (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae). 4. No side effects or laboratory abnormalities were observed. 5. From the above results, CZON appeared to be an effective and useful drug for obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Use of intravenous ciprofloxacin in difficult-to-treat infections.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin was administered to 54 patients who were either critically ill or in whom oral administration was not possible. The 31 males and 23 females ranged in age from 20 to 89 years (mean, 53.2 +/- 17.8 years). Patients had "difficult-to-treat" infections, i.e., respiratory infections (15), abscesses (four intraabdominal, three lung, two soft tissue, and one intrahepatic), deep soft tissue infections (10), chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (nine), upper urinary tract infection (five), malignant external otitis (two), catheter-related bacteremia (two), and infectious endocarditis (one). Thirty patients (56 percent) had serious associated medical problems. Pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38 isolates), Acinetobacter species (10 isolates), Enterobacter cloacae (eight isolates), Escherichia coli (two isolates), Proteus mirabilis (one isolate), Kingella kingae (one isolate), Bacteroides fragilis (eight isolates), and Peptostreptococcus species (five isolates). Minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.003 to 2 micrograms/ml. In 39 patients, the isolated microorganisms were multi-resistant; resistance included ceftazidime and amikacin in 32 patients. In 24 patients, ciprofloxacin was given exclusively by the intravenous route at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours; in 30 patients, treatment was completed after discontinuation of the parenteral drug with the oral preparation of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours. The duration of parenteral treatment ranged from six to 40 days (mean, 14.9 days). A successful clinical response was observed in 49 patients (91 percent), while five (9 percent) failed to show a response. Bacteriologic outcomes were as follows: eradication of pathogen in 33 patients (61.1 percent), persistence in 18 (33.3 percent), and relapse in three (5.6 percent), with development of resistance to ciprofloxacin in nine patients (16.7 percent) and superinfection in two patients (3.7 percent). Side effects included vein irritation at the site of the infusion (three patients), abnormal elevation in liver enzyme levels (two patients), reversible renal failure (one patient), and nausea (one patient). Parenteral ciprofloxacin is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective therapy for the critically ill patient, and can be replaced with the oral form when clinically appropriate.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin in the treatment of soft tissue pelvic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin were evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. There were 33 cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). The most frequent isolates were Bacteroides sp., 54; Bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented Bacteroides, 12; Bacteroides disiens, 11; Fusobacterium, 13; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; Gardnerella vaginalis, 29; Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and Escherichia coli, five. Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. One treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. The cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. The third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.
TI  - [Bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  - During six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. All the specimens investigated were taken from patients of surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. In total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like Staphylococus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. Out of the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by Enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive Proteus species. The over all isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. In the last time Pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional Streptococcus faecium and Corynebacterium JK. Dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides sp., Peptococcus- and Peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in the infectious diseases. The epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. From there preventive measures must be induced.
TI  - The significance of clostridial isolates in intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  - In order to evaluate the significance of clostridial species in intra-abdominal infections, the bacteriology records of three hospitals were reviewed during a period of five years. Included in this report were 41 patients from whom clostridial species were recovered from specimens of free peritoneal fluid, abscess cavities or bile. Seven patients died for a mortality rate of 17.1 per cent. Most patients had polymicrobial infections of which clostridial organisms were one of the several anaerobes isolated. Clostridium perfringens was the single most frequently noted species, identified in 23 of the patients, but it was not associated with a different mortality rate than was observed for the other clostridial species. Clostridial bacteremia was uncommon and demonstrated in only one patient. The mean age of the patients was 56.4 years; 56.2 for males and 56.8 for females. Neither age nor sex of the patient influenced the likelihood of survival. The source of the clostridial isolates--bile, abscess cavity or free peritoneal fluid--had no effect upon the outcome. Several underlying conditions were responsible for the intraperitoneal clostridial organisms identified in this series. Only mesenteric infarction proved significantly predictive of a fatal result. Antibiotic coverage specifically directed against clostridia did not influence survival.

TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin versus metronidazole/gentamicin in the treatment of severe pelvic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of sulbactam/ampicillin versus metronidazole/gentamicin were compared in 39 patients with severe pelvic infections. 30 patients had severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, 3 tubo-ovarian abscesses, 4 endomyometritis, and 2 posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the sites of infection yielded 259 micro-organisms from 38 patients; an average of 6.8 bacteria per infection (3.9 anaerobes and 2.9 aerobes). The most frequent isolates were Bacteroides spp. (21), B. bivius (13), B. disiens (8), Fusobacterium spp. (9), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (15), P. asaccharolyticus (8), anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (17), Gardnerella vaginalis (24), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (14), alpha-haemolytic streptococci (6) and Escherichia coli (3). Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 of 19 treated with metronidazole/gentamicin. The sulbactam/ampicillin failure was a patient with pelvic inflammatory disease with a positive Chlamydia trachomatis culture who required antichlamydial therapy. The metronidazole/gentamicin failures included a patient with a tubo-ovarian abscess requiring surgical drainage and 2 patients with pelvic inflammatory disease requiring antichlamydial treatment. No adverse haematological, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.
TI  - Moxalactam versus clindamycin plus tobramycin in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy of moxalactam versus clindamycin/tobramycin was evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Sixty patients were treated: 30 with moxalactam and 30 with clindamycin/tobramycin. There were 15 cases of tuboovarian abscess, 36 cases of severe pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, eight cases of endomyometritis, and one wound abscess. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the sites of infection yielded 441 microorganisms from 53 patients; an average of 8.3 bacteria per infection (4.5 anaerobes and 3.8 aerobes). The infections tended to be mixed aerobic-anaerobic with anaerobes isolated in 90% of cases. The most frequently isolated possible pathogens were Bacteroides sp. (37), Bacteroides bivius (23), Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (12), Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (29), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (19), unidentified anaerobic gram-positive cocci (18), Escherichia coli (17), nonhemolytic streptococci (16), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (13), and Gardnerella vaginalis (38). Clinical cure was noted in 29 of 30 moxalactam-treated and 29 of 30 clindamycin/tobramycin-treated patients. Moxalactam was effective in five of six cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 22 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, the one case of endomyometritis and the one wound abscess. Clindamycin/tobramycin was effective in eight of nine cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 14 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, and all seven cases of endomyometritis. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  - Worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of 72 patients with a variety of obstetric and gynecologic infections is reviewed. Clinical cure or improvement occurred in 97% of 72 assessable patients. The most common etiologic pathogens were Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococci, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides species, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus. Of the recovered pathogens, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem/cilastatin. Bacteriologic response was also excellent and none of the pathogens acquired resistance to imipenem. Most patients tolerated intravenous administration of imipenem/cilastatin well to moderately well.
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK0787/MK0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. Clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. Efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. Major pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. Eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. No major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. The results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Effect of aspoxicillin on anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Aspoxicillin (ASPC), a semisynthetic penicillin has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Its in vitro antibacterial activity was less than those of cefoxitin against Peptostreptococcus and Veillonella, but was significantly high against Bacteroides fragilis, one of the most clinically important anaerobe. The therapeutic and/or protective effect of ASPC in experimental subcutaneous abscess or experimental intraabdominal mixed infection due to beta-lactamase producing B. fragilis and non-producing Escherichia coli were much stronger than those of ticarcillin. In order to account the superiority of ASPC in vivo, the effects of ASPC and other beta-lactams on B. fragilis were compared and the results were analyzed in relation to their in vitro bactericidal activities, stability against the beta-lactamase, binding properties with penicillin-binding proteins and pharmacokinetic properties. Interestingly, administration of ASPC did not increase the bacterial counts of Clostridium difficile in caecal contents, but piperacillin, ticalcillin, carbenicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime increased the counts.
TI  - In vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on Clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of sulphasalazine (SASP), azodisal sodium (ADS), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. Sulphapyridine (SP) had a mild to moderate effect on Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. SASP also had a growth-inhibitory effect on Strep. faecalis. The other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. SASP, SP, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. Of special interest was the inhibitory effect on Clostridium difficile strains. In recent years the possibility that overgrowth of Cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. Some studies suggested that SASP treatment could predispose to Cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found SASP more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. Our findings support the theory that SASP treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of Cl. difficile superinfection.
TI  - [Bacteriological study of cefminox in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new cephem antibiotic, was determined of its antibacterial activity against 304 clinical isolates with following results. CMNX was inferior to CEZ or CMZ in the activity against 78 isolates of Staphylococcus sp., but it was superior to these antibiotics in the activity against 104 isolates of E. coli. Against 53 isolates of Bacteroides sp., CMNX showed higher activity than CEZ or CMZ. In the activity against 69 isolates of Peptococcus sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp., CMNX was almost equal to CEZ.
TI  - Mutagenic activation of biliary metabolites of 1-nitropyrene by intestinal microflora.
AB  - To investigate the modifying role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens in vivo, we subjected bile from Fischer rats treated per os with chemical carcinogens and related compounds to a mutagenicity assay in the presence and absence of a cell-free extract from human feces. A mixture of the bile sample and potassium phosphate buffer was incubated in the presence or absence of human cell-free fecal extract and then further incubated with a bacterial suspension of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 or TA100. Bile from rats treated with 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) produced about 2700 and 400 revertants per plate in strain TA98 in the presence and absence of the fecal extract, respectively. There was a drug dose- and bile volume-related response. Treatment of 1-NP-bile with beta-glucuronidase, but not aryl sulfatase, enhanced its mutagenicity. Cell-free extracts of some strains of intestinal bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 12044, B. vulgatus ATCC 8482, B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC 12290, Bacteroides sp. strain 524, Eubacterium eligens VPI C15-48, Peptostreptococcus sp. strain 204 and Escherichia coli A-5-18) also enhanced the mutagenicity of 1-NP-bile. These bacterial cell-free extracts hydrolyzed the synthetic beta-D-glucuronides of phenolphthalein and/or p-nitrophenol. These data indicate that the glucuronide(s) of 1-NP-metabolite(s) secreted into bile can be hydrolyzed in the intestine by bacterial beta-glucuronidases to potent mutagenic aglycone(s).
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - Pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (AGPC) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. Abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. The relationships among seven AGPC strains, eight aerobes, and two Bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. A total of 70 different combinations were tested. As judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or AGPC were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35 combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. The AGPC most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were Peptococcus magnus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the AGPC.
TI  - Production of menaquinones by intestinal anaerobes.
AB  - Ninety intestinal organisms (71 isolates from fecal samples of neutropenic patients with cancer or from various sites in patients with intraabdominal infections and 19 control strains) were examined by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography for their ability to produce menaquinones in vitro. Menaquinones were found in all of 24 organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Two other Bacteroides species, Bacteroides disiens and Bacteroides bivius, also produced menaquinones. A single isolate of Bacteroides species lacked menaquinones. These constituents were found in all of five strains of Escherichia coli, all of four strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, five of eight strains of Propionibacterium species, two of five strains of Eubacterium species, and the one strain each of Arachnia propionica and Veillonella parvula tested. No menaquinones were detected in organisms of the genera Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Peptococcus, or Peptostreptococcus. These findings suggest that E. coli, Bacteroides species, and some gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacilli produce menaquinones that may be a source of vitamin K in patients who are deprived of exogenous vitamin K1.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of tinidazole on anaerobic infections in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - The bacteriological and clinical effect of tinidazole (TDZ) was evaluated in 16 cases of intrauterine, intrapelvic and vulvar infection caused by anaerobic organisms and the following results were obtained. Anaerobes were detected in 16 cases, including 1 case with anaerobes alone and 15 cases with mixed anaerobes and aerobes. Eight different species and 24 strains were detected. A single species was isolated from 9 cases, 2 species from 6 cases and 3 species from 1 case. The main species detected were Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. of which 9 strains (37.5%) each were isolated. Escherichia coli and B. fragilis was the most frequently occurring combination. The peak MIC values of TDZ were 0.78 micrograms/ml for B. fragilis and 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus spp. Most other organisms were also sensitive to TDZ. The bacteriological response of the anaerobic infections to TDZ was 87.5% and overall clinical efficacy was 87.5%. Few side effects were observed.
TI  - [Cefotiam passage into the maxillary sinus tissues].
AB  - Clinical study was made on cefotiam (CTM) and the following results were obtained. Tissue concentrations of CTM were determined 1 hour after intravenous injection (CTM 1 g) in chronic sinusitis and maxillary cyst. Concentrations of CTM were 16.53 micrograms/g, 13.26 micrograms/g in mucosa of the maxillary sinus, maxillary cyst, respectively. Antibacterial activity of CTM was measured on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aerococcus, Acidaminococcus fermentans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; that were isolated from pus of maxillary sinus. The highest MIC on them was 3.13 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Tubo-ovarian abscess: contemporary approach to management.
AB  - Two hundred and thirty-two patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOAs) were evaluated. Ruptured TOAs were documented in seven (3%) of the patients. One hundred and seventy-five patients with TOAs were treated with antibiotics alone; for 15 of these patients, TOAs were confirmed by laparoscopy. The remaining 57 patients required surgical intervention: drainage (five patients), unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (19) and total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (33). A unilateral TOA was present in 163 patients (70%). Seventy-six patients with TOAs used intrauterine contraceptive devices, and in this group, 54 (71%) patients had unilateral TOAs. The most common microorganisms that were recovered from these TOAs were Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, and aerobic streptococci. Sixty-eight percent of the patients treated with an antimicrobial regimen that included clindamycin had a decrease in the size of the TOA, while only 36.5% of those receiving antimicrobial regimens without clindamycin had a decrease in the size of the TOA (P less than .01). Long-term follow-up information (two to 10 years) was available for 58 of the patients treated with antibiotics alone. Eighteen (31%) required subsequent surgery; 12 had persistent TOAs; and six, chronic salpingo-oophoritis. Intrauterine pregnancy was documented in eight (13.8%) patients. Of the 19 patients treated with unilateral adnexectomy, two ultimately required hysterectomy and contralateral adnexectomy, while three patients in this group subsequently became pregnant (one ectopic and two intrauterine).
TI  - Susceptibility of brain to aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal organisms.
AB  - The utility of an experimental animal model is dependent on its ability to simulate the actual clinical situation. With a stereotaxic injection procedure, the susceptibility of rat brain to the spectrum of organisms commonly associated with human brain abscess was determined. Two strains of Escherichia coli were more infective than Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Even between the E. coli strains it was possible to document significant differences in degree of infectivity. The E. coli strain with the K-1 capsular polysaccharide was significantly more infective than the E. coli strain without the capsular polysaccharide. The brain was also susceptible to Candida albicans, but at a level higher than any of the aerobic bacteria examined. Brain infection could not be created when microaerophilic or obligately anaerobic organisms alone were injected.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria associated with osteomyelitis in domestic animals.
AB  - Specimens of bony tissue or adjacent soft tissue from 19 animals with osteomyelitis were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Fourteen specimens (74%) yielded anaerobic bacteria in pure culture or mixed with aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria. The most predominant genus encountered was an obligate anaerobe, Bacteroides. The most frequently isolated Bacteroides species was Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, which was isolated 5 times. The most frequently isolated anaerobe was Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which was isolated 6 times. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria, with 7 and 6 isolates, respectively.
TI  - Cecal microflora of turkeys fed low or high fiber diets: enumeration, identification, and determination of cellulolytic activity.
AB  - Examination of cecal contents or bacterial cultures thereof from turkeys fed either a high fiber (HF) or low fiber (LF) ration indicated that direct microscopic counts of microbes were significantly higher in HF-fed than in LF-fed birds. There was no significant difference in mean colony counts between the two groups of turkeys. In both LF and HF-fed birds, 77% of the microbes were Gram-positive rods, 14% Gram-negative rods, and 9% Gram-positive cocci. The predominant microorganism was Eubacterium, but Lactobacillus, Peptostreptococcus, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium, and Bacteriodes were also isolated. Percentages of Peptostreptococcus were significantly greater in HF-fed turkeys and of E. coli were significantly greater in LF-fed turkeys. Yeasts were routinely found in both LF and HF-fed birds, but protozoa were not isolated. Turkeys fed the HF diet harbored significantly higher numbers of facultative microorganisms than did LF-fed birds. In pure cultures from turkeys preconditioned to a HF diet, there was a nonsignificant trend toward greater cellulolysis than in pure cultures from LF-fed turkeys. In contrast, cellulolysis by mixed cultures from HF-fed birds was significantly greater than that in mixed cultures from LF-fed turkeys.
TI  - Isolation of anaerobic organisms from kidney in serious renal infections.
AB  - We have studied 45 patients who underwent nephrectomy owing to unilateral renal sepsis for anaerobic and aerobic bacterial growth in the urine and kidney. Anaerobic organisms were recovered from 11 patients: 10 had positive kidney cultures, and only 1 had positive kidney and urine cultures. There was a distinct relationship between anaerobic infection of the kidney and urinary tract obstruction; 44 per cent of the obstructed kidneys yielded anaerobic organisms versus only 11 per cent of the unobstructed kidneys. Bacteroides fragilis was the anaerobic organism most often cultured. It is suggested that cultures for anaerobic organisms be performed together with aerobic cultures in patients with symptomatic upper urinary tract infections associated with urinary obstruction. In patients in whom anaerobic infection is suspected, in spite of negative anaerobic cultures, antibiotic treatment for anaerobes should be added to the existing therapeutic measures.
TI  - Anaerobes: a new aetiology in cavitary pneumoconiosis.
AB  - The role of mycobacteria in the cavitation of large pneumoconiotic masses is well established. In other cases softness is attributed to an ischaemic or aseptic necrosis. Five cases are described in which cavitation of the pulmonary masses was caused by anaerobic bacteria, confirmed by the growth of such bacterial in cultures after transtracheal or transpleural puncture. Repeated cultures for mycobacteria gave negative results. Two cases were acute, having serious complications such as bronchopleural fistula, empyema, and serious respiratory insufficiency. The role of anaerobes in cavitary pneumoconiosis has not been recognised previously, probably because of the special conditions required to culture these bacteria and the infrequent use of transtracheal puncture in the diagnosis of this entity. The prevalence of anaerobes as agents capable of cavitating pneumoconiotic masses remains to be established.
TI  - Response of mice to transtracheal pulmonary inoculation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The transtracheal inoculation of a mixture of anaerobic bacteria, with or without hydrochloric acid, into the lungs of mice caused nonlethal pneumonia and abscesses in a minority of challenged animals. All animals cleared organisms and recovered by 30 days. Secondary infection with Escherichia coli was common but did not affect the response to challenge with the anaerobes.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of piperacillin in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - In vitro activity of piperacillin (PIPC) against 150 recent clinical isolates from obstetric and gynecologic infections was performed in comparison with sulbenicillin (SBPC), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefsulodin (CFS). At 6.25 micrograms/ml PIPC inhibited 93% of S. epidermidis, 86% of S. faecalis, 67% of E. coli and 80% of Klebsiella. At 0.2 microgram/ml PIPC inhibited 100% of Peptococcus, 73% of Peptostreptococcus and 100% of B. melaninogenicus group. At 3.13 micrograms/ml PIPC inhibited 71% of B. fragilis 9 strains, B. distasonis 3 strains, B. thetaiotaomicron 1 strain, B. ovatus 1 strain. PIPC was constantly more active than SBPC, and it was especially more active against S. faecalis, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and B. melaninogenicus group than other antibiotics. These findings show that PIPC is a broad spectrum penicillin against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms including anaerobic organisms. PIPC was administered to 5 patients intravenously and all cases proved to be effective. No side effects and no abnormalities in laboratory findings were observed. These results suggest that PIPC may be highly effective in the treatment of bacterial infections.
TI  - Vaginal organisms in prepubertal children with and without vulvovaginitis. A vaginoscopic study.
AB  - In a prospective clinical and microbiological study covering 67 prepubertal children the vaginal flora of 31 asymptomatic children was compared to 36 children suffering from abnormal vaginal discharge and/or vulvovaginitis. Vaginoscopy was employed to obtain bacteriological specimens without contamination. Swabs were inoculated into prereduced transportmedia (PORT A CUL, BBL) and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. The most prevalent aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis. Enterococci and Escherichia coli; the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella parvula, Eubacteria, Propionibacterium and Bacteroides species. A similar microbiological pattern was found in both groups, although anaerobes, like Peptococci and Peptostreptococci and Bacteroides species, as well as yeasts, like Candida albicans were significantly more frequent in the group with signs and symptoms. Lactobacilli were less common in this group.
TI  - [Anaerobic microflora of praepubertal children (author's transl)].
AB  - Bacteriologic cultures of the vagina and the cervix of 38 praepubertal children,  aged 3 months to 16 years (average age 9 years) from the outpatient department for infants and juveniles of the 1st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Vienna were obtained vaginascopically using anaerobic transportmedia (Port a Cul) and were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. An average of 5.3 species was also isolated per child (2.9 aerobic and 2.5 anaerobic species). The commonest anaerobes were Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Bact. melaninogenicus, Proprionibacterium and Veillonella parvula, the prevalent aerobes, were Enterococci, E coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that anaerobic bacteria amount a significant component of the flora of the lower genital-tract of healthy children, as well as of infants with vaginal discharge.
TI  - [Comparison of antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime with other cephalosporins against clinically isolated bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - We examined the antibacterial activity of MX in comparison with those of other CEPs, using aerobic Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, 870 strains in total, all isolated from clinical specimens, in 1979 and 1980. Against Streptococcus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM and CTM. Against H. influenzae, CMX also showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMX, CXM, CTM and CEZ. ABPC-and PIPC-resistant strains were sensitive to CMX. CTX, CPZ and CZX also showed antibacterial activities equivalent to that of CMX. Against enteric bacteria, E. coli, Klebsiella, E. cloacae, Serratia, C. freundii and Proteus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM, CTM and CEZ. Especially, against E. coli, Klebsiella, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity. As to non-fermentation bacteria, CMX's antibacterial activity was relatively weak except P. putrefaciens, Alcaligenes and Comamonas. However, it was superior than that of CEZ. In comparison with other CEPs, the strength of CMX varied according to the kinds of bacteria. As to anaerobic bacteria, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, C. perfringens, Veillonella and Fusobacterium. However, its antibacterial activity against Bacteroides was similar to those of other CEPs.
TI  - Lactobacilli do not cause frequency and dysuria syndrome.
AB  - Mid-stream specimens (MSU) of urine were collected from 142 healthy women (pregnant and non-pregnant) and cultured for lactobacilli and other fastidious bacteria. The latter either require CO2 or are obligate anaerobes. Lactobacilli were present in counts of 10(4)/ml or more in 34.8% of the women, and in counts of 10(5)/ml or more in 20.2%. Besides lactobacilli, which were the bacteria most frequently isolated, anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptococci and peptostreptococci) were often found. This flora is typical of that of the lower vagina, and none of these women had either symptoms of urinary infection of pyuria. Therefore, the bacteria isolated were commensals or contaminants. Cultures of MSUs taken from 26 women with symptoms of dysuria and/or frequency, but without significant numbers of conventional pathogens such as Escherichia coli, contained commensals and contaminants of the same variety and in similar numbers. Urine samples from 50% of these patients contained at least 10(4) lactobacilli/ml and 27% had 10(5) or more/ml. Lactobacilli were absent from the suprapubic urine specimens cultured from a further 44 women. There was no significant difference between the isolation rate of lactobacilli in urine cultures from healthy women and the rate in women with dysuria and frequency.
TI  - Colonic bacteria: a source of gamma-aminobutyric acid in blood.
AB  
TI  - Premature labor. II. Bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  - Human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase A2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. The striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase A2 activity. Activity was found in Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus A and B, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pneumococcus, Lactobacillus, and Mycoplasma hominis. Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and S viridans had the highest activities. The specific activities of phospholipase A2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase A2 of the amnion and chorion. We postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase A2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.
TI  - Bacterial interference between Clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  - Clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. It is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by C. difficile. The inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against C. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. Strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of C. difficile, with Lactobacillus organisms and group D enterococci displaying the most antagonistic activity. C. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. All eight strains of C. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera Bacteroides, Peptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Puerperal sepsis in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Because puerperal sepsis is the second most common cause of maternal death in Papua New Guinea some aspects of its aetiology and prevention have been investigated. 91% of 125 women with puerperal fever were found to have post-partum uterine infection. The anaerobes Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus singly or together, were the commonest causes, while Streptococcus pyogenes was the predominant aerobic species. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns were established, and chloramphenicol was found to be the most active agent against anaerobic and most aerobic strains. Endocervical cultures obtained from 103 ante-partum and 50 afebrile post-partum women demonstrated all the species associated with post-partum genital infection in this study. An analysis of the records of all patients was made to determine the redisposing factors associated with puerperal fever; only operative delivery was found to be significant, especially when it followed prolonged labour. Metronidazole given to 72 women before induction of labour was associated with puerperal fever in 4%, compared with 21% in matched controls.
TI  - Microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of Iran.
AB  - A total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. A total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. Microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus and Pasteurella, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Eubacterium tortuosum were isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. Two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. It was determined that 11 isolates of Corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of P multocida, and 1 of C pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. Two of the C pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. As determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. In nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with C pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. Postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly Przhevalskiana silenus at the site of infection.
TI  - Do anaerobes cause urinary tract infection?
AB  
TI  - The presence of antibody-coated anaerobic bacteria in asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy.
AB  - Quantitative anaerobic culture of urine samples obtained from 593 pregnant women  by suprapubic bladder aspiration was performed to establish the involvement of anaerobic bacteria in asymptomatic urinary tract infections. The fluorescent antibody (FA) test was applied to the sediments of bladder aspirates to determine the site of infection. Anaerobic bacteriuria (greater than or equal to 10(4) microorganisms/ml of urine) was found in 34 patients, of whom five were FA-positive. These anaerobes were identified as Lactobacillus minutus, Veillonella parvula (two patients). Clostridium putrefaciens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aerobic bacteriuria (greater than 10(4) microorganisms/ml of urine) was detected in 27 patients, of whom 13 were FA-positive. In 10 women with mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteriuria, no FA-positive bacteria were found. The finding of FA-positive anaerobes may indicate that these organisms are involved in silent renal infection.
TI  - The prevalence of anaerobic bacteria in suprapubic bladder aspirates obtained from pregnant women.
AB  - The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria due to aerobic, facultative anaerobic and strictly anaerobic bacteria during pregnancy was determined in 185 patients admitted for complications of pregnancy, using suprapubic bladder aspiration. Anaerobic bacterial counts of 103 per ml urine or higher were detected in 6.4 per cent of the specimens. The incidence of anaerobic bacteriuria seems comparable to that of bacteriuria due to aerobic and facultative anaerobic micro organisms. In our group of patients the incidence of the latter was 5.4%. The presence of anaerobic bacteria was not confined to the occurrence of a particular species. Peptostreptococcus species, Veillonella species, Bacteroides species, Eubacterium species, Clostridium species and Bifidobacterium species were isolated from specimens in concentrations of more than 103 per ml. Consequences of asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy are totally uncertain. Further investigation is necessary to obtain insight into the effect of bacteriuria due to anaerobes upon the outcome of pregnancy.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Fecal bacteria in South African rural blacks and other population groups.
AB  - Quantitative studies were performed on fecal flora of three population groups consuming different diets. Twenty rural black South Africans and 22 Japanese, representing groups at low risk for carcinoma of the colon, were compared with 41 North Americans from a high-risk population. Specimens taken immediately after defecation were mixed and processed under anaerobic conditions. After the initial incubation, roll tubes were shipped to the United States for final identification. Bacterioides and bifidobacteria were present in lower numbers in South African subjects, as were Bacteroides uniformis (thought to be increased by conditions of fear and anger stress), compared with the other two groups. The number of B. vulgatus and B. distasonis and the "Peptostreptococcus productus species complex," showed a positive correlation with the risk of colon cancer, while an inverse relationship was found with Eubacterium aerofaciens II, B. fragilis and Escherichia coli. The percentage of fecal isolates stimulated by bile was slightly higher in populations with a high fat intake and a high risk of cancer of the colon.
TI  - Perirectal abscess in childhood. A review of 29 cases.
AB  - A total of 29 cases of perirectal abscess at Milwaukee Children's Hospital between 1965 and 1975 were retrospectively reviewed. One fourth of these children had a serious underlying chronic disease. Staphylococcus aureaus was the organism that grew most frequently from pus obtained from the abscesses, accounting for 52% of the isolates. Therapy included incision and drainage alone and incision and drainage plus parenteral and/or oral antibiotic treatment. One patient, a child with leukemia, died of this infection. Complications, primarily fistulain-ano or recurrent abscess, occurred in 42% of the survivors.
TI  - Bacteriology and therapy of lung abscess in children.
AB  - The bacteriology and clinical findings of ten pediatric patients with lung abscess are presented. Bacteriologic data were based on percutaneous transtracheal aspiration obtained before initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Anaerobic bacteria were present in all ten patients; in nine they were mixed with aerobic bacteria. The most frequent isolates were Peptostreptococcus (8), Peptococcus (5), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (6), and Bacteroides fragilis (3). The aerobic isolates most frequently recovered were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (5), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (4), and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). Virtually all abscesses were located in dependent pulmonary segments. Antimicrobial therapy was guided by the bacteriologic findings and was successful in all instances.
TI  - [First steps in the bacterial colonization of the digestive tract of neonates (author's transl)].
AB  - Meconium samples obtained from 14 children aged 18 to 51 h were subjected to a quantitative differential analysis. The meconium of one of the children (47 h old) was sterile; in those of the 11 infants aged less than 47 h the dominant flora was composed of either enterobacteria, mainly Escherichia coli sensitive to usual antibiotics, or of streptococci. The genus Acinetobacter constituted the dominant flora in one case only. Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Clostridium (C. perfringens), Bacteroides, Peptococcus, when present in the meconium, represented a very small proportion of the total flora. In the two children aged 48 h and more, the flora was more complex and Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium and Staphylococcus were associated to streptococci and enterobacteria. A very small number of lactobacilli was found in one child only. No yeasts were detected. The sequence of establishment of the various bacteria was studied in a child (OG) by an analysis of 8 samples obtained between 0 and 74 h after its birth. E. coli and Streptococcus became established 24 h after parturition, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides the 2nd and 3rd day, respectively. Lactobacillus and Peptococcus were only present in very low number in the first 2 meconium samples and did not become established in the child, although they were present in a rather large number in the vaginal and faecal samples from the mother. In addition, use of axenic mice inoculated with the 3rd meconium from the infant OG revealed the existence of certain genera of bacteria probably of faecal origin which had not been detected by the direct analysis of the meconium. These genera did not become established in the child. The hypothesis according to which the meconium chooses among the fortuitous contaminations before true colonization of the digestive tract is established, is discussed. It was also observed that the evolution of the ratio between the number of E. coli and Proteus morganii in the successive samples obtained from OG was very different from that observed in the mice inoculated with these samples.
TI  - [Bacteriological aspects of trichomonal vaginitis (author's transl)].
AB  - An analysis was made of the vaginal flora of 25 gynaecological patients with acute trichomomal vaginitis, with the view to elucidating the bacteriological situation. Eighty-four isolates, an average of 3.4 per patient, were taken and included a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. - Obligate anaerobic species, such as bacteriodes and peptostreptococci, with susceptibility to metronidazole were among the predominant pathogens. - The differentiated susceptibility of the most common bacteria to antibiotics may yield information useful to therapy in the case of aggravated infection.
TI  - Effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  - An anaerobic transport system (ATS) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. Inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ATS environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. Bacteria in a three-part mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of B. fragilis, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for B. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. Changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. Bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ATS. These data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ATS would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
TI  - Ticarcillin disodium in anaerobic infections.
AB  - Twenty-five patients were treated with ticarcillin disodium, 18 of whom had anaerobic infections that included pleuropulmonary infections (seven), mandibular osteomyelitis (four), perirectal abscess (two), sepsis, primary site unknown (one), liver abscess (one), pelvic abscess (one), decubitus ulcer (one), and synergistic gangrene (one). Seven had no anaerobic infections. Three had anaerobic septicemia. Culture results included anaerobes: peptococci (ten), peptostreptococci (ten), Bacteroides fragilis (six), Bacteroides not fragilis (ten), eubacteria (three), fusobacteria (two), Clostridium (one), Veillonella (one), and acidaminococcus (one); aerobes: Proteus (three), Klebsiella (two), Escherichia coli (two), and streptococci (two). Six patients with mixed aerobic infections initially received gentamicin sulfate in addition. The serum levels were 110 +/- 20 microgram/ml one hour after intravenous infusion of 5 g of ticarcillin disodium. All anaerobic isolates were susceptible at less than or equal to 100 microgram/ml and 85% by less than or equal to 25 microgram/ml of ticarcillin. Sixteen patients responded well to ticarcillin and two failed to respond. Our study suggests that ticarcillin is useful in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of amniotic fluid.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of amniotic fluid (AF) obtained during the first (AF1) and second (AF2) trimesters was compared with the third (AF3) against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis ss. fragilis (6 strains), Eubacterium lentum (3 strains), and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (4 strains). Escherichia coli (5 strains) served as a positive control. AF1 supported the growth of all 4 anaerobes (except B fragilis for 4 hours) for the entire 24-hour period tested. AF2 supported the growth of E coli and B fragilis for 24 hours but temporarily inhibited P anaerobius and E lentum. In contrast, AF3 inhibited all bacteria tested for 8 hours or more. It is concluded that AF1 is the least inhibitory, AF3 the most, and AF2 intermediate for the organisms tested. Lack of antimicrobial effect of AF on anaerobic bacteria may be one explanation for the higher incidence of anaerobic infections during absortion than during the prenatal period.
TI  - Clindamycin-induced enterocolitis in hamsters.
AB  - A lethal enterocolitis was induced in hamsters by oral or parenteral administration of clindamycin in amounts comparable to those used in treatment of humans. The intestinal lesions were characterized histologically as an acute inflammatory reaction with pseudomembrane formation and resembled the lesions seen in humans with antibiotic-induced colitis. Results of quantitative stool cultures showed the numbers of Peptostreptococcus and Corynebacterium decreased in animals with colitis after challenge with 100 mg of clindamycin/kg, while numbers of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and clindamycin-resistant Clostridium sordellii and Clostridium difficile increased. Bacteria were not seen within the intestinal lesions. Viruses were not isolated from hamsters with colitis. Although the pathogenesis of this syndrome is not completely established, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the disease is caused by clostridial toxins and that the production of these toxins by organisms within the intestines is enhanced by the effects of clindamycin upon the bowel flora.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis in postpartum patients. A report of four cases.
AB  - Necrotizing fascitis is a rare but rapidly progressive soft tissue infection not  previously reported in an obstetric patient. Since cure is dependent on rapid recognition and early surgical intervention, 4 cases are reported herein, the bacteriology discussed, and the literature reviewed.
TI  - Bacteriological findings in cultures of clinical material from Bartholin's abscess.
AB  - Purulent exudate from 28 cases of Bartholin's abscess were examined for aerobic,  anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria. Three cases gave no bacterial growth, five cases grew facultative bacteria only, and a further three grew a mixture of facultative and anaerobic bacteria. One case gave a pure growth of a microaerophilic streptococcus. Anaerobic bacteria were the only isolates in 16 cases and Bacteroides species were the most common organisms isolated; they were present as 62.5% of the total anaerobes cultured and accounted for 45.4% of the total bacteria cultured. Escherichia coli was the most common of the facultative organisms, accounting for 18% of the total bacteria. Most infections seemed to be caused by a single organism, anaerobic types predominating.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in biliary disease in elderly patients.
AB  - Gallbladder bile from 52 elderly subjects who had undergone biliary tract surgery was examined for the presence of bacteria. Twelve patients had sterile bile, 18 specimens of bile yielded anaerobes as well as aerobes, and 22 yielded aerobic bacteria only. Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated organism (30 strains). Bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently encountered anaerobic bacterium and was found in 15 patients. The Klebsiella-Enterobacter group was the second most commonly isolated group and B. fragilis was third. Clostridium perfringens was recovered in 10 specimens of bile. Anaerobic bacteria were recovered more frequently in patients with ductal obstruction. The relatively frequent isolation of anaerobes, especially of B. fragilis, in this study may be related to the anaerobic techniques used, to the age of the patients, and to the high incidence of pigment stones among the subjects.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - A double-blind comparison of clindamycin with penicillin plus chloramphenicol in  treatment of septic abortion.
AB  - The responses to therapy with either clindamycin alone or penicillin plus chloramphenicol in 77 patients with septic abortions were compared in a randomized, double-blind study. Although fever index and duration of hospitalization were similar for both groups of patients, significantly more patients in the group that received clindamycin developed major complications (P less than 0.05). This is believed to result from clindamycin's lack of activity against aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Aggressive management that included early uterine evacuation and broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was the key to reduced morbidity and mortality rates in treatment of septic abortion. For patients treated with clindamycin, early uterine evacuation appeared more important than antibiotic therapy (P less than 0.005). Bacteremia was documented in a total of 29 patients (38%). Bacteremia was polymicrobial in eight patients (28%) and involved anaerobes exclusively in 18 (62%), aerobes exclusively in nine (31%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in two (7%). The organisms most frequently isolated were Bacteroides (other than Bacteroides fragilis), Peptostreptococcus, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of amniotic fluid against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Amniotic fluid samples were obtained at term and tested for their antimicrobial effect on anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus (Ps.) anaerobius, Peptococcus (Pc.) prevotii, Bacteroides (B.) fragilis, and B. coagulans with facultative Escherichia (E.) coli serving as control. Amniotic fluid had only temporary bacteriostatic effect on Pc. prevotii and B. fragilis for 8 to 16 hours. This effect lasted for only 8 hours on Ps. anaerobius. On the contrary, the bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was well sustained on E. coli and B. coagulans, lasting for the entire test periods of 20 and 32 hours, respectively. At the end of the time intervals mentioned, Ps. anaerobius, Pc. prevotii, and B. fragilis exhibited logarithmic growth, confirming the earlier reports that it is not nutritionally deficient. Amniotic fluid exhibited temporary bacteriostatic effect on Ps. anaerobius, P. prevotii, and B. fragilis, but this effect was well sustained against B. coagulans.
TI  - Medium-dependent inhibition of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius by sodium polyanetholsulfonate in blood culture media.
AB  - Of 13 species of anaerobic cocci, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was the only species tested that was sensitive to 0.1% sodium polyanetholsulfonate (SPS). However, the sensitivity of P. anaerobius to SPS varied according to the media in which the cultures were grown. In supplemented peptone (B-D) and brain heart infusion media, most strain of P. anaerobius were not inhibited by SPS. Gelatin and proteose peptone were the medium components which were protective. The minimal inhibitory concentration of SPS for P. anaerobius was approximately 60-fold higher in media. However, the concentration of SPS required to neutralize the bactericidal properties of human serum was only four fold higher in media containing geltain. In a commerical medium containing SPS (0.03%) and gelatin (1.2%), SPS-sensitive strains of P. anaerobius were not inhibited by SPS, and the bactericdal action of human blood on Escherichia coli C and Serratia marcescens SM 29 was eliminated.
TI  - Evaluation of amniotic fluid for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Studies of 117 pregnant women, 83 at term, were instituted to determine the bacteriologic state of amniotic fluid, utilizing both standard aerobic and anaerobic technics. A high association of postpartum infection was found in women who had long periods of premature reptured membranes and many vaginal examinations. Significant organisms including anaerobes, were isolated in many of these instances. Based on the findings of these studies, it is recommended that amniocentesis for aerobic and anaerobic cultures be done when membranes have been ruptured for 8 hours or more, and when the patient has had seven or more vaginal examinations during the course of labor.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
TI  - The reduction of N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  - The role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of N-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. This reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. These include cultures of Clostridium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus productus I, and Bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. In contrast, cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. The reduction of N-OH-AABP is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. On a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing N-OH-AABP than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. The cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing N-OH-AABP than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. The products of the metabolism of N-OH-AABP have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. Glucuronide conjugates of N-OH-AABP are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. These results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing N-OH-AABP, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.
TI  - Evaluation of bacteriological transport systems.
AB  - Seven commercially manufactured bacteriological transport systems, including Culturette, Trans-Cul (with Stuart and Amies), Handiswab, Securline (with Amies and Amies without charcoal) and Culture Caddy, were evaluated to determine whether these systems were capable of maintaining the viability and constant numbers of mixtures of hardy, fastidious and anaerobic organisms over 72 hours at 25C and 4C. The results of the study indicated that if specimens are maintained in transport systems at 25C they should be cultured at four hours to minimize loss of viability and to assure accurate quantitation. No one transport system excelled over the other for maintenance of cultures at room temperature. Most organisms survived well in all of the transport systems for 72 hours when refrigerated.

TI  - Puerperal endometritis: a prospective microbiologic study.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the flora in the endometrial cavity of two groups of puerperal patients: 47 afebrile control subjects and 27 with endometritis. A transcervical culturing technique designed to avoid cervical contamination and to preserve aerobes, anaerobes, and mycoplasma was employed, and bacterial colony counts were reported semiquantitatively. No difference was found in the flora of these two groups. Furthermore, the most common pathogenic organisms (in decreasing order of frequency) were peptostreptococci, peptococci, Bacteroides sp., gamma-streptococci, enterococci, beta-streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and E. coli.
TI  - Prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section.
AB  - Using a random selection procedure, 100 patients were evaluated in order to determine the value of prophylactic antibiotics in cesarean section. All patients were evaluated for febrile morbidity, and specific infection sites were recorded. Significant differences were found between the treated and control groups and between cesarean sections performed prior to the onset of labor and after the onset of labor.
TI  - Studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  - A study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. Three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on a rumen fluid roll tube medium (M98-5). Seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), Peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as Propionibacterium acnes and Eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as Bacteroides clostridiiformis, B. hypermegas and B. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as Clostridium sp.). Two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and Escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. The distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. Data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy source, minerals, reducing agent, Trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). The growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by CO(2) and rumen fluid. These preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen anaerobes.

TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  - Importance of the isovalerate carboxylation pathway of leucine biosynthesis in the rumen.
AB  - Certain anaerobic ruminal bacteria synthesize the leucine carbon skeleton by use  of a pathway different from that described in other microorganisms. These organisms carboxylate the intact carbon skeleton of isovalerate, synthesizing leucine-2-C(14) from isovalerate-1-C(14). Strains of Bacteroides ruminicola and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii were like Ruminococcus flavefaciens in that they incorporated appreciable amounts of C(14) from isovalerate-1-C(14) into cellular protein and in that the only labeled amino acid found was leucine. The specific activity of beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase in extracts from R. flavefaciens and from the mixed bacterial population from the rumen was very low as compared with the specific activity of this enzyme in extracts from Escherichia coli. This suggests that the pathway of leucine biosynthesis that operates in many aerobic and facultative microorganisms is not the major pathway in rumen bacteria. This was supported by the finding that after fermentation of whole rumen contents with acetate-2-C(14), leucine from the bacterial cells had a specific activity lower than one would expect if acetate was incorporated directly into carbons 1 and 2 of leucine.

TI  - ESTABLISHMENT OF HUMAN INDIGENOUS BACTERIA IN GERM-FREE MICE.
AB  - Gibbons, R. J. (Forsyth Dental Center and Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, Mass.), S. S. Socransky, and B. Kapsimalis. Establishment of human indigenous bacteria in germ-free mice. J. Bacteriol. 88:1316-1323. 1964.-Thirteen strains of bacteria indigenous to the gingival crevice area of man were tested for their ability to establish as monocontaminants in germ-free mice. Three facultative organisms, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus albus, and a "diphtheroid," established, as well as three anaerobes. Fusobacterium fusiforme, an anaerobic diphtheroid, and a Bacteroides strain. Seven other anaerobes (two strains of B. melaninogenicus, and one strain each of Treponema microdentium, Veillonella alcalescens, a Peptostreptococcus strain, Vibrio sputorum, and B. oralis) failed to establish. A mixture consisting of ten organisms representative of the predominant groups of cultivable bacteria present in the gingival crevice area of man was inoculated intraorally into germ-free mice. All organisms with the exception of B. melaninogenicus and T. microdentium became established as polycontaminants. Escherichia coli could be established in the above polycontaminated mice, as well as in those contaminated directly with human gingival debris. E. coli comprised approximately 50 and 6% of the fecal flora in the two groups, respectively. Diet, cecal contents, and feces of germ-free and polycontaminated mice were tested for inhibitory action against T. microdentium and B. melaninogenicus. None inhibited T. microdentium, whereas all three inhibited B. melaninogenicus. The inhibitory effect appeared to be due to dietary alfalfa. B. melaninogenicus could become established in mice monocontaminated with a facultative diptheroid and maintained on an alfalfa-free diet. These experiments indicate that human indigenous bacteria can become established in germ-free mice, and that microbial interactions and diet composition are important determinants.
