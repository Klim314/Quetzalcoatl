TI  == cloning and heterologous expression of plne, -f, -j and -k genes derived from soil metagenome and purification of active plantaricin peptides.
AB  == plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plne, -f, -j and -k structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. these amplicons were cloned and expressed in pet32a (+) vector in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). plne, -f, -j and -k peptides were expressed as his-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. the peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. the cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against listeria innocua nrrl b33314, micrococcus luteus mtcc 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as enterococcus casseliflavus nrrl b3502, lactococcus  lactis lactis nrrl 1821, lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b4562 and lactobacillus plantarum nrrl b4496. e. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-gua (fermented  cucumbers), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == background: jiang-gua (fermented cucumbers) is a popular traditional fermented food in taiwan. the microflora of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in jiang-gua have not been investigated in detail. in this study, lab from jiang-gua were isolated, characterised and identified. results: a total of 103 lab were isolated; 70 cultures were isolated from jiang-gua samples and 33 cultures were isolated from  its raw substrate, cucumber. these isolates were mainly characterised phenotypically and then divided into seven groups (a-g) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. the isolates were identified as enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, weissella cibaria and weissella  hellenica. the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined and 11 lc. lactis subsp. lactis strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t) . conclusion: heterofermentative w. cibaria and leu. lactis were the major lab found in jiang-gua samples without soy sauce. in soy sauce-added samples, homofermentative l. pentosus and l. plantarum  were the most abundant lab. in addition, the results also suggested that hhai and rsai restriction enzymes could be applied to distinguish w. hellenica and weissella paramesenteroides.

TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal italian goat cheese.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria community in traditional goat cheese produced in three dairies in valsesia (piemonte, italy) was studied at different steps of the manufacturing process. these cheeses were produced from raw milk without starter  bacteria, and no protocol was followed during the manufacturing process. three hundred thirty-two isolates were characterized and grouped by results of both morphophysiological tests and random amplification of polymorphic dna plus pcr analysis. bacteria were identified by partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. lactococci were the dominant lactic acid bacteria in raw milk. their initial numbers ranged from 5 to 7 log cfu ml(-1). their levels increased during manufacturing and decreased during ripening. the growth trend for enterococci was comparable to that of lactococci, although enterococci counts were lower. lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, lactococcus garviae, and enterococcus faecalis were the most frequently isolated species during goat cheese manufacturing, whereas the highest numbers of enterococcus (e. faecium, e. durans, e. gilvus, and e. casseliflavus) were isolated with the greatest frequency from ripened cheese samples. occasionally, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, and lactobacillus paraplantarum also were isolated.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. the cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. all isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. species-specific pcr using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis. the remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primer (gtg)(5)-(gtg)(5)-pcr, in combination with phenylalanyl-trna synthase gene (phes) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (sds-page). these strains were identified as enterococcus durans (59 strains), enterococcus italicus (8 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species lactococcus lactis. of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, e. durans, e. faecalis and e. faecium were present in all samples  studied, with e. faecium as the predominant one. the precise identification of enterococci in bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.

TI  == study of the ecology of fresh sausages and characterization of populations of lactic acid bacteria by molecular methods.
AB  == in this study, a polyphasic approach was used to study the ecology of fresh sausages and to characterize populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the microbial profile of fresh sausages was monitored from the production day to the  10th day of storage at 4 degrees c. samples were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 10, and culture-dependent and -independent methods of detection and identification were applied. traditional plating and isolation of lab strains, which were subsequently identified by molecular methods, and the application of pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to dna and rna extracted directly from the fresh sausage samples allowed the study in detail of the changes in the bacterial and yeast populations during storage. brochothrix thermosphacta and lactobacillus sakei were the main populations present. in particular, b. thermosphacta was present throughout the process, as determined by both dna and rna analysis. other bacterial species, mainly staphylococcus xylosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and l. curvatus, were detected by dgge. moreover, an uncultured bacterium and an uncultured staphylococcus sp. were present, too. lab strains isolated at day 0 were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. casei, and enterococcus casseliflavus, and on day 3 a strain of leuconostoc mesenteroides was identified. the remaining strains isolated belonged to l. sakei. concerning the yeast ecology, only debaryomyces hansenii was established in the fresh sausages. capronia mansonii was initially present, but it was not detected after the first 3 days. at last, l. sakei isolates were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr and repetitive dna element pcr. the results obtained underlined how different populations took over  at different steps of the process. this is believed to be the result of the selection of the particular population, possibly due to the low storage temperature employed.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == on the microbiological profile of traditional portuguese sourdough.
AB  == traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. to this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. more than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via biomerieux api galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. the dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (lab). the most frequently isolated yeasts were saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida pelliculosa. the most frequently isolated lab were (heterofermentative) leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) lactobacillus spp.; l. brevis, l. curvatus, and l. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the lactobacillus genera; lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; enterococcus casseliflavus, e. durans, and e. faecium for enterococci; and streptococcus constellantus and s. equinus for streptococci.

TI  == heterogeneity of plant-associated streptococci as characterized by phenotypic features and restriction analysis of pcr-amplified 16s rdna.
AB  == thirty-five strains of streptococci isolated from forage grasses were examined by restriction analysis of pcr-amplified 16s rdna. using a set of seven endonucleases, five 16s rdna genotypes were obtained. the isolates could be identified as belonging to the species enterococcus faecium, ent. mundtii, ent. faecalis, ent. casseliflavus and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, respectively. to assign the isolates to one of these species, digestion with the endonuclease hinfi was sufficient. data obtained from whole-cell protein analysis were in accordance with the species identification. additionally, three of the five species found were subdivided into two related subgroups. both methods are suitable for a rapid and unequivocal identification of plant-associated streptococci. the phenotypic characters showed a high diversity and were in some  cases contrary to the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. the results demonstrated the close relatedness of the determined species in contrast to their high phenotypic heterogeneity.

TI  == augmented production of extracellular superoxide by blood isolates of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == to assess the frequency of extracellular superoxide (o-2) production by enterococci, multiple species were surveyed in a whole organism assay for their ability to reduce ferricytochrome c in a superoxide dismutase-inhibitable fashion. for stool and clinical enterococcal isolates and 12 type strains, only enterococcus faecalis (87/91 isolates and atcc 19433), enterococcus faecium (5/13 isolates), enterococcus casseliflavus (atcc 25778), and enterococcus gallinarum (atcc 35038) produced extracellular o-2. among 106 strains comprising 13 species  of enteric gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci, only lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis produced extracellular o-2. mean (+/-se) rates of extracellular o-2 production in vitro by e . faecalis for isolates associated with bacteremia and endocarditis and for isolates from stool were 2.4+/-0.2, 1.9+/-0.2, 1.5+/-0.3 nmol of o-2 min(-1) 10(9) cfu(-1), respectively (p=.025, analysis of variance), suggesting an association between invasiveness and extracellular o-2 production.

TI  == presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. we isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, and enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other.  these bacteria were found in a variety of samples. enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. on the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein  profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as e. casseliflavus. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile  groups which could not be identified with the aid of known aerococcus, enterococcus, lactococcus, or streptococcus strains. the maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.

TI  == the distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups d and n.
AB  == the isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups d and n were investigated. streptococcus faecalis, s. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in s. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and s. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of s. cremoris, s. cremoris subsp. alactosus, s. lactis and s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. strains of s. avium, s. bovis, s. durans, s. equinus, s. faecium, s. raffinolactis and s. suis contained neither menaquinones  nor ubiquinones. the isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
