TI  == probiotic bifico cocktail ameliorates helicobacter pylori induced gastritis.
AB  == aim: to determine the protective effect of triple viable probiotics on gastritis  induced by helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) and elucidate the possible mechanisms  of protection. methods: colonization of bifico strains in the mouse stomach was determined by counting colony-forming units per gram of stomach tissue. after treatment with or without bifico, inflammation and h. pylori colonization in the  mouse stomach were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin and giemsa staining, respectively. cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and milliplex. the activation of nuclear factor (nf)-kappab and mapk signaling in human gastric epithelial cells was evaluated by western blot analysis. quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify tlr2, tlr4 and myd88 mrna expression in the mouse stomach. results: we demonstrated that bifico, which contains a mixture of enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus, was tolerant to the mouse stomach environment and was able to survive both the 8-h and 3-d courses of administration. although bifico treatment had no effect on the colonization of h. pylori in the mouse stomach, it ameliorated h. pylori-induced gastritis by significantly inhibiting the expression of cytokines and chemokines such as tnf-alpha, il-1beta, il-10, il-6, g-csf and mip-2 (p < 0.05). these results led us to hypothesize that bifico treatment would diminish the h. pylori-induced inflammatory response in gastric mucosal epithelial cells in vitro via the nf-kappab and mapk signaling pathways. indeed, we observed a decrease in the expression of the nf-kappab subunit p65 and in the phosphorylation of ikappab-alpha, erk and p38. moreover, there was a significant decrease in the production of il-8, tnf-alpha, g-csf and gm-csf (p < 0.05), and the increased expression of tlr2, tlr4 and myd88 induced by h. pylori in the stomach was also significantly reduced following bifico treatment (p < 0.05). conclusion: our results suggest that the probiotic cocktail bifico can ameliorate h. pylori-induced gastritis by inhibiting the inflammatory response in gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == effect of salt on cell viability and membrane integrity of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium longum as observed by flow cytometry.
AB  == the aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of varying sodium chloride concentrations (0-5%) on viability and membrane integrity of three probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium longum, using conventional technique and flow cytometry. double staining of cells by carboxyfluorescein diacetate (cfda) and propidium iodide (pi) enabled to evaluate the effect of nacl on cell esterase activity and membrane integrity. observations from conventional culture technique were compared with findings from flow cytometric analysis on the metabolic activities  of the cells and a correlation was observed between culturability and dye extrusion ability of l. casei and b. longum. however, a certain population of l.  acidophilus was viable as per the plate count method but its efflux activity was  compromised. esterase activity of most bacteria reduced significantly (p < 0.05)  during one week storage at nacl concentrations greater than 3.5%. the study revealed that l. casei was least affected by higher nacl concentrations among the three probiotic bacteria, as opposed to b. longum where the cf extrusion performance was greatly reduced during 1 wk storage. the metabolic activity and salt resistance of l. casei was found to be highest among the bacteria studied.

TI  == nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  == the biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. we measured nitrite, nitric oxide (no) and ammonia formation in cultures of escherichia coli, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. we found that the presence of 5 mm nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in e.coli and l.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract.  nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mm nitrate was present. time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. strains of l.rhamnosus, l.acidophilus and b.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. however, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, no gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates no by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. in contrast, nitrite was converted to no by e.coli cultures even at neutral ph. we suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related no formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/no metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.

TI  == cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and  exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions;  hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use  of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on  their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected  enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46  and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum  + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures  was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal  conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == probiotic bacteria, b. longum and l. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  == background and objectives: evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. methods: in vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus  infection were investigated in the vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (bifidobacterium  longum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. results and conclusions: of the tested probiotic strains, b. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and l. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. these probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, p = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the  present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis  or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == [correlation of the microbiota and intestinal mucosa in the pathophysiology and treatment of irritable bowel, irritable eye, and irritable mind syndrome].
AB  == accumulating clinical evidence supports co-morbidity of irritable bowel, irritable eye and irritable mind symptoms. furthermore, perturbation of the microbiota-host symbiosis (dysbiosis) is considered a common pathogenic mechanism connecting gastrointestinal, ocular and neuropsychiatric symptoms. consequently,  maintaining or restoring microbiota-host symbiosis represents a new approach to treat these symptoms or to prevent their relapses. current treatment approach assigned a primary role to live probiotics alone or in combination with prebiotics to enhance colonization of beneficial bacteria and to strengthen the symbiosis. however, several papers showed major benefits of heat-killed probiotics as compared to their live counterparts on both intestinal and systemic symptoms. recently, in addition to killing probiotics, in a proof of concept study lysates (fragments) of probiotics in combination with vitamins a, b, d and  omega 3 fatty acids were successfully tested. these findings suggested a conceptual change in the approach addressed to both the microbiota and host as targets for intervention.

TI  == effect of kcl substitution on bacterial viability of escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and selected probiotics.
AB  == excessive intake of nacl has been associated with the increased risk of several diseases, particularly hypertension. strategies to reduce sodium intake include substitution of nacl with other salts, such as kcl. in this study, the effects of nacl reduction and its substitution with kcl on cell membranes of a cheese starter bacterium (lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis), probiotic bacteria (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei), and a pathogenic bacterium (escherichia coli) were investigated using fourier-transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy. a critical nacl concentration that inhibited the viability of e. coli without affecting the viability of probiotic bacteria significantly was determined. to find the critical nacl concentration, de man, rogosa, and sharpe (mrs) broth was supplemented with a range of nacl concentrations [0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, and 5.0%], and the effect on cell viability and ftir spectra was monitored for all bacteria. a nacl concentration of 2.5% was found to be the critical level of nacl to inhibit e. coli without significantly affecting the viability of most of the probiotic bacteria and the cheese starter bacterium. the ftir spectral analysis also highlighted the changes that occurred mainly in the amide regions upon increasing the nacl concentration from 2.5 to 3.0% in most of  the bacteria. escherichia coli and b. longum were more sensitive to substitution  of nacl with kcl, compared with lb. acidophilus, lb. casei, and lc. lactis ssp. lactis. to evaluate the effect of substitution of nacl with kcl, substitution was carried out at the critical total salt concentration (2.5%, wt/vol) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% kcl). the findings suggest that 50% substitution of nacl with kcl, at 2.5% total salt, could inhibit e. coli without  affecting the probiotic bacteria.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == [application of multiplex pcr for analysis of polycomponent probiotic preparations].
AB  == aim: development of multiplex pcr for indication and differential analysis of cfu in a probiotic preparation containing 3 various species ofbifidobacteria (bifidobacterium bifidum, b. longum, b. adolescentis) and 2 species of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum). materials and methods; multiplex pcr with primers to 16s rna genes of 5 species of bacteria was applied. samples of bacterial colonies were removed from solid nutrient medium and transferred into test-tube for multiplex pcr execution. bacterial lysates were used as target-matrix for amplification and determination of presence of the required amplicons. results: multiplex pcr for detection of cfu of each of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains in samples of 5-component probiotic with  accuracy up to species was developed. a reagent kit was fine-tuned and high reproducibility and specificity of the multiplex pcr method with the accuracy of  90 - 95% of cases was shown. conclusion: the multiplex pcr method developed is recommended to be applied for cfu control of each bacterial component in a complex probiotic preparation.

TI  == in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of selected oxalate-degrading probiotic bacteria: potential applications in the prevention and treatment of hyperoxaluria.
AB  == oxalate (ox) is a very common component of the human diet, capable to collect in  the renal tissue and bind calcium to form calcium oxalate (caox) crystals. a supersaturation of caox crystal may cause nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. the inflammation derived from the caox crystal accumulation, together with innate or secondary renal alterations, could strongly affect the renal function. in this case a consumption of probiotics with either oxalate-degrading activity at intestinal level and systemic anti-inflammatory activity could be an alternative  approach to treat the subjects with excess of urinary oxalate excretion. 11 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria), already included in the list of bacteria safe for the human use, were investigated for their capability to degrade oxalate by mean of rp-hplc-uv method and modulate inflammation in an in vitro model system based on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. four promising bacterial strains (lactobacillus plantarum pbs067, lactobacillus acidophilus la-14, bifidobacterium breve pbs077, bifidobacterium longum pbs078) were identified as innovative biological tools for the prevention  and the therapeutic treatment of hyperoxaluria and the inflammatory events associated to the ox accumulation. practical application: the oxalate-degrading activity of some probiotics and their capability to modulate the release of inflammation mediators could be exploited as a new nutraceutical and therapeutic  approach for the treatment of oxalate accumulation and the related inflammatory state.

TI  == a randomized double-blind controlled trial: impact of probiotics on diarrhea in patients treated with pelvic radiation.
AB  == background & aims: radical radiation therapy is commonly used for treatment of pelvic cancer. up to 80% of patients receiving radiotherapy will develop acute radiation induced diarrhea. the primary aim of this randomized double blind controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of the probiotic bifilact((r)) on moderate and severe treatment-induced diarrhea during pelvic radiation. methods:  patients with pelvic cancers were treated between 2006 and 2010 at l'hotel-dieu de quebec, university health center. some patients had surgery before pelvic radiotherapy and some received chemotherapy. a total of 246 patients were randomized between a placebo and either of two regiments of double strain bifilact((r)) probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus lac-361 and bifidobacterium longum bb-536): a standard dose twice a day (1.3 billion cfu) or a high dose three times a day (10 billion cfu). patients were trained to record their digestive symptoms daily with a standardized scale and they met a registered dietician and radiation oncologist every week during treatment. the main analysis compared time to first appearance of grade >/=2-3-4 diarrhea using kaplan-meier curves as measured by proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea. results: 229 patients were analyzed. the difference between the groups  for overall grade 2-3-4 diarrhea was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). however at 60 days, the proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea in the standard dose group (35%) was more than twice as high as that of  the placebo group (17%) with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (p = 0.04). in patients who had surgery, the standard probiotics dose group had a better proportion of patients without very severe diarrhea than the placebo group, respectively 97% and 74% (p = 0.03). in all groups, the average number of bowel movements per day  during treatment was less than 3 soft stools (p = 0.80) and the median abdominal  pain less than 1 based on the national cancer institute scale (p = 0.23). conclusion: standard dose of bifilact((r)) may reduce radiation induced grade 2-3-4 diarrhea at the end of the treatment of patients with pelvic cancer. in patients operated on before rt, a standard dose of probiotics may reduce radiation induced grade 4 diarrhea. nutritional interventions by a registered dietician seemed to reduce global digestive symptoms. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov. identifier nct01839721.

TI  == cell-free preparations of lactobacillus acidophilus strain la-5 and bifidobacterium longum strain ncc2705 affect virulence gene expression in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter spp. are among the most commonly reported bacterial causes of acute diarrheal disease in humans worldwide. potential virulence factors include motility, chemotaxis, colonization ability, adhesion to intestinal cells, invasion and epithelial translocation, intracellular survival, and formation of toxins. probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains are known to have an  inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens. the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus strain la-5 and bifidobacterium longum strain ncc2705 cell-free spent media (cfsm) on the expression of virulence genes (cadf, cdtb, flaa, and ciab) of campylobacter jejuni strain 81-176 and a luxs mutant, using real-time pcr. our results demonstrated that the cfsm of both probiotic strains were able to down-regulate the expression of ciab (ratio of -2.80 and -5.51, respectively) and flaa (ratio of -7.00 and -5.13, respectively) in the wild-type campylobacter strain. in the luxs mutant, where the activated methyl cycle is disrupted, only the ciab gene (ratio -7.21) was repressed in the presence of la-5 cfsm. a supplementation of homocysteine to restore the disrupted cycle was able to partially reestablish the probiotic effect of both strains. luxs and the activated methyl cycle might play an active role in the modulation of virulence of c. jejuni by probiotic extracts.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

TI  == [outcomes of clostridium difficile enterocolitis after administration of antibiotics along with probiotic supplement].
AB  == introduction: clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a potentially fatal disease  showing increasing incidence in hospital environment. therapeutic approach in the management of clostridium difficile enterocolitis is highly complex, particularly because of its tendency to relapse and reinfection. the study was aimed at investigating the factors influencing the development of clostridium difficile enterocolitis and outcomes of enterocolitis after administration of standard antimicrobial therapy combined with probiotic supplement. material and methods: a non-comparative prospective observational study encompassed 42 patients (22 males and 20 females) diagnosed with clostridium difficile enterocolitis and treated at the department of infectious diseases in novi sad in the period october 2011 - april 2012. results: higher incidence of the disease was found in elderly patients (78.6% of them were over 60 years of age), after antimicrobial therapy (83.8%), after hospitalization (83.3%) and in comorbid conditions (85.7%). the clinical picture revealed predominantly mild to moderate symptoms. a good clinical response to the standard antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole, vancomycin) combined with probiotic given for 10 days was observed in all patients, and the improvement in parameters such as the number and appearance of  stools, abdominal distension and pain was recorded. statistically significant changes in laboratory parameters (leukocyte count, c-reactive protein level) were recorded on day 5 after the onset of disease. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in 9.5% of the patients. conclusion: administration of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11 and bifidobacterium longum rosell-175 alongside the standard antimicrobial therapy in the patients with clostridium difficile enterocolitis demonstrated positive effects on the severity or clinical picture and normalization of laboratory parameters. recurrent infection after successful  therapy was observed in only a small number of patients as compared with the literature data.

TI  == the applications of polysaccharides from various mushroom wastes as prebiotics in different systems.
AB  == the bases or stipes of mushrooms are normally discarded as low-economic value animal feed and compost. there are no known reports on deriving polysaccharides from these mushroom wastes for use as prebiotics. this study showed that the relatively low concentration (0.1% to 0.5%) of polysaccharides from lentinula edodes stipe, pleurotus eryngii base, and flammulina velutipes base can enhance the survival rate of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum during cold storage. the polysaccharides had synergistic effects with the peptides and amino acids from a yogurt culture to maintain probiotics above 10(7) cfu/ml during cold storage, and they also had significant protective effects on these probiotics in simulated gastric and bile  juice conditions to achieve beneficial effects in the host. these results showed  that mushroom wastes, which are cheaper than other sources, could be an important, new, alternative source of prebiotics.

TI  == in vitro growth of four individual human gut bacteria on oligosaccharides produced by chemoenzymatic synthesis.
AB  == the present study aimed at examining oligosaccharides (os) for potential stimulation of probiotic bacteria. nineteen structurally well-defined candidate os covering groups of beta-glucosides, alpha-glucosides and alpha-galactosides with degree of polymerization 2-4 were prepared in >100 mg amounts by chemoenzymatic synthesis (i.e. reverse phosphorolysis or transglycosylation). fourteen of the os are not naturally occurring and five (beta-d-glucosyl-fructose, beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-mannose, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-xylose; alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-l-fucose) have recently been synthesized for the first time. these os have not been previously tested for effects of bacterial growth and here the ability of all 19 os to support growth of four gastrointestinal bacteria: three probiotic bacteria bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and one commensal bacterium, bacteroides vulgatus has  been evaluated in monocultures. the disaccharides beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol and beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose noticeably stimulated growth yields of l. acidophilus ncfm, and additionally, beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose stimulated b. longum bl-05. alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-glucosamine and alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-n-acetyl-glucosamine enhanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum bl-05, whereas l. acidophilus ncfm and bac. vulgatus  did not grow on these os. alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-glucose advanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and l. acidophilus ncfm. thus several of the structurally well-defined os supported growth of beneficial gut bacteria. this reflects a broad specificity of their sugar transporters for os, including specificity for non-naturally occurring os, hence showing promise for design of novel prebiotics.

TI  == efficacy of different probiotic combinations on death and necrotizing enterocolitis in a premature rat model.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the most effective probiotic combinations to prevent death and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in a  premature rat model. methods: one hundred fifty-eight premature sprague-dawley premature rats were enrolled. probiotic strains bifidobacterium bifidum, b longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l plantarum, and b breve were fed as a single  strain or mixture with 2 or 3 strains for a total of 9 study groups; control groups received no exogenous probiotic supplement. fecal samples were collected for 72 hours to detect probiotic strains and pathologic strains by real-time polymerase chain reaction. colony counts of probiotic strains escherichia coli and klebsiella were compared between groups before and after 36 hours of the study period. the incidence of death and nec were compared via fisher exact test  between groups. results: the results demonstrated that l plantarum alone (p = 0.0026) and b bifidum with b longum together (p = 0.0017) were more effective in  reducing nec as compared with the control group. all of the study groups except b breve and b bifidum with b breve definitely prevented death compared with controls. b bifidum and b longum together had significantly lower mortality than  the control group (p < 0.0001). colony counts of e coli and klebsiella in stool samples were significantly decreased in the b bifidum, b longum, and l plantarum  group compared with the other study and control groups after 36 hours. conclusions: administration of a mixture of probiotic strains with b bifidum and  b longum was most effective in preventing death and nec in this animal model, and these observations provide an evidence-based strategy for designing further neonatal clinical trials.

TI  == physicochemical properties of scamorza ewe milk cheese manufactured with different probiotic cultures.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to produce functional scamorza cheese from gentile di puglia ewe milk by incorporating probiotic strains into the cheese matrix and to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of scamorza ewe milk cheese. gentile di puglia ewe bulk milk was used for scamorza cheese production.  cheeses were denoted s-co for control scamorza cheese, s-bb for scamorza cheese made using a mix of bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium lactis, and s-la for scamorza cheese made using lactobacillus acidophilus as probiotic strain. cheeses were analyzed at 1, 7, and 15 d of ripening. probiotic cell recovery in cheese was 7.55 +/- 0.07 log10 cfu/g and 9.09 +/- 0.04 log10 cfu/g in s-la and s-bb cheese, respectively; probiotic cheeses also displayed the highest levels of lactic microflora. reverse-phase hplc chromatograms of the water-soluble nitrogen fraction showed a more complex profile in s-bb, with distinctive peaks in the early-eluting zone. the matured scamorza cheese containing the mix of b. longum and b. lactis was characterized by significantly higher levels of gln, ser, arg,  ile, and leu, whereas cheese containing lb. acidophilus was characterized by higher levels of tyr and met. total ffa content was the highest in s-la, intermediate in s-bb, and the lowest in s-co cheese; in particular, scamorza cheese containing lb. acidophilus showed the highest level of vaccenic acid, oleic acid, and total conjugated linoleic acid. probiotic bacteria survived through the technological phases of pasta filata cheese production, maintained their specific metabolic pathways, and conferred functional properties to scamorza ewe milk cheese.

TI  == composition and sensory profiling of probiotic scamorza ewe milk cheese.
AB  == the present study aimed to assess the effect of the addition of different usually recognized as probiotic bacterial strains on chemical composition and sensory properties of scamorza cheese manufactured from ewe milk. to define the sensory profile of scamorza cheese, a qualitative and quantitative reference frame specific for a pasta filata cheese was constructed. according to the presence of  probiotic bacteria, cheeses were denoted s-bb for scamorza cheese made using a mix of bifidobacterium longum 46 and bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, and s-la for scamorza cheese made using lactobacillus acidophilus la-5. the designation for control scamorza cheese was s-co. analyses were performed at 15d of ripening. the moisture content of scamorza ewe milk cheese ranged between 44.61 and 47.16% (wt/wt), showing higher values in s-co and s-bb cheeses than in s-la cheese; the  fat percentage ranged between 25.43 and 28.68% (wt/wt), showing higher value in s-la cheese. the nacl percentage in scamorza cheese from ewe milk was 1.75 +/- 0.04% (wt/wt). protein and casein percentages were the highest in scamorza cheese containing a mix of bifidobacteria; also, the percentage of the proteose-peptone  fraction showed the highest value in s-bb, highlighting the major proteolysis carried out by enzymes associated with b. longum and b. lactis strains. texture and appearance attributes were able to differentiate probiotic bacteria-added cheeses from the untreated control product. in particular, s-bb and s-la scamorza cheeses showed higher color uniformity compared with s-co cheese. furthermore, the control cheese showed higher yellowness and lower structure uniformity than s-bb. the control product was less creamy and grainy than s-bb; conversely, the inclusion of probiotics into the cheese determined lower adhesivity and friability in s-bb and s-la than in s-co. this study allowed the definition of the principal composition and sensory properties of scamorza ewe milk cheese. the specific quantitative vocabulary for sensory analysis and reference frame for assessor training also established in this study should be implemented to systematically monitor the quality of this new typology of ewe milk cheese.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == enzymatic depolymerization of gum tragacanth: bifidogenic potential of low molecular weight oligosaccharides.
AB  == gum tragacanth derived from the plant "goat's horn" (astragalus sp.) has a long history of use as a stabilizing, viscosity-enhancing agent in food emulsions. the gum contains pectinaceous arabinogalactans and fucose-substituted xylogalacturonans. in this work, gum tragacanth from astragalus gossypinus was enzymatically depolymerized using aspergillus niger pectinases (pectinex be color). the enzymatically degraded products were divided into three molecular weight fractions via membrane separation: hag1 < 2 kda; 2 kda < hag2 < 10 kda; hag3 > 10 kda. compositional and linkage analyses showed that these three fractions also varied with respect to composition and structural elements: hag1 and hag2 were enriched in arabinose, galactose, and galacturonic acid, but low in fucose and xylose, whereas hag3 was high in (terminal) xylose, fucose, and 1,4-bonded galacturonic acid, but low in arabinose and galactose content. the growth-stimulating potential of the three enzymatically produced gum tragacanth fractions was evaluated via growth assessment on seven different probiotic strains in single-culture fermentations on bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (two strains), b. longum subsp. infantis (three strains), lactobacillus acidophilus , b. lactis, and on one pathogenic strain of clostridium perfringens  . the fractions hag1 and hag2 consistently promoted higher growth of the probiotic strains than hag3, especially of the three b. longum subsp. infantis strains, and the growth promotion on hag1 and hag2 was better than that on galactan (control). hag3 completely inhibited the growth of the c. perfringens strain. tragacanth gum is thus a potential source of prebiotic carbohydrates that exert no viscosity effects and which may find use as natural functional food ingredients.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and length of hospital stay in children with acute diarrhea in turkey: single blinded randomized study.
AB  == probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and this effect depends on the strains and dose. the aim of this study was to assess the effect of a synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and the length of hospital stay in children with acute watery diarrhea. this is a prospective randomized, multicenter single blinded clinical trial in hospitalized children with acute watery diarrhea. all children were treated with conventional  hydration therapy with or without a daily dose of a synbiotic (2.5 x 10(9) cfu live bacteria including lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, enterococcus faecium, and 625 mg fructooligosaccharide) for 5 days. the primary endpoint was duration of diarrhea  and duration of hospitalization was the secondary endpoint. among 209 eligible children, 113 received the synbiotic mixture and 96 served as a control. the duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter ( approximately 36 h) in children  receiving the synbiotic group than the controls (77.9 +/- 30.5 vs. 114.6 +/- 37.4 h, p < 0.0001). the duration of hospitalization was shorter in children receiving the synbiotic group (4.94 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.77 +/- 1.97 days, p = 0.002). the effect  of synbiotic mixture on diarrhea started after 24th hours and stool frequency significantly decreased after 24th and 48th hours. the percentage of diarrhea-free children is significantly higher in synbiotic group at 48th and 72nd hours of synbiotic group. in conclusion, this study showed a reduction in diarrhea duration by approximately 36 h and a reduction in the duration of hospitalization with approximately 1 day in children with acute diarrhea with this synbiotic mixture.

TI  == protection of probiotic bacteria in a synbiotic matrix following aerobic storage  at 4 degrees c.
AB  == the survival of single strains of bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri was investigated in synbiotics that included 10 mg/ml of fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides in an alginate matrix under refrigerated (4 degrees c) aerobic storage conditions. when the matrices were cross-linked with calcium (45  mm), 102-103 cfu/ml of l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, and 0-103 cfu/ml of b. breve and b. longum survived refrigerated aerobic storage for 28 days. following  refrigerated storage, acetic (3-9 mm), butyric (0-2 mm), propionic (5-16 mm) and  lactic acids (1-48 mm) were produced during the growth of probiotics in bhi broth at 37 degrees c, suggesting their metabolic activity after storage was stressed.  when calcium cross-linking was not used in synbiotics, the matrix remained more gel-like after inoculation when compared to the calcium cross-linked matrix. at least 107 cfu/ml of probiotic bacteria survived after 21 days of storage within these gel-like alginate matrices. significantly higher levels of b. breve, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri were obtained from the synbiotic matrices supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides, inulin and pectic-oligosaccharides compared to alginate alone. b. longum survival was the same (~7 logs) in all gel-like synbiotic matrices. these results show that synbiotics protected probiotic bacteria and extended their shelf-life under refrigerated aerobic conditions. synbiotics represent a viable delivery vehicle for health-promoting bacteria.

TI  == probiotic cheese attenuates exercise-induced immune suppression in wistar rats.
AB  == intense physical activity results in a substantial volume of stress and hence a significant probability of immunosuppression in athletes, with milk proteins being, perhaps, the most recommended protein supplements. consumption of a probiotic cheese can attenuate immune suppression induced by exhausting exercise  in rats. a popular brazilian fresh cheese (minas frescal cheese) containing lactobacillus acidophilus la14 and bifidobacterium longum bl05 was fed for 2wk to adult wistar rats, which then were brought to exhaustion on the treadmill. two hours after exhaustion, the rats were killed and material was collected for the determination of serum uric acid, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol  fraction, total protein, triacylglycerols, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and blood cell (monocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and leukocyte) counts. exercise was efficient in reducing lymphocyte  counts, irrespective of the type of ingested cheese, but the decrease in the group fed the probiotic cheese was 22% compared with 48% in the animals fed regular cheese. monocyte counts were unaltered in the rats fed probiotic cheese compared with a significant decrease in the rats fed the regular cheese. most importantly, ingestion of the probiotic cheese resulted in a >100% increase in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a 50% decrease in triacylglycerols. we conclude that probiotic minas frescal cheese may be a viable alternative to enhance the immune system and could be used to prevent infections, particularly those related to the physical overexertion of athletes.

TI  == encapsulation of probiotic bacteria in lamb rennet paste: effects on the quality  of pecorino cheese.
AB  == lamb rennet pastes containing encapsulated lactobacillus acidophilus and a mix of bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium lactis were produced for pecorino cheese manufacture from gentile di puglia ewe milk. cheeses were denoted as rp cheese when made with traditional rennet paste, rp-l cheese when made with rennet paste containing l. acidophilus culture, and rp-b cheese when made with rennet paste containing a mix of b. lactis and b. longum. biochemical features of pecorino cheese were studied at 1, 15, 30, 60, and 120 d of cheese ripening. the  effect of encapsulation and bead addition to rennet acted on a different way on the viability of probiotic. lactobacillus acidophilus retained its viability for  4 to 5 d and then showed a fast reduction; on the other hand, b. longum and b. lactis experienced kinetics characterized by an initial death slope, followed by  a tail effect due to acquired resistance. at 1 d of ripening, the levels of l. acidophilus and bifidobacteria in cheese were the lowest, and then increased, reaching the highest levels after 30 d; such cell loads were maintained throughout the ripening for l. acidophilus, whereas bifidobacteria experienced a  decrease of about 1 log cfu/g at the end of ripening. enzymatic activities and biochemical features of cheeses were influenced by the type of rennet used for cheesemaking. greater enzymatic activity was recorded in rp-l and rp-b cheese due to the presence of probiotic bacteria released from alginate beads. a positive correlation was found between enzymatic activities and water-soluble nitrogen and proteose-peptone in rp-b and rp-l cheeses; water-soluble nitrogen and proteose-peptone were the highest in rp-b. principal component analysis distinguished rp-l from the other cheeses on the basis of the conjugated linoleic acid content, which was higher in the rp-l due to the ability of l. acidophilus to produce conjugated linoleic acid in the cheese matrix.

AB  == the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line crl-9850 to lactobacillus acidophilus lavri-a1, lb. rhamnosus gg, exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st1275, bifidobacteriun longum bl536, b. lactis b94 and escherichia coli tg1 strains. the production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by pbmc following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (git)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant  secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from pbmc-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. bifidobacteria and s. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory t cells (t(reg) )/t helper type 17 (th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of th17 and t(reg) cells after pbmc exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. these studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of  th17 and t(reg) cells.

TI  == expression and characterization of an endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from emericella nidulans in pichia pastoris for enzymatic design of potentially prebiotic oligosaccharides from potato galactans.
AB  == potato pulp is a high-volume side-stream from industrial potato starch manufacturing. enzymatically solubilized beta-1,4-galactan-rich potato pulp polysaccharides of molecular weights >100 kda (sppp) are highly bifidogenic in human fecal sample fermentations in vitro. the objective of the present study was to use potato beta-1,4-galactan and the sppp as substrates for enzymatic production of potentially prebiotic compounds of lower and narrower molecular weight. a novel endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from emericella nidulans (anamorph aspergillus nidulans), gh family 53, was produced in a recombinant pichia pastoris strain. the enzyme was purified by cu(2+) affinity chromatography and its optimal reaction conditions were determined to ph 5 and 49 degrees c via a statistical experimental design. the specific activity of the e. nidulans enzyme  expressed in p. pastoris was similar to that of an endo-1,4-beta-galactanase from aspergillus niger used as benchmark. the e. nidulans enzyme expressed in p. pastoris generated a spectrum poly- and oligo-saccharides which were fractionated by membrane filtration. the potential growth promoting properties of each fraction were evaluated by growth of beneficial gut microbes and pathogenic bacteria. all the galactan- and sppp-derived products promoted the growth of probiotic strains of bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus and generally did not support the propagation of clostridium perfringens in single culture fermentations. notably the growth of b. longum was significantly higher (p<0.05) or at least as good on galactan- and sppp-derived products as fructooligosaccharides (fos). except in one case these products did not support the growth of the pathogen cl. perfringens to any significant extent.

TI  == the effect of a multispecies probiotic mixture on the symptoms and fecal microbiota in diarrhea-dominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: the clinical effect of probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is still controversial. aims: we aimed to evaluate the effects of a probiotic mixture on ibs symptoms and the composition of fecal microbiota in patients with  diarrhea-dominant ibs (d-ibs). methods: fifty patients with d-ibs were randomized into placebo or probiotic mixture (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and streptococcus thermophilus 1.0x10 cfu) groups. treatment was taken daily for 8 weeks. the primary outcome was adequate relief (ar) of overall ibs symptoms, which was assessed weekly for 10 weeks. a responder was defined as a patient who experienced ar for at least half of the 10-week study period. secondary outcomes included the effects on individual symptoms, stool parameters, and ibs quality of life. the fecal flora compositions were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the proportion of ar was consistently higher in  the probiotics group than in the placebo group throughout the 10-week period (p<0.05). the proportion of responders was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (48% vs. 12%, p=0.01). stool consistency improved significantly in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group. percent changes in individual symptom scores were similar in the 2 groups, but ibs quality of life improvement tended to be higher in the probiotics group. comparison of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of fecal flora showed that the concordance rate between bacterial compositions before and after  treatment was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (69.5% vs. 56.5%, p=0.005). conclusions: the probiotic mixture was effective in providing ar of overall ibs symptoms and improvement of stool consistency in d-ibs patients, although it had no significant effect on individual symptoms. the therapeutic effect of probiotics is associated with the  stabilization of intestinal microbiota.

TI  == the combination of mixed lactic acid bacteria and dietary fiber lowers serum cholesterol levels and fecal harmful enzyme activities in rats.
AB  == probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria (lab) and prebiotics such as fiber are generally considered beneficial for health. these affect the microflora composition and fermentation metabolites and consequently contribute to local and systemic effects in humans. the beneficial effects of probiotics can be improved  when combined with prebiotics. here we investigated the effects of a mixed lab supplement combined with dietary fiber on the population of lab in the gut, as well as on serum cholesterol levels, fecal water content and microbial harmful enzyme activities. for animal studies, 0.2 ml of mixed lab (bifidobacterium longum spm1205, lactobacillus acidophilus, and safelac isolated from pediococcus  pentosaceus) supplement (10(7) approximately 10(8) colony forming units per day)  was orally administered to male sprague-dawley rats every day for 2 weeks along with a diet containing 5% or 10% cellulose. the mixed lab supplement combined with dietary cellulose significantly (p < 0.05) reduced serum total cholesterol and ldl levels. this combination also significantly (p < 0.05) increased the population of lab and the fecal water content and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced microbial harmful enzyme (beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and tryptophanase) activities. these effects of lab were particularly improved by its combination with 5% cellulose compared to the control (a diet without cellulose), and the 5% cellulose combination was more effective than the 10% cellulose combination. in conclusion, the incorporation of a fibrous diet such as cellulose with lactic acid bacteria improved the population of lab, and daily consumption of this combination could reduce the serum cholesterol levels and activities of harmful enzymes such as beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, tryptophanase, urease in rats.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

AB  == the fermentability of rice bran (rb), alone or in combination with one of two probiotics, by canine faecal microbiota was evaluated in stirred, ph-controlled,  anaerobic batch cultures. rb enhanced the levels of bacteria detected by probes bif164 (bifidobacteria) and lab158 (lactic acid bacteria); however, addition of the probiotics did not have a significant effect on the predominant microbial counts compared with rb alone. rb sustained levels of bifidobacterium longum 05 throughout the fermentation; in contrast, lactobacillus acidophilus 14 150b levels decreased significantly after 5-h fermentation. rb fermentation induced changes in the short-chain fatty acid (scfa) profile. however, rb combined with probiotics did not alter the scfa levels compared with rb alone. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of samples obtained at 24 h showed a treatment effect with rb, which was not observed in the rb plus probiotic systems. overall, the negative controls displayed lower species richness than the treatment systems and their banding profiles were distinct. this study illustrates the ability of a common ingredient found in pet food to modulate the  canine faecal microbiota and highlights that rb may be an economical alternative  to prebiotics for use in dog food.

TI  == probiotics in the treatment of acute rotavirus diarrhoea. a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial using two different probiotic preparations in bolivian children.
AB  == background: evidence suggests that probiotics reduce rotavirus diarrhoea duration. although there are several probiotic strains potentially useful, daily  practice is often limited by the type and number of products locally available. in general, information about combined products is scarce. in this study we compare the effect of two probiotic products in the treatment of diarrhoea in children less than 2 years of age. methods: a randomized double-blind controlled  clinical trial in children hospitalized for acute rotavirus diarrhoea, in the paediatric centre albina patino, cochabamba, bolivia.participants were children aged 1 - 23 months, who were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: oral rehydration therapy plus placebo; oral rehydration solution plus saccharomyces boulardii; or oral rehydration solution plus a compound containing  lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum and saccharomyces boulardii. sample size was 20 per group and the outcomes were duration of diarrhoea, of fever, of vomiting and of hospitalization. results: 64  cases finished the protocol. on admission, patients' characteristics were similar. median duration of diarrhoea (p = 0.04) in children who received the single species product (58 hours) was shorter than in controls (84.5 hrs). comparing children that received the single probiotic product and controls showed shorter duration of fever (18 vs 67 hrs) (p = 0.0042) and the mixed probiotic of  vomiting (0 vs 42.5 hrs) (p = 0.041). there was no effect on duration of hospitalization (p = 0.31). when experimental groups were merged, statistical significance of changes increased (total duration of diarrhoea, fever and vomiting p = 0.025, p = 0.025 and p = 0.014, respectively). conclusions: both products decreased the duration of diarrhoea compared to oral rehydration solution alone. this decrease was significant only for the single species product which also decreased the duration of fever. with the multiple species product there was no vomiting subsequent to the initiation of treatment. the quantity of  probiotic bacteria needed for optimum treatment of gastroenteritis remains to be  determined, particularly when multiple species are included in the product.trial  registration: clinicaltrials.gov id: nct00981877link: https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/prs/app/action/selectprotocol/sid/s0002653/se lectaction/view/ts/2/uid/u0000n04 trial registration: clinical trials nct id: nct00981877.

TI  == biochemical patterns in ovine cheese: influence of probiotic strains.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of lamb rennet paste containing  probiotic strains on proteolysis, lipolysis, and glycolysis of ovine cheese manufactured with starter cultures. cheeses included control cheese made with rennet paste, cheese made with rennet paste containing lactobacillus acidophilus  culture (la-5), and cheese made with rennet paste containing a mix of bifidobacterium lactis (bb-12) and bifidobacterium longum (bb-46). cheeses were sampled at 1, 7, 15, and 30 d of ripening. starter cultures coupled with probiotics strains contained in rennet paste affected the acidification and coagulation phases leading to the lowest ph in curd and cheese containing probiotics during ripening. as consequence, maturing cheese profiles were different among cheese treatments. cheeses produced using rennet paste containing probiotics displayed higher percentages of alpha(s1)-i-casein fraction than traditional cheese up to 15 d of ripening. this result could be an outcome of the greater hydrolysis of alpha-casein fraction, attributed to higher activity of the residual chymosin. further evidence for this trend is available in chromatograms  of water-soluble nitrogen fractions, which indicated a more complex profile in cheeses made using lamb paste containing probiotics versus traditional cheese. differences can be observed for the peaks eluted in the highly hydrophobic zone being higher in cheeses containing probiotics. the proteolytic activity of probiotic bacteria led to increased accumulation of free amino acids. their concentrations in cheese made with rennet paste containing lb. acidophilus culture and cheese made with rennet paste containing a mix of b. lactis and b. longum were approximately 2.5 and 3.0 times higher, respectively, than in traditional cheese. principal component analysis showed a more intense lipolysis  in terms of both free fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid content in probiotic cheeses; in particular, the lipolytic pattern of cheeses containing lb. acidophilus is distinguished from the other cheeses on the basis of highest content of health-promoting molecules. the metabolic activity of the cheese microflora was also monitored by measuring acetic, lactic, and citric acids during cheese ripening. cheese acceptability was expressed for color, smell, taste, and texture perceived during cheese consumption. use of probiotics in trial cheeses did not adversely affect preference or acceptability; in fact, panelists scored probiotic cheeses higher in preference over traditional cheese,  albeit not significantly.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

AB  == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis  was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

TI  == effect of a synbiotic food consumption on human gut metabolic profiles evaluated  by (1)h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  == the capacity of human lactobacilli and bifidobacteria to produce metabolites under conditions that may prevail in the human intestine has been studied "in vitro". however, the effect of systematic probiotic consumption on human metabolic phenotype has not been investigated in faeces. this paper shows the potential for the use of (1)h nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)h nmr) spectroscopy  for studying the changes of the metabolic profiles of human faecal slurries. faeces of 16 subjects, characterized by different natural levels of lactobacilli  and bifidobacteria were recovered before and after 1 month of supplementation with a synbiotic food based on lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum  and fructooligosaccharides, and analyzed by (1)h nmr. multivariate statistical approach has been applied to the data obtained and particularly canonical discriminant analysis of principal coordinates (cap). more than 150 molecules belonging to short chain fatty acids, organic acids, esters, alcohols and amino acids were detected and quantified in the samples considered. the number and the  extent of these molecules in faecal slurries were strongly affected by the synbiotic food consumption and gave rise to characteristic metabolic signature. in particular, the short chain fatty acid concentrations significantly increased  while the amino acids contents decreased. the comparison of the data indicated that the intake of the synbiotic food alters the host metabolism in a measure dependent on the initial level of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria detected in the faecal specimens. the analysis of (1)h nmr profiles with cap allowed a separation of faecal samples of the subjects on the basis of the synbiotic food intake. the  multivariate statistical approach used demonstrated the potential of nmr metabolic profiles to provide biomarkers of the gut-microbial activity related to dietary supplementation of probiotics.

TI  == an improved method of microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria for their stability in acidic and bile conditions during storage.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to develop a method for applying an extra coating of palm oil and poly-l-lysine (popl) to alginate (alg) microcapsules to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria. eight strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l.  acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-o4, and b. lactis type bi-07 were encapsulated using alginate alone or alginate with popl. electron microscopy was  used to measure the size of the microcapsules and to determine their surface texture. to assess if the addition of popl improved the viability of probiotic bacteria in acidic conditions, both alg and popl microcapsules were inoculated into ph 2.0 mrs broths and their viability was assessed over a 2-h incubation period. two bile salts including oxgall bile salt and taurocholic acid were used  to test the bile tolerance of probiotic bacteria entrapped in alg and popl microcapsules. to assess the porosity and the ability of the microcapsule to hold small molecules in an aqueous environment a water-soluble fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6 fam), was encapsulated and its release was monitored using a uv spectrophotometer. the results indicated that coating the microcapsules with popl increased the overall size of the capsules by an average of 3 microm +/- 0.67. however, microcapsules with added popl had a much smoother surface texture  when examined under an electron microscope. the results also indicated that the addition of popl to microcapsules improved the average viability of probiotic bacteria by > 1 log cfu/ml when compared to alg microcapsules at 2 h of exposure  to acidic conditions. however, similar plate counts were observed between alg and popl microcapsules when exposed to bile salts. this suggests that an extra coating of popl could be readily broken down by bile salts that are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (git). upon testing the porosity of the microcapsules, findings suggest that popl microcapsules were less porous and hold 52.2% more fluorescent dye over a 6-wk storage period.

TI  == effect of various encapsulating materials on the stability of probiotic bacteria.
AB  == ten probiotic bacteria, including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-04, b. lactis type bi-07, howaru l. rhamnosus, and howaru b. bifidum, were encapsulated in various coating materials, namely alginate, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, and carrageenan gum. the various encapsulated probiotic bacteria were studied for their acid and bile tolerance. free probiotic organisms were used as a control. the acid tolerance of probiotic organisms was tested at ph 2 over a 2-h incubation period. bile tolerance was tested with taurocholic acid over an 8-h incubation period. the permeability of the capsules was also examined using a water-soluble dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6-cf). the permeability  was monitored by measuring the amount of 6-cf released from the capsules during a 2-w storage period. results indicated that probiotic bacteria encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum survived better (p < 0.05) than free probiotic bacteria, under acidic conditions. when free probiotic bacteria were exposed to taurocholic acid, viability was reduced by 6.36 log cfu/ml, whereas only 3.63, 3.27, and 4.12 log cfu/ml was lost in probiotic organisms encapsulated in alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum, respectively. all encapsulating materials tested released small amounts of 6-cf; however, alginate and xanthan gum retained 22.1% and 18.6% more fluorescent dye than guar gum. in general, microcapsules made of alginate, xanthan gum, and carrageenan gum greatly improved the survival of probiotic bacteria when exposed to acidic conditions and bile salts.

TI  == probiotic in lamb rennet paste enhances rennet lipolytic activity, and conjugated linoleic acid and linoleic acid content in pecorino cheese.
AB  == cheeses manufactured using traditional lamb rennet paste, lamb rennet paste containing lactobacillus acidophilus, and lamb rennet paste containing a mix of bifidobacterium lactis and bifidobacterium longum were characterized for the lipolytic pattern during ripening. lipase activity of lamb rennet paste, lamb rennet containing lb. acidophilus, and lamb rennet containing a mix of bifidobacteria was measured in sheep milk cream substrate. rennet paste containing probiotics showed a lipase activity 2-fold greater than that displayed by traditional rennet. total free fatty acid (ffa) in sheep milk cream was lower  in lamb rennet paste (981 microg/g of milk cream) than in lamb rennet containing  lb. acidophilus (1,382.4 microg/g of milk cream) and in lamb rennet containing a  mix of bifidobacteria (1,227.5 microg/g of milk cream) according to lipase activity of lamb rennet paste. the major increase of ffa in all cheeses occurred  during the first 30 d of ripening with the greatest values being observed for c16:0, c18:0 c18:1. at 60 d of ripening all cheeses showed a reduction in the amount of free fatty acids; in particular, total free fatty acids underwent a decrease of more than 30% from 30 to 60 d in cheeses manufactured using traditional lamb rennet paste, whereas the same parameter decreased 10% in cheeses manufactured using lamb rennet paste containing lb. acidophilus and cheeses manufactured using lamb rennet paste containing a mix of b. lactis and b. longum. cheese containing lb. acidophilus was characterized by the greatest levels of total conjugated linoleic acids (cla) 9-cis, 11-trans cla and 9-trans,  11-trans cla, whereas cheese containing bifidobacteria displayed the greatest levels of free linoleic acid. rennet pastes containing viable cells of lb. acidophilus and a mix of b. lactis and b. longum were able to influence the amount of ffa and cla in pecorino cheese during ripening.

TI  == quantification of bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. in rat fecal samples by real-time pcr.
AB  == the microbiota of the rat intestinal tract constitutes a complex ecosystem of microorganisms. we have developed a real-time quantitative pcr assay based on genus-specific 16s rdna primers and 3' minor groove binder (mgb) probes for accurate detection and quantification of a wide range of bifidobacterium spp. (30 species) and lactobocillus spp. (15 species) in rat fecal samples. real-time pcr  detection of serially diluted dna isolated from reference strains of bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus was linear for cell counts ranging from 10(6) to 10 cells per pcr assay. the method proved applicable to the detection of bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. at concentrations down to 10 cfu per pcr, corresponding to 5 x 10(4) cfu/g feces. the inter-extract reproducibility was high, with a coefficient of variation ranging from 0.24% to 1.07% for the bifidobacterium assay and from 0.05% to 1.28% for the lactobacillus assay. we conclude that real-time pcr is a very sensitive and precise technique for extensive quantitative evaluation of gut bifidobacterium spp. and lactobacillus spp. thus, the approach used here to detect and quantify bacteria with group-specific primers should contribute to further studies of the composition and dynamics of the rat intestinal microbiota.

TI  == development and use of tuf gene-based primers for the multiplex pcr detection of  lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei group, lactobacillus delbrueckii,  and bifidobacterium longum in commercial dairy products.
AB  == pcr primers specific for the detection of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei group, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and bifidobacterium longum  were designed based on the elongation factor tu gene (tuf). the specificity of these four primer sets were confirmed by pcr with 88 bacterial strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium, and other bacterial species. results indicated that these primer sets generated predicted pcr products of 397, 230, 202, and 161 bp for l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei group, and b. longum, respectively. bacterial species other than the target organisms tested did not generate false-positive results. when these four primer sets were combined for the simultaneous detection of the lactic acid bacteria (lab) in fermented milk products including yogurt, the lab species listed on the labels of these products could be identified without the preenrichment step. the identification limit for each lab strain with this multiplex pcr method was n x 10(3) cfu/ml in milk samples. the results of our multiplex pcr method were confirmed by pcr assay using primers based on the 16s rdna or the 16s-23s intergenic spacer region and by biochemical tests using the api 50 chl kit. when  this multiplex pcr method was used with the determination of counts of total viable lab and bifidobacteria, the quality of commercial fermented milk products  could be assured.

TI  == probiotic food supplement reduces stress-induced gastrointestinal symptoms in volunteers: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.
AB  == stress plays an important role in the development of symptoms contributing to disease. stress induces various disorders with gastrointestinal, physical, and psychological symptoms. probiotics can help regulate or modulate gastrointestinal functions. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a probiotic preparation (probio-stick) on stress-induced symptoms in volunteers. a  double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study was conducted on volunteers with symptoms of stress. subjects received a probiotic (probio-stick; lallemand sas, saint-simon, france) containing lactobacillus acidophilus rosell-52 and bifidobacterium longum rosell-175 (3 x 10(9) colony-forming units per sachet stick) or a sensorially identical placebo without probiotics during a 3-week period. the consumption of probiotics significantly reduced 2 stress-induced gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting) for intention-to-treat or per-protocol populations. in contrast, the probiotics did not significantly modify the other physical and psychological symptoms and sleep  problems induced by stressful life events for intention-to-treat or per-protocol  populations. the results indicate that probio-stick can provide a beneficial effect on the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by individuals affected by chronic stress.

TI  == kinetics of microbial hydrogenation of free linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic  acids.
AB  == aims: to investigate the ability of selected probiotic bacterial strains to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and also to estimate the biohydrogenation  kinetics of lactobacillus acidophilus on the production of cla from free linoleic acid (la). methods and results: six probiotic bacteria, lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus gg, lact. acidophilus adh, and bifidobacterium longum b6, lact. brevis, and lact. casei, were used to examine their ability to convert la to cla. la tolerance was evaluated by addition of different la concentrations in mrs broth.  lact. acidophilus showed the major tolerant to la and the greatest cla-producing  ability (36-48 microg ml(-1) of cla). the rate-controlling steps were k(2) and k(1) for the addition of 1 and 3 mg ml(-1) of la, respectively. the percentage of cla conversion was higher in mrs broth supplemented with 1 mg ml(-1) (65%) than 3 mg ml(-1) (26%). conclusion: the results provide useful information and new approach for understanding the biohydrogenation mechanisms of cla production. significance and impact of the study: this study would help elucidate the pathway from la to stearic acid (sa), known as biohydrogenation. in addition, the use of  selected probiotic bacteria might lead to a significant improvement in food safety.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria prevent alcohol-induced steatohepatitis in rats by acting on the pathways of alcohol metabolism.
AB  == the objective is to study the possible mechanism by which lactic acid bacteria (lab) prevent alcohol-induced steatohepatitis in rats. a total of 25 wistar rats  were divided into three groups: a lab-fed group, an alcohol-treated group and a control group. both the lab-fed group and the alcohol-treated group received alcohol (10 g kg(-1) per day) orally for up to 5 days (125 h). before exposure to alcohol, the lab-fed group were first treated daily with 1.5 ml/100 g of a mixture comprising 4 x 10(10) ml(-1) of lactobacillus acidophilus and 2.5 x 10(7) ml(-1) of bifidobacterium longum, while the control group was treated with normal saline only. biochemical data, alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) activity and histology of the liver and stomach were evaluated. the adh activity in the lab mixture was  3.52 +/- 0.45 mumol mg(-1) protein (10(9) cfu ml(-1)), and was dose-dependent. by 30 min after taking alcohol, serum alcohol concentrations were 514.24 +/- 80.21 microg ml(-1) in the lab-fed group and 795.15 +/- 203.45 microg ml(-1) in the alcohol-treated group (p < 0.005). serum alcohol concentrations were reduced by 48% (p < 0.01) in the lab-fed group, but by only 4% in the alcohol-treated group  (p > 0.05) 120 min after oral intake of alcohol. the blood levels of endotoxin, ast and alt were improved in the lab-fed group compared to the alcohol-fed group  (p < 0.01). all alcohol-treated rats showed moderate to severe steatohepatitis, but the lab-fed rats showed almost normal histology or very slight lesions only.  in conclusion, lab decreased the alcohol concentration in the blood by increasing the first-pass metabolism in both the stomach and the liver, and effectively protected against alcohol-induced gastric and liver injury. it is interesting to  note that the protection was more effective in the liver.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

AB  == background: this study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (ppi)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful helicobacter pylori eradication. materials and methods:  three hundred and forty-seven h. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a  triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control  group, n = 179). triple therapy consisted of ppi b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. will yogurt (a korean brand) contains lactobacillus acidophilus hy2177, lactobacillus casei hy2743, bifidobacterium longum hy8001, and streptococcus thermophilus b-1. (13)c-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. results: by intention-to treat analysis the h. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). however,  by per-protocol (pp) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). the frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than  in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). however, most adverse events  were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). conclusions: the addition of will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. but it increased the h. pylori eradication rate by pp analysis, encouraging more research in this field.

TI  == therapeutic potential of two probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease as observed in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid model of colitis.
AB  == purpose: the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. one of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. administration of probiotic bacteria  reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune  system. in the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. methods: male wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16s rrna gene primers. results: probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of  the pathogenic bacteria aeromonas and escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. however, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only lactobacillus gg administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. conclusions: we report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.

TI  == dendritic cells from peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes differ from spleen dendritic cells in their response to commensal gut bacteria.
AB  == commensal gut bacteria have potent effects on the immune system, which are partially mediated by intestinal dendritic cells (dc). distinct commensals confer different properties to in vitro-generated dc. the aim of the present study was to reveal strain-dependent maturation patterns in primary dc. to this end, we compared the response of mouse peyer's patch (pp) dc, mesenteric lymph node (mln) dc and spleen dc to the commensal bacteria, bifidobacterium longum q46, lactobacillus acidophilus x37 and escherichia coli nissle 1917. bacterial maturation of dc occurred independently of tissue origin. expression of ccr7 and  cd103 on the surface of mln dc, necessary for the induction of gut-homing regulatory t cells, increased with stimulation by gram-positive commensals. bacteria-dependent cytokine production (il-6, il-10 and tnf-alpha) was similar in spleen and mln dc, and contaminant cells in these dc preparations produced ifn-gamma in response to l. acidophilus. in contrast, pp dc produced il-6 only in response to e. coli, little il-10 and no tnf-alpha, and this low cytokine production was not due to inhibition by il-10 or tgf-beta. bifidobacteria downregulate il-6, tnf-alpha and il-12 production induced in in vitro-generated dc by l. acidophilus. similar inhibition was observed in splenic dc, but not in mln dc. mln cells responded to bacterial stimulation with higher ifn-gamma production than spleen cells, possibly due to the presence of more responsive natural killer cells. commensal bacteria therefore play specific roles in the gut immune system distinguishable from the effect they would have if recognized by the systemic immune system.

TI  == interaction of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of il-8 production.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. the depletion of the individual  microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. in order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. in this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. according to our experimental data, lactobacillus acidophilus bar13, l. plantarum bar10, bifidobacterium longum bar33 and b. lactis bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli h10407 from a caco-2 cell layer. moreover, l. acidophilus bar13 and b. longum bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on il-8 production by ht29 cells. both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. these probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional  foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.

TI  == molecular studies of fecal anaerobic commensal bacteria in acute diarrhea in children.
AB  == background and objective: the commensal bacterial flora of the colon may undergo  changes during diarrhea, owing to colonization of the intestine by pathogens and  to rapid intestinal transit. this study used molecular methods to determine changes in the composition of selected commensal anaerobic bacteria during and after acute diarrhea in children. materials and methods: fecal samples were obtained from 46 children with acute diarrhea in a rural community during an episode of acute diarrhea, immediately after recovery from diarrhea, and 3 months after recovery. dna was extracted and quantitative polymerase chain reaction using sybr green and genus- and species-specific primers targeting 16s rdna were  undertaken to quantitate the following groups of bacteria: bifidobacterium spp.,  bifidobacterium longum group, bacteroides-prevotella group, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus acidophilus group, faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and eubacterium rectale, relative to amplification of universal bacterial domain 16s rdna. results: bacteria belonging to the bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, e  rectale, l acidophilus, and f prauznitzii groups were low during acute diarrhea compared with their levels after recovery from diarrhea. the pattern was similar  in rotavirus diarrhea and nonrotavirus diarrhea. administration of amylase-resistant maize starch as adjuvant therapy was associated with lower levels of f prauznitzii at the time of recovery but did not lead to other changes in the floral pattern. conclusions: specific classes of fecal bacteria are lower  during episodes of acute diarrhea in children than during periods of normal gastrointestinal health, suggesting specific alterations in the flora during diarrhea.

TI  == influence of lamb rennet paste containing probiotic on proteolysis and rheological properties of pecorino cheese.
AB  == pecorino cheeses made from heat-treated ewes' milk using traditional lamb rennet  paste (rp), lamb rennet paste containing lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5; rpl), and lamb rennet paste containing a mix of bifidobacterium lactis (bb-12) and bifidobacterium longum (bb-46; rpb) were characterized for proteolytic and rheological features during ripening. consumer acceptance of cheeses at 60 d of ripening was evaluated. lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium mix displayed counts of 8 log(10) cfu/g and 9 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, in cheese  during ripening. the rpb cheese displayed a greater degradation of casein (cn) matrix carried out by the enzymes associated to both bifidobacterium mix and endogenous lactic acid microflora, resulting in the highest values of non-cn n and water-soluble n and the highest amount of alpha(s)-cn degradation products in cheese at 60 d of ripening. the rpl cheese displayed intermediate levels of lactic acid bacteria and of n fractions. the percentage of gamma-cn in rp and rpl cheeses at 60 d was 2-fold higher than in the cheese curd of the same groups, whereas the mentioned parameter was 3-fold higher in rpb cheese than in the corresponding fresh curd according to its highest plasmin content. the lower hardness in rpb at the end of ripening could be ascribed to the greater proteolysis observed in cheese harboring the bifidobacterium mix. although differences in proteolytic patterns were found among treatments, there were no differences in smell and taste scores.

AB  == this study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab). two strains each of yogurt bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (l. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and l. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (rsm) at 37 degrees c and their proteolytic profiles and ace as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial  3 h of incubation. the growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in ph for the organisms. all the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. the variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ace inhibitory potential of these organisms. bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ace inhibitory potential followed by l. delbrueckii ssp.  bulgaricus 1368, l. casei 15286, s. thermophilus 1275, and l. acidophilus 4461. organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. also, aminopeptidases of strains of l. acidophilus 4461 and s. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ace inhibitory potential. lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.

TI  == effect of versagel on the growth and metabolic activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the influence of a protein-based fat replacer, versagel added at 1% and 2% (w/v) to reconstituted skim milk (rsm), on the growth and metabolic activities of selected strains of yogurt starters (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) as well as probiotic organisms (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum) was  examined. addition of versagel resulted in significantly improved growth of s. thermophilus and b. longum but inhibited that of l. casei, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. this is also reflected in the extent of reduction of ph in rsm with added versagel by these organisms. among the biochemical activities, proteolytic activity of all the organisms except b. longum was adversely affected by the presence of versagel, although the angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) inhibitory and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory activities were improved. versagel at 1% level influenced the growth, while ace inhibitory and alpha-glu inhibitory activities of the organisms were better at 2% level.

TI  == rapid identification of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in probiotic products using multiplex pcr.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract and reinforce immunity in human health. recently, many functional products using the  lactic acid bacteria have been developed. among these lab, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum are frequently used for probiotic products. in order to monitor these lab in commercial probiotic products, a multiplex pcr method was developed. we designed four species-specific primer pairs for multiplex pcr from the 16s rrna,  16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region, and 23s rrna genes in lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum. using these primer pairs, 4 different lab were detected with high specificity in functional foods. we suggest that the multiplex pcr method developed in this study would be an efficient tool for simple, rapid, and reliable identification of lab used as probiotic strains.

TI  == the effect of probiotic fermented milk and inulin on the functions and microecology of the intestine.
AB  == we investigated the effects of a probiotic fermented milk and inulin on gastrointestinal function and microecology. the study was double-blinded and comprised 66 healthy adults (22 male, 44 female), mean age 40 years (range, 22-60 years). after a 12-d baseline period the subjects were randomized to consume, for 3 weeks, 3x200 ml daily of either (1) a fermented milk with probiotics (bifidobacterium longum bb536, bifidobacterium spp. 420 and lactobacillus acidophilus 145), (2) a fermented milk with the same probiotics plus 4 g inulin,  or (3) a control fermented milk. during the last 7 d of the baseline and the intervention periods, the subjects kept a record of their defaecation frequency and gastrointestinal symptoms, and collected all their faeces. intestinal transit time, stool weight and faecal enzyme activities were measured. thirty-nine subjects were randomized to give faecal samples for analysis of ph and microbes,  including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, bacteroides  and clostridium perfringens. consumption of fermented milk with probiotics or with probiotics and inulin increased the faecal number of lactobacilli (p=0.009,  p=0.003) and bifidobacteria (p=0.046, p=0.038) compared with the baseline. compared with the control fermented milk, both active products increased lactobacilli (p=0.005, ancova). subjects consuming fermented milk with probiotics and inulin suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, especially flatulence, more than the others (p<0.001). in conclusion, the probiotic fermented milk product had a positive effect by increasing the number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the colon. inulin did not alter this effect but it increased gastrointestinal  symptoms.

TI  == basic characteristics of sporolactobacillus inulinus bcrc 14647 for potential probiotic properties.
AB  == the basic characteristics of the spore-forming lactic acid bacterium, sporolactobacillus inulinus bcrc 14647, was evaluated in vitro for its potential  probiotic properties. assessments including acid and bile salt tolerance, adhesiveness, and antagonistic effects on pathogenic salmonella enteritidis bcrc  10744, as well as inhibition factors of spent culture supernatant (scs) and an invasion assay, were conducted using lactobacillus acidophilus bcrc 10695 and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium bifidum bcrc 14615 and b. longum bcrc 11847) as a reference. in the results, s. inulinus spores presented significantly higher survival rates than the vegetative cell form in acidic conditions as well as the  reference bifidobacteria. however, l. acidophilus showed the highest viability among all tested strains. similar results were found in the bile tolerance test.  compared with the reference strains, the vegetative cell form of s. inulinus possessed a proper adhesive characteristic (71.7 bacteria/field for s. inulinus and 91.3 and 45.7 bacteria/field for b. bifidum and b. longum, respectively). in  the adhesion assay, both the spore form of s. inulinus (17.1 bacteria/field) and  the negative control, l. bulgaricus bcrc 14009 (5.9 bacteria/field), displayed nonadhesive traits. the vegetative cells of s. inulinus and its scs both dramatically decrease the adhesion of s. enteritidis to caco-2 cells; meanwhile,  the scs of s. inulinus vegetative cells inhibited the growth of s. enteritidis in the inhibition zone test. the existing inhibition factor could be assumed to be lactic acid in the scs. from the results of the invasion assay, s. inulinus showed high safety properties. in conclusion, based on these in vitro evaluations, results suggest that s. inulinus presents probiotic features of great potential in the vegetative cell form.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == short-term soy and probiotic supplementation does not markedly affect concentrations of reproductive hormones in postmenopausal women with and without  histories of breast cancer.
AB  == background: observational studies suggest that dietary isoflavones reduce breast  cancer risk, and this may be caused in part by effects on endogenous hormone concentrations. because intestinal bacteria metabolize isoflavones, it was hypothesized that consumption of probiotic bacteria would enhance the biologic effects of isoflavones, including effects on endogenous hormones. design: twenty  (20) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors and 20 healthy postmenopausal women completed four 42-day diet periods in a randomized, crossover design. they received one of the following: isolated soy protein; isolated milk protein; soy + probiotic capsules; or milk + probiotic capsules. each protein supplement provided 0.38 g protein/(kg body weight/day) (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein/day) and soy protein provided 0.64 mg isoflavones/(kg body weight/day) (44.4 +/- 7.5 mg isoflavones/day). probiotic capsules provided 10(9) colony-forming units lactobacillus acidophilus (strain dds-1), bifidobacterium longum, and 15-20 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. measures: plasma samples were collected at baseline and after each diet for analysis of estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh), androgens, and sex hormone?binding globulin (shbg). results: hormone levels were  not affected by soy, probiotic supplements, or equol producer status, and neither cancer status nor equol producer status altered the effects of soy or probiotics. furthermore probiotics did not alter the effects of soy consumption. soy protein  tended to decrease shbg compared to milk protein diets (p = 0.05), although both  proteins significantly decreased shbg relative to baseline (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.03). conclusions: these data suggest that short-term, moderate consumption of isoflavone-containing soy protein and consumption of these particular probiotic capsules do not significantly alter reproductive hormone concentrations in breast cancer survivors or controls, regardless of equol producer status.

TI  == production of propionibacterium shermanii biomass and vitamin b12 on spent media.
AB  == aims: the propionibacteria are commercially important due to their use in the cheese industry, and there is a growing interest for their probiotic effects. stimulatory effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on propionic acid bacteria have been observed. this study was designed to examine the possibility of using spent  media previously used to grow lab for the production of biomass and metabolites of propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. methods and results: seventeen mrs and vegetable juice media were prefermented by various lab and evaluated for their ability to subsequently support the growth of propionibacterium, using automated spectrophotometry (as). growth of propionibacterium in spent media was strongly affected by the lab strain used to  produce the spent medium. the native mrs medium (not prefermented) yielded the highest optical density values followed by prefermented media by lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum and lactococcus lactis. prefermented cabbage  juice enabled good growth of propionibacterium. for the production of organic acids and vitamin b12, cells of propionibacterium were concentrated and immobilized in alginate beads in the aim of accelerating the bioconversions. more propionic acid was obtained in spent media than in native mrs. the concentration  of vitamin b12 was higher in media fermented with free cells than those with immobilized cultures; with the free cells, its concentration varied from 900 to 1800 ng ml(-1) of media. conclusions: it was demonstrated that spent media could  be recycled for the production of propionibacterium and metabolites, depending on the lab strain that was previously grown. media remediation is needed to improve  the production of vitamin b12, especially with immobilized cells. significance and impact of the study: this study presents an option for recycling of spent media generated by producers of lab or producers of fermented vegetables. the propionic fermentation may result in three commercial products: biomass, vitamin  b12 or organic acids, which may be used as starters, supplements or food preservatives. it is an attractive process from economical and environmental standpoints.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == one hundred and twenty-two strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species have been tested against 12 antibiotics and two antibiotic mixtures by a commercial system (sensititre anaero3; treck diagnostic systems). the upper limits of some minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were completed on mrs agar plates by the nccls procedure. all strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol and imipenem and most of the strains were resistant to metronidazole. bifidobacteria isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin, whereas about half of the  lactobacilli were resistant. approximately 30% of the bifidobacterium isolates were resistant to tetracycline, as well as five lactobacillus strains belonging to four different species. none of the tested bifidobacterium isolates was resistant to vancomycin, whereas a species-dependent resistance was found among the lactobacilli. single strains of bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus brevis were resistant to erythromycin and/or clindamycin. most of the observed resistances seemed to be intrinsic, but some others could be compatible with transmissible determinants.

TI  == hepatoprotective effect of lactic acid bacteria, inhibitors of beta-glucuronidase production against intestinal microflora.
AB  == the hepatoprotective activity of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus brevis hy7401, lactobacillus acidophilus csg and bifidobacterium longum hy8001), which inhibited beta-glucuronidase productivity of intestinal microflora, on t-bhp- or  ccl4-induced hepatotoxicity of mice were evaluated. these oral administration of  lactic acid bacteria lowered beta-glucuronidase production of intestinal microflora as well as escherichia coli hgu-3. when lactic acid bacteria at a dose of 0.5 or 2 g (wet weight)/kg was orally administered on ccl4-induced liver injury in mice, these bacteria significantly inhibited the increase of plasma alanine transferase and aspartate transferase activities by 17-57% and 57-66% of  the ccl4 control group, respectively. these lactic acid bacteria also showed the  potent hepatoprotective effect against t-bhp-induced liver injury in mice. the inhibitory effects of these lactic acid bacteria were more potent than that of dimethyl diphenyl bicarboxylate (ddb), which have been used as a commercial hepatoprotective agent. among these lactic acid bacteria, l. acidophilus csg exhibited the most potent hepatoprotective effect. based on these findings, we insist that an inhibitor of beta-glucuronidase production in intestine, such as lactic acid bacteria, may be hepatoprotective.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == the effect of soy consumption on the urinary 2:16-hydroxyestrone ratio in postmenopausal women depends on equol production status but is not influenced by  probiotic consumption.
AB  == some epidemiologic studies reported an association between a low ratio of urinary 2-hydroxyestrogens (2-hydroxyestradiol + 2-hydroxyestrone) to 16alpha-hydroxyestrone (2:16ohe(1)) and increased breast cancer risk. some studies show that soy consumption increases this ratio, and it is suggested that  this effect may reduce breast cancer risk. we hypothesized that consumption of probiotic bacteria would alter fecal bacteria and enzymes involved in soy isoflavone metabolism, thereby increasing isoflavone bioavailability and enhancing the beneficial effects of soy on estrogen metabolism. breast cancer survivors (n = 20) and controls (n = 20) were given 4 treatments for 6 wk each, separated by 2-wk washout periods, in a randomized, crossover design: soy protein (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein/d containing 44.4 +/- 7.5 mg isoflavones/d); soy protein  + probiotics (10(9) colony-forming units lactobacillus acidophilus dds(r)+1 & bifidobacterium longum, 15-30 mg fructooligosaccharide/d); milk protein (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein/d); and milk protein + probiotics. survivors tended to have a lower baseline urine 2:16ohe(1) ratio than controls (p = 0.10). in the group as a whole, soy consumption tended to increase urinary 2-hydroxyestrogens (p = 0.07) and 16alpha-hydroxyestrone (p = 0.11) but had no effect on the urinary 2:16ohe(1) ratio. when subjects were divided into groups by plasma concentrations and urinary levels of the daidzein metabolite equol, soy increased urinary 2-hydroxyestrogens (p = 0.01) and the 2:16ohe(1) ratio (p = 0.04) only in subjects with high plasma equol concentrations. none of these results were influenced by probiotic consumption. these results are consistent with studies that found lower urine 2:16ohe(1) ratios in women with breast cancer and suggest  that soy consumption increases this ratio only in women who are equol producers.

TI  == probiotic consumption does not enhance the cholesterol-lowering effect of soy in  postmenopausal women.
AB  == numerous studies report that soy lowers cholesterol. probiotic bacteria were also reported to lower total cholesterol (tc) and ldl cholesterol (ldl-c). we hypothesized that by altering intestinal microflora, probiotic consumption may also change phytoestrogen metabolism and enhance the effects of soy. to evaluate  the independent and interactive effects of probiotic bacteria and soy on plasma tc, ldl-c, hdl cholesterol (hdl-c), and triglycerides (tg), 37 women with a baseline tc of 5.24 mmol/l were given the following 4 treatments for 6 wk each in a randomized crossover design: soy protein isolate (26 +/- 5 g soy protein containing 44 +/- 8 mg isoflavones/d); soy protein isolate + probiotic capsules (10(9) colony-forming units lactobacillus acidophilus dds-1 and bifidobacterium longum); milk protein isolate (26 +/- 5 g milk protein/d); and milk protein isolate + probiotic. soy consumption decreased plasma tc by 2.2% (p = 0.02) and ldl-c by 3.5% (p = 0.005), increased hdl-c by 4.2% (p = 0.006) and tended to decrease tg (p = 0.07) compared with milk protein intake. when divided according  to initial tc concentration, soy effects were observed only in hypercholesterolemic women (tc > 5.17 mmol/l). in this subgroup, soy treatments decreased plasma tc by 3.3% (p = 0.01), ldl-c by 4.5% (p = 0.004), and tg by 10.6% (p = 0.02), and increased hdl-c by 4.2% (p = 0.02). when subjects were divided on the basis of plasma and urine concentrations of the isoflavone metabolite, equol, equol producers and nonproducers did not differ in baseline lipids or in the effects of soy. probiotics did not lower cholesterol or enhance  the effects of soy. these results confirm a beneficial effect of soy on plasma cholesterol in mildly hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women independent of equol production status, but do not support an independent or additive effect of  these particular probiotic bacteria.

TI  == plasma phytoestrogens are not altered by probiotic consumption in postmenopausal  women with and without a history of breast cancer.
AB  == soy phytoestrogens were suggested to reduce the risk of a number of diseases including breast cancer. given that these compounds are metabolized by bacteria,  alteration of intestinal bacteria and enzymes may affect phytoestrogen metabolism. we hypothesized that probiotics, when consumed with soy protein, would increase plasma isoflavones, as well as equol producer frequency, in postmenopausal women. we further hypothesized that these effects would differ between women who have had breast cancer and women who have not. to test these hypotheses, 20 breast cancer survivors and 20 controls completed four 6-wk treatments in a randomized, crossover design: supplementation with soy protein (s) (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein, 44.4 +/- 7.5 mg isoflavones/d); soy + probiotics (s+p) (10(9) colony-forming units lactobacillus acidophilus dds+1 and bifidobacterium longum, 15-30 mg fructooligosaccharide/d); milk protein (m) (26.6 +/- 4.5 g protein/d); and milk + probiotics (m+p). plasma phytoestrogen concentrations did not differ between controls and survivors, although genistein  tended to be lower in survivors at baseline (p = 0.15), and during soy (p = 0.16) and milk protein (p = 0.16) consumption. as expected, soy consumption increased plasma phytoestrogen concentrations (p < 0.0001). plasma phytoestrogen concentrations and the number of equol producers did not differ between the s and s+p diets. at the same time, plasma equol concentrations as well as urinary equol excretion in 2 subjects were more than 7-fold different between the 2 diets. these results indicate that this particular probiotic supplement does not generally affect plasma isoflavones, although the large differences between plasma and urinary equol in some subjects suggest that equol producer status may  be modifiable in some individuals.

TI  == growth-promoting effects of lactoferrin on l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp.
AB  == we investigated the effects of lactoferrin on the growth of l. acidophilus ch-2,  bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, b. longum atcc 15707, b. infantis atcc 15697, and b. bifidum atcc 15696. the growth of l. acidophilus was stimulated by bovine  holo-lactoferrin but not by apo-lactoferrin. with bifidobacteria, bovine lactoferrin stimulated growth of three strains: b. breve, b. infantis and b. bifidum under certain conditions. both apoprotein and holoprotein had similar effects. however, b. longum growth was not affected by lactoferrin. thus, the mechanism of stimulating growth of bifidobacteria may be different from that of l. acidophilus. by far-western blotting using biotinylated lactoferrin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, lactoferrin-binding proteins were detected in the membrane protein fraction of l. acidophilus, b. bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve. the molecular weights of lactoferrin-binding proteins of l. acidophilus were estimated from sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 27, 41 and 67 kda, and those of the three bifidobacterial strains were estimated  to be 67-69 kda. however, no such lactoferrin-binding components were detected in the membrane fraction of b. longum. it is interesting that the appearance of lactoferrin-binding proteins in the membrane fraction of these species corresponds to their growth stimulation by lactoferrin.

TI  == consumption of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum do not alter  urinary equol excretion and plasma reproductive hormones in premenopausal women.
AB  == objective: to confirm the results of an earlier study showing premenopausal equol excretors to have hormone profiles associated with reduced breast cancer risk, and to investigate whether equol excretion status and plasma hormone concentrations can be influenced by consumption of probiotics. design: a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial. subjects: in  all, 34 of the initially enrolled 37 subjects completed all requirements. intervention: all subjects were followed for two full menstrual cycles and the first seven days of a third cycle. during menstrual cycle 1, plasma concentrations of estradiol (e(2)), estrone (e(1)), estrone-sulfate (e(1)-s), testosterone (t), androstenedione (a), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (dhea-s), and sex-hormone-binding globulin (shbg) were measured on cycle day 2, 3, or 4, and urinary equol measured on day 7 after a 4-day soy challenge. subjects then received either probiotic capsules (containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum) or placebo capsules through day 7 of menstrual cycle 3, at which time both the plasma hormone concentrations and the post-soy challenge urinary equol measurements were repeated. results: during menstrual cycle 1, equol excretors and non-excretors were not significantly different with respect to subject characteristics, diet, or hormone concentrations. significant inverse  correlations were found between e(2) and body mass index (bmi) (p=0.02), shbg and bmi (p=0.01), dhea-s and dietary fiber (p=0.04), and a and protein:carbohydrate ratio (p=0.02). probiotic consumption failed to significantly alter equol excretor status or hormone concentrations during menstrual cycle 3, although there were trends towards decreased concentrations of t (p=0.14) and shbg (p=0.10) in the probiotic group. conclusions: we were unable to verify a previously reported finding of premenopausal equol excretors having plasma hormone concentrations different from those of nonexcretors. furthermore, a 2-month intervention with probiotic capsules did not significantly alter equol excretion or plasma hormone concentrations.

TI  == dietary intervention with the probiotics lactobacillus acidophilus 145 and bifidobacterium longum 913 modulates the potential of human faecal water to induce damage in ht29clone19a cells.
AB  == probiotics reduce the risk of colon cancer by inhibiting carcinogen-induced dna damage in animals, but there are no analogous data in human subjects. to enhance  knowledge of the effects of probiotics in human subjects, we have investigated the genotoxicity of faecal water after dietary intervention with standard yoghurt or with probiotic yoghurt, which included the strains lactobacillus acidophilus 145 and bifidobacterium longum 913. faeces were collected from nine healthy volunteers after intervention with probiotic yoghurt or standard yoghurt. faecal  water was isolated and incubated with human colon tumour cells ht29clone19a. dna  strand breaks, oxidised dna bases and damage after challenge with h2o2 were determined by micro-gel-electrophoresis. faecal water was genotoxic in comparison with nacl, but protected against h2o2-induced dna strand breaks. the intervention with probiotic yoghurt significantly lowered faecal water genotoxicity compared with standard yoghurt. however, probiotic intervention also increased oxidative damage; this either reflected prooxidative activity or stimulation of endogenous  defence systems. altogether, the balance of effects favoured protection, since faecal water from the probiotic group reduced overall genetic damage. thus, there was a reduction of strand break-inducing compounds in human faeces after dietary  intervention with probiotic bacteria. this protection reflected results from previous studies in carcinogen-exposed animals where probiotics reduced dna damage in colon cells.

AB  == to develop a probiotic dietary adjunct, soymilk fermented with various combinations of lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium infantis) was subjected to freeze-drying and spray-drying. survival of the starter organisms during the drying process, subsequent rehydration at different temperatures and during a 4-month period of storage under different storage conditions was examined. after freeze-drying, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria exhibited a survival percent of 46.2-75.1% and 43.2-51.9%, respectively, higher than that noted after spray-drying. regardless of the drying condition, s. thermophilus showed a higher percentage of survival than l. acidophilus, while b. longum survived better than b. infantis. further study with soymilk fermented with s. thermophilus and b. longum revealed that the freeze-dried and spray-dried fermented soymilk rehydrated at 35-50 degrees c and  20 degrees c, respectively, was optimum for the recovery of the starter organisms. both s. thermophilus and b. longum survived better in the freeze-dried than the spray-dried fermented soymilk during storage. a higher percent of survival was also noted for both the starter organisms when the dried fermented soymilk was stored at 4 degrees c than 25 degrees c. holding the dried fermented  soymilk in the laminated pouch enabled s. thermophilus and b. longum to exhibit a higher percentage of survival than in the deoxidant- and desiccant-containing glass or polyester (pet) bottle. among all the packaging materials and storage temperatures tested, starter organisms were most stable in the dried fermented soymilk held in laminated pouch and stored at 4 degrees c. under this storage condition, s. thermophilus and b. longum showed a survival percentage of 51.1% and 68.8%, respectively, in the freeze-dried fermented soymilk after 4 months of  storage. meanwhile, s. thermophilus and b. infantis in the spray-dried fermented  soymilk showed a survival percent of 29.5% and 57.7%, respectively.

TI  == the role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == literature reporting activity of probiotics in infections due to helicobacter pylori has been reviewed to assess their value in combating such infections. several in vitro studies show that lactobacilli or their cell-free cultures inhibit or kill h. pylori, prevent its adhesion to mammalian epithelial cells and prevent il8 release. in vivo models demonstrate that pre-treatment with a probiotic can prevent h. pylori infections and/or that administration of probiotics markedly reduced an existing infection. thirteen clinical trials have  been published. in six (180 patients), a probiotic was used alone; five of these  had an encouraging result-in three there were significantly reduced breath test readings and in two others some patients were cleared of infection. in seven further trials (682 patients), probiotics were added to a therapeutic regimen of  antibiotics, resulting in an increased cure rate in two studies, and reduced side-effects in four. trials in which fermented milk products or whole cultures of lactobacilli were used tended to show better results than when the probiotic was taken in the form of bacteria alone. not all the studies were randomised, double-blind and placebo controlled, and some involved only small numbers of patients. the results suggest that probiotics may have a place as adjunctive treatment in h. pylori infections and possibly in prophylaxis. future trials should address in particular the type of patient (asymptomatic volunteers, symptomatic patients), choice of probiotic strain(s), a wide range of probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium longum, and bioyoghurts) have been used-some non-viable, regimens (doses and duration) and criteria of success (breath test, histology, culture, serology).

AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and  lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448).  in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over  the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.

TI  == effect of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and inulin on the formation of aberrant crypt foci in rats.
AB  == background: our studies were aimed at investigating the effect of lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) or inulin, a natural source of non-digestible oligosaccharides derived from chicory, on the induction by carcinogens of aberrant crypt foci (acf) in the colon, which are considered to be early precursor lesions of neoplasia. methods: strains of bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were administered to rats fed a purified high starch diet, under a variety of treatment protocols including daily gavage, via the drinking water and in the diet. the rats were treated with methyl-n-nitrosourea, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, or azoxymethane (aom) to induce acf. results: in general, no consistent significant changes in acf numbers were detected in these experiments. in one study, the basal diet of the rats was changed to one containing a higher level of fat (corn oil). under these conditions, a significant decrease in aom-induced colonic acf was seen in rats given l. acidophilus or inulin. in a concurrent group of animals fed a low fat diet, no significant decrease in acf was observed. conclusions: the results indicate that the type of diet fed can influence the detection of protective effects of lab and oligosaccharides and that against the background of a diet with a level of fat typical of a western diet, evidence for a protective effect of l. acidophilus and inulin towards colon cancer was obtained

TI  == effects of lactic acid bacteria on the uptake and distribution of the food mutagen trp-p-2 in mice.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties in vivo and in vitro. lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum have earlier been shown to bind the food mutagen trp-p-2 in vitro. methods: the influence of oral supplementation with l. acidophilus ncfb 1748 and b. longum bb 536 on the uptake and distribution of 14c-labelled trp-p-2  in several mouse tissues was quantified by liquid scintillation measurements and  examined by tape section autoradiography (gives an unbiased qualitative registration of differences in overall tissue distribution) in the present investigation. furthermore, the effect of 13-naphthoflavone (bnf), a cytochrome p4501a (cyp1a)-inducing agent, on the distribution of 14c-labelled trp-p-2 was examined. results: after oral (6 mg/kg; 5 microci) or iv (1.2 mg/kg; 1 microci) administration of 14c-labelled trp-p-2, high levels of radioactivity were observed in the bile, urine and contents of the gastrointestinal tract. lower levels were present in the liver, lung, kidney, intestines, brown fat, submaxillary salivary gland and thymus. in mice supplemented with lactic acid bacteria there was a significantly decreased level (29%-73%) of radioactivity in  the lung, thymus, liver, kidney, submaxillary salivary gland and small intestine  as compared with controls. in mice pretreated with bnf, a low but distinct localization of radioactivity in the lung was observed, whereas no similar localization occurred in controls. conclusions: the results suggest that (i) there is a decreased bioavailability of the trp-p-2 in the majority of the tissues examined in bacteria supplemented mice and (ii) there is a low but distinct cyp1a-dependent activation of trp-p-2 in the lung of bnf-treated mice.

TI  == selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
AB  == among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an  impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity  against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak  or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis,  b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.

TI  == probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. the incidence of aad differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. the major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all aad. in most cases of aad discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower aad risk can be effective. for more severe cases involving c. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. another approach to aad treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of aad such as selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus faecium. another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii has been used. in animal models of  c. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with s. boulardii  (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in c. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin b production. in several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), s. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of c. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins a and b of c. difficile. it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of c. difficile colitis. a good response has been seen in children with aad, treated by s. boulardii only. in icus prevention of aad remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of c. difficile or other agents of aad should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). in addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as s. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. aad in at risk patients.

AB  == nineteen strains of lactic acid bacteria were investigated for antioxidative activity. these includedlactobacillus acidophilus b, e, n1, 4356, la-1, and farr; lactobacillus bulgaricus 12 278, 448, 449, lb, 1006, and 11 842; streptococcus thermophilus 821, mc, 573, 3641, and 19 987; and bifidobacterium longum b6 and 15 708. intracellular cell-free extract of all strains demonstrated antioxidative activity with inhibition rates of ascorbate autoxidation in the range of 7-12%. antioxidative mechanisms including metal ion chelating ability, scavenge of reactive oxygen species, enzyme inhibition, and reducing activity of intracellular cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria were studied. s. thermophilus 821 had the highest metal ion chelating ability for fe(2+), and b. longum 15 708 showed the highest cu(2+) chelating ability among the 19 strains tested. all strains demonstrated reactive oxygen species scavenging ability. l. acidophilus e showed the highest hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, and b. longum b6 had the best hydrogen peroxide scavenging ability. reducing activity was also found in all strains. most of the strains tested demonstrated excellent  reducing activity. b. longum b6 showed the highest reducing activity among the 19 strains tested. in enzyme inhibition, superoxide dismutase activity was not found in these 19 strains, and the activity of superoxide dismutase was not induced when metal ion mn(2+), fe(2+), or cu(2+)zn(2+) was present.

TI  == effects of intestinal bacteria on the development of colonic neoplasm: an experimental study.
AB  == effects of intestinal microflora on the development of colonic neoplasm induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) were observed using conventionalized and gnotobiotic mouse models. the incidence of colonic adenoma in germ-free mice (iqi/jic) (gf), mice conventionalized after dmh injection (cvz-post-dmh) and conventionalized mice (cvz, conventionalized before dmh injection) was 74%, 69% and 58%, respectively. the mean number of adenomas per mouse in the three groups  was 2.6, 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. however, the adenoma in cvz was larger than in gf. the incidence of adenoma in mice mono-associated with mitsuokella multiacida, clostridium butyricum, bifidobacterium longum, clostridium paraputrificum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus acidophilus was 68%, 68%, 63%, 50%, 50% and 30%, respectively. however, the adenoma in the cl. paraputrificum group and the cl. butyricum group was larger than in gf. faecal ph in cvz and the l. acidophilus group was significantly lower than in gf. the deconjugation rate of faecal bile acids in cvz, the cl. paraputrificum group and the cl. butyricum group was significantly higher than in gf. these findings suggested two different effects of microflora on the development of dmh-induced adenoma: either an inhibition of the incidence of adenoma or a promotion of tumour growth. effects of l. acidophilus may be mediated by faecal ph and effects of cl. paraputrificum  and cl. butyricum by deconjugated bile acids.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == increased growth of bifidobacterium and eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  == germinated barley foodstuff (gbf) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. gbf improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (scfa), especially butyrate. in this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. daily administration of 9 g gbf for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. fecal bifidobacterium and eubacterium were also significantly increased by gbf administration in healthy volunteers. ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing gbf as a sole carbon source (gbf medium). after a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, bacteroides ovatus, clostridium butyricum, and  eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium ph producing scfa. eubacterium grown together with bifidobacterium in gbf medium efficiently produced butyrate. on the other hand, gbf changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. as a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of eubacterium and bifidobacterium. this butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == antimutagenicity and the influence of physical factors in binding lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum cells to amino acid pyrolysates.
AB  == antimutagenic and binding properties of 28 strains of lactobacillus gasseri and 2 strains of bifidobacterium longum on the mutagenicity of amino acid pyrolysates were investigated in vitro using a streptomycin-dependent (sd510) strain of salmonella typhimurium ta 98. four strains of l. acidophilus (sbt0274, sbt1703, sbt10239, and sbt10241) and 1 strain of b. longum (sbt 2928) exhibited the highest percentage of antimutagenicity and binding. these 5 strains were further  optimized for other physical factors influencing the mechanism of binding, such as cell and mutagen concentration, ph, and incubation time. in all of the selected strains, 2 mg of cells bound with 88 to 95% of 0.2 mg of 3-amino-1,4 dimethyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole in 30 min at ph 7.0. other amino acid pyrolysates, such as 3-amino-1-methyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole, 2-amino-6-methyldi-pyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole, 2-amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5,f]quinoline, and 2-amino-3,4-dimethyl-imidazo[4,5,f]quinoline were also tested for the binding ability of these strains. we observed that the complexity of the mutagens greatly influenced the binding properties. the binding of 3-amino-1,4 dimethyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole to the purified cell walls was very high compared with that of the crude cell wall, peptidoglycan, or the cell extract. binding was inhibited when the cell walls were subjected to treatment with metaperiodate or trichloroacetic acid but not when they were subjected to treatment with lysozyme, trypsin, or proteinase k, reflecting the role of the carbohydrate component as a  binding site.

TI  == influence of carcinogen binding by lactic acid-producing bacteria on tissue distribution and in vivo mutagenicity of dietary carcinogens.
AB  == the aims of this investigation were to determine whether viable cultures of lactic acid-producing organisms (lab) can bind dietary carcinogens and to assess  the consequences of binding for the absorption from the gut, distribution in the  body and in vivo genotoxicity of ingested carcinogens. the carcinogens used in this study were ones known to be present in the human diet, namely benzo[a]pyrene (b(a)p, aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and the cooked food carcinogens 2-amino-3-methyl-3h-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (iq), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (meiq), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (meiqx), 5-phenyl-2-amino-1-methylimidazo [4,5-f]pyridine (phip) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5h-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (trp-p-2). they represent a range of structural types so that the specificity of any binding effects could be addressed. of the carcinogens tested, b(a)p and trp-p-2 were bound most effectively by the two lab strains bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus. afb1 was poorly bound, while meiqx, meiq, phip and iq were bound to  an intermediate degree. the extent of the binding of the heterocyclic amine carcinogens was dependent on the ph conditions during incubation and this effect  was more apparent with b. longum than with l. acidophilus. using the host-mediated assay (hma), an in vivo bacterial mutation assay, it was demonstrated that the administration of bacterial cell suspensions of b. longum and l. acidophilus did not lead to a reduction in induced mutagenicity by meiq, meiqx or trp-p-2, detectable in the liver of treated mice compared with controls. the lack of a protective effect could not be attributed to a short period of contact between bacterial cells and mutagens, since similar results were obtained after preincubating bacteria and mutagens together at ph 5 for 50-60 min, to maximize the binding, before gavaging the mice. lack of activity of b(a)p in the  hma prevented the determination of the effect of lab on genotoxicity of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. however, it is clear from the radiolabel distribution study that the amount of the carcinogen entering the blood was not significantly reduced by b. longum administration. in addition, the amount of radiolabelled b(a)p that reached the target organs (liver, lungs and heart) was also not affected by the lab administration. a similar lack of inhibitory effect  of b. longum on blood concentration and accumulation in the liver of trp-p-2 was  apparent. the results of the present study suggest that although lab may bind carcinogens in vitro, this does not lead to major changes in absorption and distribution of carcinogens in the body, or in their genotoxic activity in the liver.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

TI  == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

AB  == a double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of enterococcus faecium and bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of lactobacillus acidophilus, bif. bifidum, lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. however, the test preparation containing ent. faecium and bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (p = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (p < 0.02). this study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.

TI  == augmentation of macrophage phagocytic activity by cell-free extracts of selected  lactic acid-producing bacteria.
AB  == oral and intraperitoneal administration of lactic acid-producing bacteria can significantly augment the immune response in murine models; however, the immunopotentiating effects in these studies differ significantly. murine macrophagelike cell line j774 was cultured in the presence of cell-free extracts  of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum, and the effect on macrophage function was evaluated by measurement of synthesis of selected enzymes and their ability to take up either acrylamide particles or live salmonella typhimurium. lysozyme activity of j774 cells was significantly decreased by cell-free extracts of b. longum, but not of l. acidophilus, whereas extracts of both strains induced morphological changes and significantly enhanced phagocytosis of inert particles or viable salmonella. whole cell extracts of lactic acid-producing bacteria are therefore capable of altering macrophage function in a strain-dependent manner.

TI  == inhibitory effect of some intestinal bacteria on liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
AB  == liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice was markedly promoted by association with a bacterial combination of escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and clostridium paraputrificum. this study demonstrated that this promoting effect was suppressed by addition of certain intestinal bacteria, such  as bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and eubacterium rectale.
