TI  == in vitro activity of biapenem plus rpx7009, a carbapenem combined with a serine beta-lactamase inhibitor, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == biapenem is a carbapenem being developed in combination with rpx7009, a new inhibitor of serine beta-lactamases. biapenem was tested alone and in combination with fixed concentrations of rpx7009 by agar dilution against 377 recent isolates of anaerobes. a separate panel of 27 isolates of bacteroides spp. with decreased  susceptibility or resistance to imipenem was also tested. comparator drugs included meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, clindamycin, and tigecycline plus imipenem, doripenem, and ertapenem for the 27 selected strains. for recent consecutive strains of bacteroides species, the mic(90) for biapenem-rpx7009 was 1 mug/ml, with a mic(90) of 4 mug/ml for meropenem. other bacteroides fragilis group species showed a mic90 of 0.5 mug/ml for both agents. the mic(90)s for biapenem-rpx7009 were 0.25 mug/ml for prevotella spp., 0.125 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and fusobacterium necrophorum, 2 mug/ml for fusobacterium mortiferum, 0.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium varium, </= 0.5 mug/ml for gram-positive cocci and rods, and 0.03 to 8 mug/ml for clostridia. against 5 b. fragilis strains harboring a known metallo-beta-lactamase, biapenem-rpx7009 mics were comparable to those of other carbapenems (>/= 32 mug/ml). against bacteroides strains with an imipenem mic of 2 mug/ml, biapenem-rpx7009 had mics of 0.5 to 2 mug/ml, with mics of 0.5 to 32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. for strains with an imipenem mic of 4 mug/ml, the mics for biapenem-rpx7009 were  4 to 16 mug/ml, with mics of 8 to >32 mug/ml for meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem. the inhibitor rpx7009 had no antimicrobial activity when tested alone, and it showed little or no potentiation of biapenem versus anaerobes. biapenem-rpx7009 showed activity comparable to that of imipenem and was superior  to meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem against imipenem-nonsusceptible bacteroides spp.

TI  == identification of a 43-kda outer membrane protein of fusobacterium necrophorum that exhibits similarity with pore-forming proteins of other fusobacterium species.
AB  == a pair of primers was designed in an attempt to amplify outer membrane protein (omp) gene of fusobacterium necrophorum based on nucleotide sequence of the omp of fusobacterium nucleatum. further analysis was performed to characterize its molecular properties and phylogeny in the genus fusobacterium. we identified a predicated 43kda outer membrane protein (43k omp) in f. necrophorum, which showed the same properties as other pore-forming proteins of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria according to analysis of signal peptide, at-rich, membrane-spanning region and conserved motifs. the predicated 43k omp exhibited 70.22%, 62.04%, 56.75%, 58.72%, 51.59%, 31.49% and 50.26% amino acid identity with the omps of f. nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, fusobacterium ucerans, fusobacterium periodonticum, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and f. necrophorum (hypothetical protein), respectively. 11 common conserved domains and 10 common variable domains were found among the 45 aligned omps of fusobacterium  species. distributions of the conserved and variable domains were highly associated with predicted membrane-spanning regions, cell surface exposed regions and b-cell epitope regions. phylogenetic analysis revealed the predicated 43k omp of f. necrophorum was closely related with the omps from f. nucleatum and f. periodonticum. these data will increase understanding of pathogenesis and genetic evolution of f. necrophorum.

TI  == lemierre's syndrome, reemergence of a forgotten disease: a case report.
AB  == lemierre's syndrome is a rare disorder of young adults caused by the anaerobic bacterium, fusobacterium necrophorum and occasionally by other fusobacterium species (f. nucleatum, f. mortiferum and f. varium etc). the condition is characterized by a primary oropharyngeal infection with evidence of septic thrombophlebitis, exhibited by positive blood cultures, clinical or radiographic  evidence of internal jugular vein thrombosis, and at least one metastatic focus.  the incidence of lemierre's syndrome is reported to be nearly one in a million. in the pre-antibiotic era, lemierre's syndrome followed a fulminant, often fatal  course. during the 1960s and 1970s, the syndrome was rarely reported when penicillin was commonly prescribed to treat oropharyngeal infections. today, antibiotic-resistant organisms are a major concern, thus causing more prudent prescribing of antibiotics. we present a case report of a 27-year-old man with worsening pharyngitis, which illustrates that subsequent reemergence of this often forgotten disease may become more common in clinical setting.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against clinical isolates of fusobacterium spp.
AB  == objectives: although most susceptibility studies for linezolid have investigated  aerobic bacteria, only a few have investigated anaerobe isolates. the aim of the  present study was to determine the antibacterial activity of linezolid against a  larger sample of clinical isolates of fusobacterium spp. and to report on the detailed susceptibility, stratified by species. methods: the in vitro susceptibility of 80 clinical isolates of fusobacterium (fusobacterium necrophorum, n = 34; fusobacterium nucleatum, n = 20; fusobacterium varium, n = 18; fusobacterium mortiferum; n = 8) was tested and compared with the activity of the older compounds amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. results: the mic of linezolid ranged from 0.016 to 1.0 mg/l, with the mic(90) being 0.5 mg/l. the  highest mic obtained for linezolid (1.0 mg/l) was measured for an f. varium isolate. the mic(90) for both, amoxicillin (range: 0.016-0.75 mg/l) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range: 0.047-0.75 mg/l), was 0.5 mg/l. overall, no resistant strains were found in the study. conclusions: compared with amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid was less active against f. necrophorum (mic(90) 0.25 mg/l) and f. nucleatum (mic(90) 0.25 mg/l), equally active against  f. varium (mic(90) 0.75 mg/l) and slightly more active against f. mortiferum (mic(90) 0.19 mg/l).

TI  == in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == by using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of clostridium difficile for which mics of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid mics were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. nineteen clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin mic at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. all strains of eubacterium, actinomyces, propionibacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the prevotella and porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin mics for all 31 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group, the fusobacterium mortiferum-fusobacterium varium group, and veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. ramoplanin displays excellent activity against c. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.

TI  == activities of garenoxacin (bms-284756) and other agents against anaerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == a total of 590 clinical isolates consisting of 33 species of both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes were collected from nine centers in the chicago area  in 1998-1999. the largest number of isolates (330 isolates, 56%) belonged to the  bacteroides group. isolates were tested by agar dilution against garenoxacin (bms-284756, t-3811 me), trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefoxitin. all but one species (2% of bacteroides vulgatus isolates) were fully susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. a number of species were resistant to clindamycin. among the fluoroquinolones, garenoxacin and trovafloxacin had an mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited of <4 micro g/ml for all but two species (fusobacterium mortiferum/varium and peptostreptococcus anaerobius).

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == update on the taxonomy and clinical aspects of the genus fusobacterium.
AB  == the genus fusobacterium currently includes 13 species. fusobacterium nucleatum, the most frequently encountered species in humans, is heterogeneous and currently includes 5 subspecies. a potentially new subspecies of f. nucleatum that is intrinsically quinolone-resistant and phylogenetically separate from the other 5  subspecies has been identified from dog and cat oral flora. two subspecies have been described for fusobacterium necrophorum, and a new species, fusobacterium equinum, which is related to f. necrophorum, has been described from horse oral flora. additional molecular studies have characterized fusobacterium ulcerans as  separate from the phenotypically similar fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium. fusobacterium sulci and fusobacterium alocis have been reclassified as eubacterium sulci and filifactor alocis, respectively. fusobacterium prausnitzii is phylogenetically related to the eubacterium-like organisms and will likely be reclassified in the future. the status of the remaining species is unchanged.

TI  == 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus fusobacterium.
AB  == the 16s-23s rdna internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of all currently defined fusobacterium species and related taxa such as leptotrichia buccalis, sebaldella termitidis and streptobacillus moniliformans, were analysed to examine inter- and intraspecies as well as subspecies relationships. for the its-amplification, a new eubacterial universal primer pair was designed and used. the majority of the fusobacterium strains, along with l. buccalis showed one major, and two to three weaker, distinct bands (short and long versions) with lengths of 800-830 bp and 1000-1100 bp. nevertheless, six other patterns were also found within the genus fusobacterium, demonstrating its heterogeneity. the its region was sequenced and found to consist both of conserved motifs, which functioned as a framework for alignment, and of variable sites, which provided high phylogenetic resolution. analyses of the its-dna sequences and its relative  length (short version) allowed species and subspecies differentiation in most cases. the results confirmed the strikingly distant relationship between fusobacterium prausnitzii and the genus fusobacterium. fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, along with fusobacterium naviforme, fusobacterium simiae and fusobacterium periodonticum, formed a cluster with an inherently high potential for diversification. other clusters were formed by fusobacterium necrophorum subspecies with fusobacterium gonidaformans and by fusobacterium varium with fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium ulcerans. fusobacterium russii as well as fusobacterium perfoetens formed separate branches. fusobacterium necrophorum subspp. necrophorum and funduliforme on the one hand, and fusobacterium varium and fusobacterium mortiferum on the other, were found to be very similar, even at the high-resolution its level.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).

TI  == subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in  the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. subgingival paper point samples were  taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group a) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group b) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. there was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group a and group b in morphotypes of the different microflora. the predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: gemella, peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus, stomatococcus, streptococcus, actinomyces, eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, neisseria, veillonella, bacteroides, campylobacter, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, kingella, porphyromonas and prevotella species. there was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of kingella dentrificans isolated from group b sites. however, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (peptostreptococcus  prevotii and propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (eubacterium aerofaciens, fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium) was detected. these findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to  that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.

TI  == conversion of dl-threonine, d-threonine and 2-oxobutyrate into propionate and 2-hydroxybutyrate by fusobacterium species.
AB  == the present investigation examined dl-threonine, d-threonine and 2-oxobutyrate conversion into propionate and 2-hydroxybutyrate by various type strains and clinical isolates of fusobacterium. except for fus. naviforme, the type strains were able to produce varying degrees of propionate and/or 2-hydroxybutyrate from  dl-threonine. additionally, d-threonine was converted into an equimolar amount of propionate by fus. necrophorum subsp. necrophorum, fus. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum and fus. varium, and to a lower but significant amount by fus. mortiferum and fus. perfoetens. however, the level of propionate remained unchanged for fus. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme, fus. nucleatum subsp. vincentii, fus. naviforme, fus. necrophorum subsp. funduliforme, fus. gonidiaforme and fus.  russii. 2-oxobutyrate was fermented to propionate by all type strains, although fus. russii reduced it mainly to 2-hydroxybutyrate. thus, an attempt was made to  make use of these features in order to identify clinical isolates.

AB  == the activity of a new quinolone agent, du-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards-approved wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of du-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin,  metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. du-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every  group of organisms. mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis (57), other b. fragilis group species (84), bilophila wadsworthia (15), clostridium species (27) (including c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum), fusobacterium nucleatum (16), fusobacterium mortiferum-f. varium group species (10), peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and prevotella species (25).

TI  == inactivation of anaerobic bacteria by various photosensitized porphyrins or by hemin.
AB  == the photodynamic effects of deuteroporphyrin (dp), hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd), hematoporphyrin (hp), or protoporphyrin (pp) on a variety of anaerobic microorganisms were examined in this study. the majority of the species, among the 350 strains tested, were inhibited by concentrations of < or = 2.5 micrograms/ml of light-activated dp. species found to be resistant to this treatment included bilophila wadsworthia, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium varium, and bacteroides gracilis. these species were inhibited by concentrations  of > 60 micrograms/ml of dp. the porphyrin-producing species, porphyromonas and prevotella spp, were all inhibited by < or = 2.5 micrograms/ml dp and light. comparing the photodynamic activity of the porphyrins used on porphyromonas strains resulted in the following pattern: dp > hpd > hp > pp. porphyromonas spp., gram-positive cocci, and many gram-positive rods (excluding clostridia) were inactivated by hemin (a metal-containing porphyrin) at 10-20 micrograms/ml.  hemin inhibitory action was not affected by light. binding and insertion of dp into bacteria (both inactivated and non-inactivated strains by dp and light) were monitored by the characteristic fluorescence band of bound dp at 622 nm. porphyromonas spp. bound dp tightly, whereas only low binding was seen with b. wadsworthia and other dp-resistant species. high binding of dp to b. wadsworthia  can be achieved by pretreatment of the bacteria with imipenem or cefoxitin, beta-lactam agents known to interfere with the integrity of the cell wall. if cell wall integrity is disturbed (e.g., by these agents), inactivation of b. wadsworthia by dp can occur.

TI  == fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  == a total of 243 strains of fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. the strains included 65 (27%) fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) fusobacterium varium, three (1%) fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) fusobacterium gonidiaformans. most fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. these included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. the organisms most commonly isolated with fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. (95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == effect of co2 on susceptibilities of anaerobes to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin.
AB  == the oxyrase agar dilution method (oxyrase, inc., mansfield, ohio), which provides an anaerobic environment without added co2, was compared with the reference agar  dilution method recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (anaerobic chamber with 10% co2) to test the susceptibilities of 302 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes to erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin. for erythromycin, the overall mic for 50% of isolates tested (mic50) was 0.5 micrograms/ml and the mic90 was 8.0 micrograms/ml by the oxyrase method, whereas they were 4.0 and 64.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, under standard anaerobic conditions with co2. at a breakpoint of 4.0 micrograms/ml, 88% of strains were susceptible to erythromycin by the oxyrase method, whereas 63% were susceptible in the chamber. the corresponding mic50s and mic90s of azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin by the oxyrase method were 0.5 and 8.0, 0.25 and 4.0, and 0.5 and 16.0 micrograms/ml, respectively, whereas in the chamber they were 4.0 and > 64.0, 2.0 and 64.0, and 2.0 and 64.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. at a breakpoint of 8.0 micrograms/ml for these three drugs, 89, 92, and 85% of the isolates, respectively, were susceptible by the oxyrase method, whereas 67%, 72, and 68% of the isolates, respectively, were susceptible in the chamber. most strains resistant to all four compounds by both  methods were bacteroides distasonis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium varium and non-clostridium perfringens clostridium species. results of the study  may lead to a reappraisal of the role played by macrolides and azalides in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == a selective medium for fusobacterium spp.
AB  == a new selective medium (jvn) for the isolation of fusobacterium spp. from clinical material is described. the medium incorporates josamycin, vancomycin and norfloxacin (at 3, 4 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively) as the selective agents, plus 5% defibrinated horse blood in fastidious anaerobe agar base (lab m). this formula allowed luxuriant growth of all 82 strains (eight recognized species) of  fusobacteria tested, while significantly inhibiting 51/51 (100%) strains of facultative anaerobes and 45/51 (88%) strains of other obligate anaerobes. jvn medium allowed the successful isolation of strains of fusobacterium naviforme, f. nucleatum and f. necrophorum from the gingivae of 9/16 healthy volunteers, and strains of f. varium and f. mortiferum from faecal suspensions seeded with these  organisms.

TI  == intrageneric relationships of members of the genus fusobacterium as determined by reverse transcriptase sequencing of small-subunit rrna.
AB  == the phylogenetic interrelationships of 14 members of the genus fusobacterium were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the 16s rrna sequences of these organisms. the sequence data revealed considerable intrageneric heterogeneity. the four species fusobacterium nucleatum (including f. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, "f. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme," and "f. nucleatum subsp. animalis"), fusobacterium alocis, fusobacterium periodonticum, and fusobacterium simiae, which colonize oral cavities, exhibited high levels of sequence homology with each other and formed a distinct group within the genus. fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium varium,  and fusobacterium ulcerans also formed a phylogenetically coherent group, as did  the two species fusobacterium gonidiaformans and fusobacterium necrophorum. fusobacterium russii and fusobacterium necrogenes displayed no specific relationship with any of the other fusobacteria. the sequence data are discussed  in the context of previous physiological and chemical findings.

TI  == pathways of glutamate catabolism among fusobacterium species.
AB  == glutamate is a major source of energy for fusobacterium species but its mode of catabolism has not hitherto been elucidated. cell suspensions of f. nucleatum and f. varium, as representative species from the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, respectively, both decarboxylated position-labelled glutamate but by different pathways. 14co2 was released only from c-5 by f. nucleatum whereas f. varium decarboxylated glutamate at either c-1 or c-5. in both species, 2 mols of  glutamate fermented yielded 2 mols of acetate and 1 mol of butyrate, suggesting the possibility of three metabolic pathways: the 2-oxoglutarate, mesaconate and 4-aminobutyrate pathways. enzymes representative of the three pathways were assayed for in cell-free extracts of fusobacteria. all species tested possessed high levels of both glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase, indicating the presence of the 2-oxoglutarate pathway. enzymes representative of  the mesaconate pathway were detected in f. sulci, f. ulcerans, f. mortiferum and  f. varium, while the latter two species also possessed the 4-aminobutyrate pathway. the pathways of glutamate catabolism therefore bore no relationship to the site of isolation of the fusobacteria tested but instead correlated with their chemotaxonomic properties. thus, f. varium, f. mortiferum, f. ulcerans and  f. sulci, which possess a peptidoglycan structure based on diaminopimelic acid, have either two or three pathways for glutamate catabolism whereas f. nucleatum and other species that have a lanthionine-based murein metabolized glutamate solely by the 2-oxoglutarate pathway.

TI  == identification of fusobacterium species by the electrophoretic migration of glutamate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate reductase in relation to their dna base composition and peptidoglycan dibasic amino acids.
AB  == rapid identification of fusobacterium spp. is hampered by their inability to ferment carbohydrates and the availability of relatively few useful phenotypic characters. in an attempt to identify new diagnostic markers for species, we reported recently the potential utility of glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) electrophoretic mobilities for distinguishing eight species of fusobacterium. we  have extended these observations to include all recognised members of the genus except f. prausnitzii and f. perfoetens, and our results show that they cluster into three broad electrophoretic groups. some species, such as f. periodonticum,  f. simiae and f. necrophorum, possessed gdh with similar electrophoretic mobilities. however, within such clusters, the electrophoretic migration of 2-oxoglutarate reductase (ogr) distinguished between species. neither gdh or ogr  mobility alone clearly differentiated all species, but their combined use provided unambiguous discrimination of all species except f. varium and f. mortiferum. the dna base compositions of all species except f. naviforme (atcc 25832) and f. sulci, were within the range 26-34 mol% g + c, suggesting the genus may be homogeneous. however, the peptidoglycan composition divided the genus into two major groups that contained either lanthionine or diaminopimelic acid; f. mortiferum peptidoglycan contained both dibasic amino acids.

TI  == cell-wall-defective variants of fusobacterium.
AB  == the activity of antimicrobial agents against fusobacterium species has been reported as variable in the literature. for some strains, the inconsistency arises from difficulty in determining the endpoint of growth in agar dilution susceptibility tests. certain strains persist as a subtle haze beyond the levels  of antibiotic that permit conventional colonial growth. we have determined by light and electron microscopy that this haze represents the colonial growth of cell-wall-defective (cwd) variants of the parent fusobacterium. the cwd forms could be propagated indefinitely in hypertonic medium containing the antibiotic inducing agent. however, when the antibiotic was eliminated, the organisms would  revert to their native morphology. formation of cwd variants was observed in the  presence of cell-wall-active drugs (e.g., beta-lactam agents) but not with drugs  that work by a different mechanism (e.g., clindamycin or chloramphenicol). fourteen of 22 f. varium strains, 8 of 11 f. mortiferum strains, 2 of 10 f. gonidiaformans strains, and 1 of 4 of f. necrophorum strains could be induced to  a cwd form in vitro in the usual agar dilution susceptibility test. although the  clinical significance of cwd variants of fusobacterium is unknown, they may be a  source of confusion in interpreting agar dilution susceptibility tests.

TI  == 5s ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in bacteroides and fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  == the 5s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) sequences were determined for bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides capillosus, bacteroides veroralis, porphyromonas gingivalis, anaerorhabdus furcosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium mortiferum, and fusobacterium varium. a dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5s rrna sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16s rrna analyses. in the 5s rrna dendrogram, bacteroides clustered together with cytophaga and fusobacterium, as in 16s rrna analyses. intraphylum relationships deduced from 5s rrnas suggested that bacteroides is specifically related to cytophaga rather than to fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16s rrna analyses. previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5s rrna sequence analysis.

"fingerprinting" of oral fusobacteria may be readily accomplished by polypeptide analysis.

TI  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli: their role in infection and patterns of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. ii. little-known fusobacterium species and miscellaneous genera.
AB  == twenty infrequently reported species of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli other than fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum, and members of the genus bacteroides were studied with regard to their role in infection and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. in addition, the literature regarding the recovery of these organisms from both the normal flora and infections of humans was reviewed. during a six-year period at the wadsworth clinical anaerobic bacteriology research laboratory (veterans administration wadsworth medical center, los angeles, calif.), 39 (6%) of 679 specimens obtained from anaerobic infections yielded "other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli" (ognab). fusobacterium naviforme, fusobacterium gonidiaformans, fusobacterium varium, fusobacterium mortiferum, and fusobacterium russii were the most commonly isolated ognab. most  of the ognab tested were resistant to erythromycin, and most strains, except for  f. varium, were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics and clindamycin. chloramphenicol and metronidazole were active against all strains of ognab tested. certain fusobacterium species are undoubtedly previously unrecognized members of the normal flora of the oropharynx, upper respiratory tract, or urogenital tract and may be present in infections derived from these floras.

TI  == chemical structure of the lipid a component of lipopolysaccharides from fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the lipid a component of lipopolysaccharides from fusobacterium nucleatum fev 1 consists of beta-1',6-linked d-glucosamine disaccharides, which carry two phosphate groups: one in glycosidic and one in ester linkage. the amino groups of the glucosamine disaccharides are substituted by d-3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid. the hydroxyl groups of the disaccharide backbone are acylated by tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, and d-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acids. part of the ester-bound d-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid is 3-o-substituted by tetradecanoic acid. whereas a similar pattern of fatty acids was detected in lipopolysaccharides from two other f. nucleatum strains, the amide-bound fatty acid in f. varium and f. mortiferum was d-3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid. the chemical relationships of lipid a from fusobacteria and other gram-negative bacteria are discussed.

TI  == hemagglutinating activity of fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == gingival isolates of oral fusobacterium nucleatum strains (gram-negative anaerobic fusiform bacilli) have shown the characteristic ability to hemagglutinate a variety of erythrocytes (rbc) of human and animal origin. other  members of the genus tested (f. necrophorus, f. varium, and f. mortiferum) displayed little if any ability to hemagglutinate rbc. the hemagglutination (ha)  activity could be observed in the f. nucleatum strains with the whole cells and in most instances with sonicated preparations of the organisms. the ha activity was observed in cell wall preparations of the organism and appeared dependent upon a heat-labile protein component of the cell wall. in decreasing order, the rbc that would hemagglutinate with the smallest concentration of ha preparations  were rabbit, monkey, human, sheep, horse, and ox. no differences in ha activity of the preparations with cells from the various human blood types were noted. absorption of the ha preparation of one strain with human cells removed ha moiety was bound to the cells via a ca2+ binding site interaction since ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and ethylene glycol-bis-n,n'-tetraacetic acid inhibited binding, and ha could be reestablished by the addition of ca2+ but not  mg2+. rabbit antisera to the f. nucleatum strains inhibited ha activity when tested with the ha preparation in the standard test, whereas anti-leptotrichia buccalis sera or normal rabbit sera had no effect. a tanned-cell passive ha test  with rabbit anti-f. nucleatum sera displayed reactivity between the homologous strains but little reactivity with the other fusobacterium species tested.

(5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.
