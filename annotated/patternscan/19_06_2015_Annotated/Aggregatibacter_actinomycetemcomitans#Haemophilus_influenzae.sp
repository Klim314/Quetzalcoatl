TI  == classification, identification, and clinical significance of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with host specificity for humans.
AB  == the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the current classification and identification of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with exclusive or predominant host specificity for humans. haemophilus influenzae and  some of the other haemophilus species are commonly encountered in the clinical microbiology laboratory and demonstrate a wide range of pathogenicity, from life-threatening invasive disease to respiratory infections to a nonpathogenic, commensal lifestyle. new species of haemophilus have been described (haemophilus  pittmaniae and haemophilus sputorum), and the new genus aggregatibacter was created to accommodate some former haemophilus and actinobacillus species (aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter segnis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). aggregatibacter species are now a dominant etiology of infective endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms (hacek endocarditis), and a. aphrophilus has emerged as an important cause of brain abscesses. correct identification of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species based on phenotypic characterization can be challenging. it has become clear that 15 to 20% of presumptive h. influenzae isolates from the respiratory tracts of healthy individuals do not belong to this species but represent nonhemolytic variants of  haemophilus haemolyticus. due to the limited pathogenicity of h. haemolyticus, the proportion of misidentified strains may be lower in clinical samples, but even among invasive strains, a misidentification rate of 0.5 to 2% can be found.  several methods have been investigated for differentiation of h. influenzae from  its less pathogenic relatives, but a simple method for reliable discrimination is not available. with the implementation of identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the more rarely encountered species of haemophilus and aggregatibacter will increasingly be identified in clinical microbiology practice. however, identification of some strains will still be problematic, necessitating dna sequencing of multiple housekeeping gene fragments or full-length 16s rrna genes.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == rbsb (nthi_0632) mediates quorum signal uptake in nontypeable haemophilus influenzae strain 86-028np.
AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is a respiratory commensal and opportunistic pathogen, which persists within biofilms on airway mucosal surfaces. for many species, biofilm formation is impacted by quorum signalling. our prior work shows that production of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) promotes biofilm development and persistence for nthi 86-028np. nthi 86-028np encodes an abc transporter annotated as a ribose transport system that includes a protein (rbsb) with similarity to the escherichia coli lsrb and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans rbsb proteins that bind ai-2. in this study, inactivation of rbsb significantly reduced uptake of ai-2 and the ai-2 precursor dihydroxypentanedione (dpd) by nthi 86-028np. moreover, dpd uptake was not competitively inhibited by ribose or other pentose sugars. transcript levels of rbsb increased in response to dpd and as bacteria approached stationary-phase growth. the nthi 86-028np rbsb mutant also formed biofilms with significantly reduced thickness and total biomass and reduced surface phosphorylcholine, similar to a luxs mutant. infection studies revealed that loss of rbsb impaired bacterial persistence in the chinchilla middle ear, similar to our previous results with luxs mutants. based on these data, we conclude that in nthi 86-028np, rbsb is a luxs/ai-2 regulated protein that is required for uptake of and response to ai-2.

TI  == the extra-membranous domains of the competence protein hofq show dna binding, flexibility and a shared fold with type i kh domains.
AB  == secretins form large oligomeric assemblies in the membrane that control both macromolecular secretion and uptake. several pasteurellaceae are naturally competent for transformation, but the mechanism for dna assimilation is largely unknown. in haemophilus influenzae, the secretin come has been demonstrated to be essential for dna uptake. in closely related aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, an opportunistic pathogen in periodontitis, the come homolog hofq is believed to be the outer membrane dna translocase. here, we report the structure of the extra-membranous domains of hofq at 2.3 a resolution  by x-ray crystallography. we also show that the extra-membranous domains of hofq  are capable of dna binding. the structure reveals two secretin-like folds, the first of which is formed by means of a domain swap. the second domain displays extensive structural similarity to k homology (kh) domains, including the presence of a gxxg motif, which is essential for the nucleotide-binding function  of kh domains, suggesting a possible mechanism for dna binding by hofq. the data  indicate a direct involvement in dna acquisition and provide insight into the molecular basis for natural competence.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == identification of hacek clinical isolates by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry is a rapid and accurate tool for the identification of many microorganisms. we assessed this technology for the identification of 103 haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae (hacek) clinical isolates and 20 haemophilus influenzae clinical isolates. ninety-three percent of hacek organisms were identified correctly to the genus level using the bruker database, and 100% were identified to the genus level using a custom database that included clinical isolates.

TI  == characterization of a novel riboswitch-regulated lysine transporter in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is an opportunistic pathogen that resides primarily in the mammalian oral cavity. in this environment, a. actinomycetemcomitans faces numerous host- and microbe-derived stresses, including intense competition for nutrients and exposure to the host immune system. while it is clear that a. actinomycetemcomitans responds to precise cues  that allow it to adapt and proliferate in the presence of these stresses, little  is currently known about the regulatory mechanisms that underlie these responses. many bacteria use noncoding regulatory rnas (ncrnas) to rapidly alter gene expression in response to environmental stresses. although no ncrnas have been reported in a. actinomycetemcomitans, we propose that they are likely important for colonization and persistence in the oral cavity. using a bioinformatic and experimental approach, we identified three putative metabolite-sensing riboswitches and nine small regulatory rnas (srnas) in a. actinomycetemcomitans during planktonic and biofilm growth. molecular characterization of one of the riboswitches revealed that it is a lysine riboswitch and that its target gene, lyst, encodes a novel lysine-specific transporter. finally, we demonstrated that  lyst and the lyst lysine riboswitch are conserved in over 40 bacterial species, including the phylogenetically related pathogen haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == molecular phylogenetic analysis of tryptophanyl-trna synthetase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == aminoacyl-trna synthetase family enzymes are of particular interest for creating  universal phylogenetic trees and understanding the gene flow as these enzymes perform the basic and analogous biochemical function of protein synthesis in all  extant organisms. among them, tryptophanyl-trna synthetase (trp-rs) plays a foremost role in phylogeny owing to the close relationship with tyrosine-trna synthetase. in this study, the sequence of the gene trp-rs was amplified using degenerated adenylation domain primers in the periodontal bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the sequence of the cloned pcr amplicon confirmed the adenylation domain sequence with glutamic acid residue, which is absent in five other oral bacteria used in this study as well as in a number of other bacteria described in the database. the trp-rs sequence analysis prevailed  the identify elements such as rossmann-fold sequence and trna(trp) binding domains including acceptor stem and anticodon. a theoretical model of trp-rs of a. actinomycetemcomitans was generated. guided docking of the ligand tryptophanyl-5'-amp revealed a highly identical active site in comparison with the bacterial template. the phylogenetic positioning of trp-rs among a group of oral bacterial species revealed that a. actinomycetemcomitans is closely related  to haemophilus influenzae, h. ducreyi and pasteurella multocida.

TI  == membrane morphology and leukotoxin secretion are associated with a novel membrane protein of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria display either a flat or an irregular outer membrane. the  periodontal pathogen aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans has an irregular outer membrane. we have identified a gene that is associated with the biogenesis of this morphology. the gene is part of a three-gene operon and codes for a 141-kda protein designated morphogenesis protein c (morc), which is conserved in several gram-negative bacteria including haemophilus influenzae and  pasteurella multocida. insertional inactivation of this gene resulted in the conversion of an irregularly shaped membrane to a flat membrane. associated with  this morphological change were the autoaggregation of the bacteria during planktonic growth and a concomitant increase in the surface hydrophobicity of the bacterium. the absence of morc also resulted in the loss of the secretion of leukotoxin but not the ltxa transcription. our findings suggest that morc is critical for membrane morphology and leukotoxin secretion in a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == evidence that the cytolethal distending toxin locus was once part of a genomic island in the periodontal pathogen aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans strain y4.
AB  == the authors have previously shown that the periodontal pathogen aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans y4 contains an operon for a genotoxin known as the cytolethal distending toxin (cdt). the cdt locus in strain y4 is flanked by remnants of heterologous plasmid and integrase sequences. in this study, the dna sequence immediately downstream from the cdt locus on the y4  chromosome was examined. the extended sequence contained a region that had all the characteristics of a typical bacterial pathogenicity or genomic island. the genomic island (giy4-1) was approximately 22 kb long, was flanked by a bacteriophage attachment (att) sequence and contained a full-length integrase/resolvase gene (xerd). a total of 22 complete and partial orfs represented putative dna replication/dna binding/conjugation proteins as well as  hypothetical proteins. giy4-1 was most closely related to putative genomic islands in haemophilus ducreyi 35000hp and haemophilus influenzae 86-028np and to a chromosomal region in haemophilus somnus 129pt. giy4-1 was not present in hk1651, which was used as the prototype strain for genomic sequencing of a. actinomycetemcomitans. several sequences in giy4-1 were homologous to orfs found  on the a. actinomycetemcomitans plasmid pvt745. none of the identified orfs in giy4-1 appeared to encode potential virulence genes. however, several unique observations supported the possibility that the cdt locus of a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 was originally contained within the genomic island.

TI  == comparative functional genomic analysis of pasteurellaceae adhesins using phage display.
AB  == the pasteurellaceae contain a number of important animal pathogens. although related, the various members of this family cause a diversity of pathology in a wide variety of organ systems. adhesion is an important virulence factor in bacterial infections. surprisingly little is known about the adhesins of the pasteurellaceae. to attempt to identify the genes coding for adhesins to some key components of the hosts extracellular matrix molecules, phage display libraries of fragmented genomic dna from haemophilus influenzae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were prepared in the phage display vector pg8saet. the libraries were screened against human or porcine fibronectin, serum albumin or a  commercial extracellular matrix containing type iv collagen, laminin and heparin  sulphate. four genes encoding putative adhesins were identified. these genes code for: (i) a 34 kda human serum albumin binding protein from haemophilus influenzae; (ii) a 12.8 kda fibronectin-binding protein from pasteurella multocida; (iii) a 13.7 kda fibronectin-binding protein from a. actinomycetemcomitans; (iv) a 9.5 kda serum albumin-binding protein from a. pleuropneumoniae. none of these genes have previously been proposed to code for adhesins. the applications of phage display with whole bacterial genomes to identify genes encoding novel adhesins in this family of bacteria are discussed.

TI  == genomic distribution and functions of uptake signal sequences in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is naturally competent for transformation, with a transformation system similar to that of haemophilus influenzae that preferentially takes up dna bearing uptake signal sequences (uss) with the same 9-base uss core. this study examined the function of the extended 29-base uss, which comprises a highly conserved 1st region (containing the 9-base core) and 2nd and 3rd semi-conserved at-rich regions, in transformation of a. actinomycetemcomitans. transformation frequency was not affected by either location (in middle or at 5' end) or quantity (one or two) of uss in donor dna. relative transformation efficiencies (in comparison to the positive control) were 28-67 % for linear dna with single-base mutations in the uss 1st region, and 47 % and 73 %, respectively, for linear dna with uss that contained either a non-consensus 2nd or a non-consensus 3rd region. plasmids with a stand-alone 1st  or a stand-alone 2nd-3rd region exhibited 21 % and 6 % relative transformation efficiencies, respectively. it was also noted that a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae were similar in the frequencies and distribution patterns of uss in their genomes. in conclusion, all three regions of the extended 29-base uss are required for optimum transformation in a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == aae, an autotransporter involved in adhesion of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to epithelial cells.
AB  == the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans possesses myriad virulence factors, among them the ability to adhere to and invade epithelial cells. recent advances in the molecular manipulation of this pathogen and the sequencing of strain hk 1651 (http://www.genome.ou.edu/act.html) have facilitated examination of the genetics of its interaction with epithelial cells. the related gram-negative organism, haemophilus influenzae, possesses autotransporter adhesins. a search of the sequence database of strain hk 1651 revealed a homologue with similarity in the pore-forming domain to that of the h. influenzae autotransporter, hap. a. actinomycetemcomitans mutants deficient in the homologue, aae, showed reduced binding to epithelial cells. a method for making a. actinomycetemcomitans suny 465 transiently resistant to spectinomycin was used with conjugation to generate an isogenic aae mutant. an allelic replacement mutant was created in the naturally transformable a. actinomycetemcomitans strain atcc 29523. lactoferrin, an important part of the innate host defense system, protects against bacterial infection by bactericidal and antiadhesion mechanisms. lactoferrin in human milk removes or cleaves hap and another autotransporter, an  immunoglobulin a1 protease, from the surface of h. influenzae, thereby reducing their binding to epithelial cells. human milk whey had similar effects on aae from a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29523 and its binding to epithelial cells; however, there was little effect on the binding of suny 465. a difference in the  genetic structure of aae in the two strains, apparently due to the copy number of a 135-base repeated sequence, may be the cause of the differential action of lactoferrin. aae is the first a. actinomycetemcomitans gene involved in adhesion  to epithelial cells to be identified.

TI  == differences in iron acquisition from human haemoglobin among strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == to get a better insight into the physiology of the high-toxic jp2 clone of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, which is strongly associated with juvenile periodontitis in adolescents of african descent, the modes of iron  acquisition in this clone were examined and compared to those of other strains of the species. none of the strains examined could utilize human transferrin as a source of iron. this was in accordance with the presence of a non-functional tbpa gene, which normally encodes the a subunit of the transferrin-binding-protein complex. southern blot analysis indicated that functional duplications of tbpa were not present in the genome. thus, a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be in a process of evolution, in which iron acquisition from host transferrin is not essential as in many other members of the pasteurellaceae. all strains could utilize haem as a source of iron. all 11 a. actinomycetemcomitans strains examined harboured a single genomic sequence with homology to the hgpa gene encoding haemoglobin-binding protein a in haemophilus influenzae. however, in all three strains belonging to the jp2 clone and in one serotype e strain hgpa was a  pseudogene. seven other strains possessed a functional hgpa gene which, according to insertion mutagenesis experiments, was responsible for the ability of these strains to utilize haemoglobin as a source of iron. thus, the presence of an hgpa pseudogene and the inability to use human haemoglobin as an iron source discriminate the high-toxic jp2 clone from low-toxic serotype b strains and most  other strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == natural transformation and dna uptake signal sequences in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a member of the family pasteurellaceae and a major causative agent of periodontitis. while several genera from this family are known to be competent for transformation, a. actinomycetemcomitans has yet to be fully characterized. here we show that the competence of a. actinomycetemcomitans is remarkably similar to that of haemophilus influenzae. in addition to having a similar frequency of transformation as h. influenzae, a. actinomycetemcomitans competence could also be induced at least 100-fold by cyclic amp, suggesting that, as in h. influenzae, at least some competence genes  are regulated by catabolite repression. even more intriguing was the discovery of a putative a. actinomycetemcomitans dna uptake signal sequence (uss) virtually identical to the uss of h. influenzae. moreover, we provide evidence that this sequence functions in the same capacity as that from h. influenzae; the sequence  appears to be required and sufficient for dna uptake in a variety of assays. finally, we have taken advantage of this system to develop a simple, highly efficient competence-based method for generating site-directed mutations in the wild-type fimbriated a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == molecular cloning of the fur gene from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == in several bacterial species, iron availability in host tissues is coordinated with the expression of virulence determinants through the fur gene product. initial experiments showed that a cloned escherichia coli fur gene probe hybridized to southern blots of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain jp2 (serotype b) chromosomal dna. the a. actinomycetemcomitans fur gene was then cloned utilizing partial functional complementation of the fur mutant in e. coli  strain h1780. analysis of the cloned dna sequence revealed a 438-bp open reading  frame with a deduced 146-amino-acid sequence exhibiting 80% identity to haemophilus influenzae fur and 62% identity to e. coli fur. the puc aafur gene probe (generated from jp2 serotype b) hybridized to representatives from all five a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes as well as to two strains derived from monkeys, suggesting that fur is widely distributed in a. actinomycetemcomitans. open reading frames having >70% identity with the e. coli and h. influenzae flavodoxin and gyrase a genes, respectively, were found. expression of the a. actinomycetemcomitans fur gene product repressed fiu expression and siderophore production in e. coli. a gel shift assay demonstrated that the expressed a. actinomycetemcomitans fur protein bound the bacterial fur consensus sequence. further characterization of the fur gene product in a. actinomycetemcomitans may  improve our understanding of its role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease  and may lead to specific therapeutic modalities.

TI  == oral bacteria and respiratory infection: effects on respiratory pathogen adhesion and epithelial cell proinflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == several microbiologic and epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between dental plaque, poor oral health, and respiratory diseases such as nosocomial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). a number of hypotheses are suggested to help explain how oral bacteria may participate in  the pathogenesis of respiratory infection. resident bacteria in oral secretions are likely aspirated along with respiratory pathogens and may affect the adhesion of the later organisms to the respiratory epithelium. preliminary studies performed in our laboratory suggest that oral bacteria may modulate the adhesion  of respiratory pathogens to epithelial cell lines. in addition, oral bacterial products or cytokines in oral/pharyngeal aspirates may stimulate cytokine production from respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. the resulting inflamed epithelium may be more susceptible to  respiratory infection. further preliminary data are presented that some species of oral bacteria may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cell lines to an extent similar to that seen for respiratory pathogens.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a gene encoding an immunosuppressive factor from  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a pathogen of localized juvenile periodontitis and adult periodontitis. immunomodulating activity is generally thought to be important in colonization by such pathogenic bacteria. among the proteins possessing these activities, a 14 kda immunosuppressive factor of a. actinomycetemcomitans has been reported by kurita-ochiai and ochiai (infect immun 64: 50-54, 1996). to evaluate this factor, we cloned and characterized the gene encoding it. the immunosuppressive factor was screened from a genomic library of  a. actinomycetemcomitans using an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino acid sequence of the factor. the clone obtained, phi13, contained a 1.5 kbp fragment.  the immunosuppressive factor located in its center. southern blot analysis showed that this factor is common among a. actinomycetemcomitans strains. the open reading frame consisted of 324 bp coding for 107 amino acid residues. the relative molecular mass of the deduced amino acid sequence was calculated to be 11,595. blast analysis indicated that the amino acid sequence is highly homologous with those of thioredoxins from haemophilus influenzae (76.6%), neisseria meningitidis (67.3%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (59.3%). these results suggest that the 14 kda immunosuppressive factor characterized in this study is a thioredoxin.

TI  == cloning and expression of the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans thioredoxin (trx) gene and assessment of cytokine inhibitory activity.
AB  == thioredoxin is a ubiquitous redox control and cell stress protein. unexpectedly,  in recent years, thioredoxins have been found to exhibit both cytokine and chemokine activities, and there is increasing evidence that this class of protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. in spite of this evidence, it has been reported that the oral bacterium and periodontopathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans secretes an immunosuppressive factor (termed suppressive factor 1 [sf1] [t. kurita-ochiai and k. ochiai, infect. immun. 64:50-54, 1996]) whose n-terminal sequence, we have determined, identifies it as  thioredoxin. we have cloned and expressed the gene encoding the thioredoxin of a. actinomycetemcomitans and have purified the protein to homogeneity. the a. actinomycetemcomitans trx gene has 52 and 76% identities, respectively, to the trx genes of escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae. enzymatic analysis revealed that the recombinant protein had the expected redox activity. when the recombinant thioredoxin was tested for its capacity to inhibit the production of  cytokines by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, it showed no significant inhibitory capacity. we therefore conclude that the thioredoxin of a. actinomycetemcomitans does not act as an immunosuppressive factor, at least with  human leukocytes in cultures, and that the identity of sf1 remains to be elucidated.

AB  == cell surface-associated materials of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were extracted by a short incubation of the cell suspension in a tris-buffered saline  in the presence and absence of a restriction enzyme, ecori. the supernatants (which we termed ecori extract and surface extract, respectively) contained a number of extracellularly released proteins. of these proteins, four major proteins were identified by n-terminal sequencing to be the 34 and 39 kda outer membrane proteins, the groel-like protein, and a 47 kda protein homologous to haemophilus influenzae enolase. enolase activity was found in the extracts and its relative amount of activity in the ecori extract from a culture of the mid-exponential growth phase was estimated as 5.7% of total enzyme activity. in contrast, the relative amount of activity of another cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, was extremely low in the extracts and also in the culture supernatant. these results suggest the external localization of enolase in this bacterium.

TI  == molecular characterization and functional analysis of a seca gene homolog in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == results of southern blot analyses and polymerase chain reaction revealed that the gram-negative pathogen, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, harbored dna homologous to the seca gene of escherichia coli. in e. coli, the seca gene product is essential for translocation of proteins across the inner membrane via  the sec system. this a. actinomycetemcomitans seca homolog was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. amino acid sequence analysis of the cloned gene revealed significant homology to the seca proteins of haemophilus influenzae, e.  coli, caulobacter crescentus and bacillus subtilis. although the cloned gene did  not complement a temperature sensitive mutation in the e. coli seca gene, strains harboring the cloned gene did produce a protein that cross-reacted with anti-seca antibody. in addition, the cloned gene did restore sensitivity to sodium azide in an e. coli azide mutant. these data support the hypothesis that a. actinomycetemcomitans may use a system similar to the sec system of e. coli to transport proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane, but suggest that the a. actinomycetemcomitans gene product may require genera-specific sec proteins to complement some sec mutations in e. coli.

TI  == direct selection of is903 transposon insertions by use of a broad-host-range vector: isolation of catalase-deficient mutants of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == transposon mutagenesis in bacteria generally requires efficient delivery of a transposon suicide vector to allow the selection of relatively infrequent transposition events. we have developed an is903-based transposon mutagenesis system for diverse gram-negative bacteria that is not limited by transfer efficiency. the transposon, is903phikan, carries a cryptic kan gene, which can be expressed only after successful transposition. this allows the stable introduction of the transposon delivery vector into the host. generation of insertion mutants is then limited only by the frequency of transposition. is903phikan was placed on an incq plasmid vector with the transposase gene located outside the transposon and expressed from isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg)-inducible promoters. after transposase induction, is903phikan insertion mutants were readily selected in escherichia coli by their resistance to kanamycin. we used is903phikan to isolate three catalase-deficient mutants of the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans from a library of random insertions. the mutants display increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and all have is903phikan insertions within an open reading frame whose predicted product is closely related to other  bacterial catalases. nucleotide sequence analysis of the catalase gene (designated kata) and flanking intergenic regions also revealed several occurrences of an 11-bp sequence that is closely related to the core dna uptake signal sequence for natural transformation of haemophilus influenzae. our results demonstrate the utility of the is903phikan mutagenesis system for the study of a. actinomycetemcomitans. because is903phikan is carried on a mobilizable, broad-host-range incq plasmid, this system is potentially useful in a variety of  bacterial species.

TI  == identification of genes coding for exported proteins of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == random fusions of genomic dna fragments to a partial gene encoding a signal sequence-deficient bacterial alkaline phosphatase were utilized to screen for exported proteins of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in escherichia coli. twenty-four phoa(+) clones were isolated and sequenced. membrane localization signals in the form of signal sequences were deduced from most of these sequences. several of the deduced amino acid sequences were found to be homologous to known exported or membrane-associated proteins. the complete genes  corresponding to two of these sequences were isolated from an a. actinomycetemcomitans lambda phage library. one gene was found to be homologous to the outer membrane lipoprotein lolb. the second gene product had homology with a haemophilus influenzae protein and was localized to the inner membrane of a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == bacteriostatic and bactericidal in vitro activities of clarithromycin and erythromycin against periodontopathic actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the susceptibilities of 87 periodontitis-associated strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to clarithromycin and erythromycin were determined by standard methodology recommended for haemophilus influenzae. for clarithromycin the mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited was </=2.0 microg/ml and the  minimal bactericidal concentration at which 90% of the strains were killed was </=4.0 microg/ml, suggesting that it would be a candidate for therapeutic trials  in patients with periodontitis.

TI  == expression of iron binding proteins and hemin binding activity in the dental pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to express a polypeptide immunologically related to the neisseria gonorrhoeae fbpa iron binding protein. in addition, the expression of hitb and hitc homologs was detected by northern blot analysis. this periodontal pathogen also expresses a polypeptide homologous  to the 31-kda haemophilus influenzae protein, which shows amino acid sequence homology with the fima and yfea proteins from streptococcus parasanguis and yersinia pestis, respectively. both a. actinomycetemcomitans protein homologs were located within the periplasmic space, and their synthesis was regulated by the iron and hemin concentration of the culture medium. southern and western blot analysis together with molecular cloning revealed the presence of a fur-like repressor, which may control the iron regulation of gene expression in this bacterium. cultivation in the presence of hemin or congo red revealed the ability of this organism to bind hemin. this binding activity was further confirmed by isolating escherichia coli dh5 alpha clones that produced red and brown colonies  on agar plates containing congo red and hemin, respectively, after transformation with an a. actinomycetemcomitans gene library.

TI  == the effect of smoking on serum igg2 reactive with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == high titers of serum igg2 reactive with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are  present in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients and it appears that anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans may be protective. smoking is associated with increased periodontal disease severity in generalized early-onset periodontitis (g-eop) patients, but is not associated with periodontal disease severity in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp). furthermore, smoking is associated with reduced serum igg2 levels in black patients with g-eop but not in those with ljp. based on this selective effect of smoking, we hypothesized that smoking would be associated with a reduction of specific igg2 reactive with a. actinomycetemcomitans in black g-eop patients but not black ljp patients. in addition, we examined igg2 responses to carbohydrate antigens from non-periodontal pathogens including haemophilus influenzae b oligosaccharide antigen (hib) and the streptococcus pneumoniae antigen phosphocholine (pc). smoking status was assessed from serum cotinine levels, and igg2 specific for a.  actinomycetemcomitans, hib, and pc was assessed by elisa. our study revealed that smoking was correlated with a dramatic reduction in serum igg2 anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans in g-eop smokers but not in ljp smokers. in contrast, anti-hib igg2 and anti-pc igg2 were not affected in either g-eop or ljp patients. in short, these results indicate that smoking is associated with a reduction in serum igg2 anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans in black g-eop subjects, but igg2 reactive with other antigens may not be reduced in g-eop smokers.

TI  == heterogeneity of antibodies reactive with the dominant antigen of actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the serotype b-specific carbohydrate antigen (sbag) of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 is reported to be the o antigen of lipopolysaccharide, and the highest titers of serum antibody reactive with a. actinomycetemcomitans in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients bind sbag. these high titers of serum antibody reactive with sbag are associated with a lesser extent and severity of periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to determine if a limited number of genes code for anti-sbag antibodies as has been shown for immunoglobulin g (igg) reactive with the type b polysaccharide from haemophilus influenzae. serum  igg reactive with the sbag was prepared from 20 high-titer eop patients by affinity chromatography. the igg subclass concentrations were determined, and heterogeneity was analyzed by isoelectric focusing (ief). igg2 was the dominant subclass (83% of total igg) in the anti-sbag igg fraction and represented an average of 1.33% of total serum igg2. the igg2 reactive with sbag was isolated from the affinity-purified igg fraction by affinity chromatography with protein a and subclass-specific monoclonal antibodies. on ief gels, only 4 to 20 bands were observed in the anti-sbag igg fractions, indicating limited heterogeneity. n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of eight representative anti-sbag igg2 preparations indicated that variable heavy and light chains consisted largely of  v(h)iii and v(kappa)ii, respectively. however, a significant fraction of anti-sbag may use v(h) and v(lambda) genes with blocked n termini. in short, these findings indicate that igg reactive with sbag is very much like the antibody reactive with h. influenzae type b polysaccharide. similarities include  igg2 dominance, limited bands on ief gels, supporting an oligoclonal response, and use of genes from v(h)iii and v(kappa)ii regions.

TI  == characterization of a periplasmic protein involved in iron utilization of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the periodontopathic bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans possesses a 35-kda periplasmic iron-repressible protein. its regulation is mediated by the fur protein, as was inferred from the fur-binding consensus sequence at the -35 position of the gene for the 35-kda protein and from the relaxed expression of the gene in a mutant with an altered fur-binding sequence. the 35-kda protein, designated afua, has strong homology to hita and fbpa of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitidis, respectively, which serve as periplasmic iron transport proteins.

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == comparison of susceptibility data for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has been difficult because of the lack of standard susceptibility testing conditions. in this study, minimum inhibitory concentration to tetracycline was evaluated by  comparing different media, air conditions and incubation times. ten of 22 (45%) a. actinomycetemcomitans isolated from periodontally diseased sites grew on media supplemented with 4 micrograms per ml of tetracycline, but minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 0.125 to 8 micrograms/ml depending on the media and condition used. the best results were obtained with brain heart infusion agar (difco laboratories, detroit mi) incubated in 5% co2 for 48 h. eighteen (82%) of  the a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates hybridized with the tet b determinant. the  tet b determinant was transferable between a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates as well as a haemophilus influenzae recipient and appears to be associated with conjugative plasmids.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == multivariate chemosystematics demonstrate two groups of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains.
AB  == chemical analysis by us has indicated that actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is not a homogeneous species. the present study used chemometric methods and a multitude of chemical characters to examine this further. strains were characterized by cell sugar and fatty acid contents, lysis kinetics during edta and edta plus lysozyme exposure, methylene blue reduction, and api zym enzymatic  assessment of whole cells and outer membrane vesicles/fragments. in total, 41 quantitative variables were analyzed from each of 9 strains and treated with principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy. these methods divided a. actinomycetemcomitans into 2 strain groups. one group contained atcc 33384, atcc 29522, fdc 2112 and fdc 2043; the other comprised atcc 29524, atcc 29523, fdc 2097, fdc 511 and fdc y4. with an f-test, the groups (classes) of a. actinomycetemcomitans strains could be distinguished at 95% confidence limits. both groups were distinct from members of the genera haemophilus and pasteurella (haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, pasteurella multocida and pasteurella haemolytica).
