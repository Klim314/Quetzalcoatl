TI  - 454 pyrosequencing reveals changes in the faecal microbiota of adults consuming Lactobacillus casei Zhang.
AB  - Probiotics are believed to help to maintain a healthy balance of the human gut microbiota. Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LcZ) is a novel potential probiotic isolated from the naturally fermented food koumiss. To better understand the impact of this potential probiotic on human intestinal microbiota, 24 subjects were randomly recruited for a longitudinal study: the subjects were required to consume LcZ for 28 days, and faecal samples were collected prior to, during and after the LcZ consumption phase. Alterations in the gut microbiota were monitored using 454 pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction(q-PCR) technologies. We found that the consumption of LcZ significantly altered the composition of intestinal microbiota (P < 0.001) and the gut microbiota diversity. Further analysis at the genus level revealed a positive correlation between LcZ and Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, Propionibacterium, Bifidobacterium and an unidentified genus from Bacteroidaceae and Lachnospiraceae and a negative correlation between LcZ administration and the presence of Clostridium, Phascolarctobacterium, Serratia, Enterococcus, Shigella and Shewanella. Furthermore, these changes were confirmed by q-PCR data.
TI  - Short communication: effect of milk and milk containing Lactobacillus casei on the intestinal microbiota of mice.
AB  - BALB/c mice were fed milk or Lactobacillus casei BL23 in milk for 14d and fecal samples were collected at d 0, 4, and 7 as well as 1 and 8d after the last administration. According to high-throughput DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes extracted from the fecal microbiota, the bacterial diversity in the fecal samples of all mice increased over time. After 14d of administration, the consumption of milk and milk containing L. casei BL23 resulted in distinct effects on the microbial composition in the intestine. Specifically, the proportions of bacteria in the Lactobacillaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Comamonadaceae were significantly higher in mice fed the L. casei BL23-milk culture compared with one or more of the other groups of mice. The relative amounts of Lachnospiraceae were higher and Streptococcaceae were lower in mice fed milk alone. The changes were not found at d 4 and 7 during milk and L. casei feeding and were no longer detected 8d after administration was stopped. This study shows that consumption of milk or probiotic L. casei-containing milk results in non-overlapping, taxa-specific effects on the bacteria in the distal murine intestine.
