TI  == mechanism of conjugated linoleic acid and vaccenic acid formation in human faecal suspensions and pure cultures of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == faecal bacteria from four human donors and six species of human intestinal bacteria known to metabolize linoleic acid (la) were incubated with la in deuterium oxide-enriched medium to investigate the mechanisms of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and vaccenic acid (va) formation. the main cla products in faecal suspensions, rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-cla; ra) and trans-9,trans-11-cla, were labelled at c-13, as were other 9,11 geometric isomers. traces of trans-10,cis-12-cla formed were labelled to a much lower extent. in pure culture, bifidobacterium breve ncfb 2258 formed labelled ra and trans-9,trans-11-cla, while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 16.4, roseburia hominis a2-183t, roseburia inulinivorans a2-192t and ruminococcus obeum-like strain a2-162 converted la to va, labelled in a manner indicating that va was formed via c-13-labelled ra. propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii dsm 4902t, a  possible probiotic, formed mainly ra with smaller amounts of trans-10,cis-12-cla  and trans-9,trans-11-cla, labelled the same as in the mixed microbiota. ricinoleic acid (12-oh-cis-9-18 : 1) did not form cla in the mixed microbiota, in contrast to cla formation described for lactobacillus plantarum. these results were similar to those reported for the mixed microbiota of the rumen. thus, although the bacterial genera and species responsible for biohydrogenation in the rumen and the human intestine differ, and a second route of ra formation via a 10-oh-18 : 1 is present in the intestine, the overall labelling patterns of different cla isomers formation are common to both gut ecosystems. a hydrogen-abstraction enzymic mechanism is proposed that may explain the role of a 10-oh-18 : 1 intermediate in 9,11-cla formation in pure and mixed cultures.

TI  == cell-associated alpha-amylases of butyrate-producing firmicute bacteria from the  human colon.
AB  == selected butyrate-producing bacteria from the human colon that are related to roseburia spp. and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens showed a good ability to utilize a variety of starches for growth when compared with the gram-negative amylolytic anaerobe bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. a major cell-associated amylase of high molecular mass (140-210 kda) was detected in each strain by sds-page zymogram analysis, and genes corresponding to these enzymes were analysed for two representative strains. amy13b from but. fibrisolvens 16/4 is a multi-domain enzyme of 144.6 kda that includes a family 13 glycoside hydrolase domain, and duplicated family 26 carbohydrate-binding modules. amy13a (182.4 kda), from roseburia inulinivorans a2-194, also includes a family 13 domain, which is preceded by two repeat units of approximately 116 aa rich in aromatic residues, an isoamylase n-terminal domain, a pullulanase-associated domain, and an additional unidentified domain. both amy13a and amy13b have n-terminal signal peptides and c-terminal cell-wall sorting signals, including a modified lpxtg motif similar to that involved in interactions with the cell surface in other gram-positive bacteria, a hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a basic c terminus. the overexpressed family 13 domains showed an absolute requirement for  mg2+ or ca2+ for activity, and functioned as 1,4-alpha-glucanohydrolases (alpha-amylases; ec 3.2.1.1). these major starch-degrading enzymes thus appear to be anchored to the cell wall in this important group of human gut bacteria.
