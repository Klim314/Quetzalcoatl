TI  == food preservative potential of gassericin a-containing concentrate prepared from  a cheese whey culture supernatant from lactobacillus gasseri la39.
AB  == gassericin a (ga) is a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39. in this study, ga-containing concentrate was prepared using a cross-flow membrane filtration device (30 kda cut-off) from the culture supernatant of lb. gasseri la39 cultivated in a cheese whey-based food-grade medium. the bacteriocin activity titer in the concentrate was 16 times as high as that of the culture supernatant and was completely maintained through each incubation at 4 degrees c  for 3 months, 37 degrees c for 2 months, 60 degrees c for 5 h, and 100 degrees c  for 30 min. the ga-containing concentrate was used with glycine powder to make custard creams, and then four representative strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans and pseudomonas fluorescens) were individually inoculated at c. 10(3) colony forming units/g in the custard creams. throughout 30 days of incubation at 30 degrees c, all of the inoculated bacteria were completely inhibited by the combination of 5% (w/w) of the ga-containing concentrate and 0.5% (w/w) glycine. this is the first highly practical application of ga to foods as a biopreservative, and the concentration method and the bacteriocin concentrate would contribute to biopreservation of several foods.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  == lactobacillus spp., referred to as ij-1 and ij-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. according to the analyses of 16s rdna sequence, lactobacillus sp. ij-1 showed greater than 99% homology with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016(t), and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 had  greater than 99% homology with the l. gasseri atcc 33323(t) and l. johnsonii atcc 33200(t). the ph changes in the culture media of lactobacillus sp. ij-1 and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. both strains inhibited the growth of  pathogenic microorganisms, such as listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111, salmonella  enterica kctc 12401, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, staphylococcus aureus kctc 3881, and bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.

TI  == effects of gassericins a and t, bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus gasseri, with glycine on custard cream preservation.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri la39 and la158 isolated from human-infant feces produce bacteriocins named gassericins a and t, respectively. both gassericins have high  heat stability (121 degrees c, 10 min), good ph tolerance (ph 2-11), and strong bactericidality against many gram-positive bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria, and thus are expected to be effective food preservatives. a microwell plate assay against 12 strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria showed that the gassericins had broader antibacterial spectra than nisin a. although the gassericins allowed gram-negative isolates to grow, they successfully inhibited the growth of all tested bacterial strains in microwells with the addition of glycine. glycine was bacteriostatic against many strains except lactic acid bacteria. for practical use, gassericin a was efficiently produced by cultivation in a food-grade medium improved using cheese whey, nourishing proteose peptone, and surfactant yolk lecithin. the practical preservative effect of gassericin a and glycine was verified from the viability of 4 isolated strains, bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans, and pseudomonas fluorescens, in custard creams. custard cream containing 123 arbitrary units of gassericin a per milliliter entirely growth-inhibited the 2 gram-positive strains. in custard cream containing an insufficient amount of gassericin a (49 arbitrary units/ml), the gram-positive strains gradually grew but were completely inhibited by the addition of 0.5% (wt/wt) glycine. the 2 gram-negative strains did not multiply even in the additive-free custard cream, probably because of the unsuitable growth environment. this is the first report showing the combined effect of bacteriocin and glycine and their application for  food preservation, which may be helpful for future use in the food industry.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of milkfat globule membrane fractions.
AB  == milkfat globule membranes (mfgms) were prepared from bovine cream according to standard procedures. these membranes and peptide hydrolysates, which were generated by proteolysis with immobilized digestive enzymes, were screened for antibacterial activity against escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes,  salmonella enterica typhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus gasseri. assays were first performed on beef heart infusion (bhi) plates spotted with test protein-peptide fractions and then seeded with lawns of indicator cells to monitor the zone of growth inhibition. under these experimental conditions, mfgms were most active against salmonella typhimurium and p. fluorescens. however, antibacterial activity was not seen after plating on luria-bertani (lb) medium. we determined that the antimicrobial effects observed on bhi plates were due to the generation of h2o2 by xanthine oxidase, a major protein constituent of the mfgms, as a result of purine catalysis. this substrate is present in bhi but lacking in lb medium. evaluation of purified xanthine oxidase alone resulted in analogous data trends.  the growth of probiotic lactobacillus strains were affected only marginally when  grown on lactobacilli deman rogosa sharpe plates, suggesting the decreased sensitivity of these bacteria to h2o2. in this study, several mfgm hydrolysates exhibited variable antibacterial activity against test food pathogens on agar plates prepared with m9 minimal media, and this variation was not attributable to xanthine oxidase enzymatic activity. the probiotic microorganisms were mostly resilient to these antibacterial fractions. bovine mfgm fractions may represent an excellent resource material from which to generate native, naturally occurring biodefensive proteins and/or peptides.
