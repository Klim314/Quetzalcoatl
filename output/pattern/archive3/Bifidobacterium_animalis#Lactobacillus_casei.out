assessment of the effect of stress-tolerance acquisition on some basic characteristics of specific probiotics.
the production of viable functional probiotics presupposes stability of strain features in the final product. we evaluated the impact of acquisition of heat-tolerance and subsequent freeze-drying on the adhesion properties of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and bifidobacterium animalis if20/1 and on their ability to inhibit the adhesion of pathogens in a mucus model. both fresh and freeze-dried cultures were evaluated. significant differences were observed between fresh, freeze dried, fresh heat-tolerant and freeze dried heat-tolerant strains, especially in the ability of the freeze dried probiotics to exclude, displace or outcompete pathogens. based on our study characterizing probiotic properties such as adhesion and competitive exclusion, it seems possible to adapt probiotics to processing stresses, such as heat, without significantly changing the probiotic properties of the strains assessed. this may provide new options for future probiotic production technology. however, our results also emphasize that the properties of the stress-adapted strains, as well as the effect of the production processes should always be assessed as these are strain-specific.
incorporation of probiotic bacteria in whey cheese: decreasing the risk of microbial contamination.
for dairy products that are consumed fresh, contamination by spoilage microorganisms and pathogens from the environment is a major concern. contamination has been associated with a number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses; however, consistent data pertaining to the microbial safety of whey cheeses specifically have not been reported. hence, the goals of this research effort were (i) to manufacture a probiotic whey cheese with bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus casei and (ii) to assess the antimicrobial activity of these probiotics against a set of foodborne pathogens (listeria innocua, salmonella enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus) and food spoilage microorganisms (pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). three ranges of these microbial contaminants were used for inoculation of cheeses: 10(3) to 10(4), 10(4) to 10(6), and 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/g. inoculation in plain culture medium served as a control. the inhibition produced by the probiotics was calculated, and the major effect was found to be bacteriostatic. in specific cases, full inhibition was observed, i.e., by b. animalis against p. aeruginosa and by l. casei against salmonella enteritidis and l. innocua. conversely, the least inhibition was detected for l. casei against p. aeruginosa. our results suggest that use of these probiotic strains can extend the shelf life of whey cheeses and make them safer by delaying or preventing growth of common contaminant bacteria.
comparative study of bifidobacterium animalis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei and saccharomyces boulardii probiotic properties.
the present work investigates some probiotic properties of four different microorganisms (bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis bb-12, escherichia coli emo, lactobacillus casei and saccharomyces boulardii). in vitro and in vivo tests were carried out to compare cell wall hydrophobicity, production of antagonistic substances, survival capacity in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice without pathological consequence, and immune modulation by stimulation of kupffer cells, intestinal siga and il-10 levels. in vitro antagonism against pathogenic bacteria and yeast was only observed for the probiotic bacteria b. animalis and l. casei. the hydrophobic property of the cell wall was higher for b. animalis and e. coli emo, and this property could be responsible for a better ability to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free mice. higher levels of siga were observed mainly for s. boulardii, followed by e. coli emo and b. animalis, and only s. boulardii induced a significant higher level of il-10. in conclusion, for a probiotic use, s. boulardii presented better characteristics in terms of immunomodulation, and b. animalis and l. casei for antagonistic substance production. the knowledge of the different probiotic properties could be used to choice the better microorganism depending on the therapeutic or prophylactic application.
