TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria during fermentation of a traditional Chinese fish product, Chouguiyu (stinky mandarinfish).
AB  - Chouguiyu, or stinky mandarinfish, is a traditional Chinese fermented fish product made of mandarinfish by spontaneous fermentation at the anaerobic condition with low-salt concentration. In order to get a primary understanding of the microbial community presenting in the Chouguiyu fermentation, 61 cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various fermentation period were isolated using MRS agar plates and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and 16S rRNA partial gene sequencing analysis. Eight distinct bacterial species belonging to 6 genera were identified in total. Among them, Lactobacillus sakei was the dominant species (63%) during the fermentation, which exhibited great variety in phenotypic tests but unique genotypic characters. Meanwhile, the other LAB species including Lactococcus (Lc.) garvieae, Lc. lactis, Lc. raffinolactis, Vagococcus sp., Enterococcus hermanniensis, Macrococcus caseolyticus as well as Streptococcus parauberis were also recovered from the different fermentation periods, especially at the initial point of the fermentation. This seems to be the 1st report investigating the LAB composition involved in Chouguiyu fermentation and the data obtained in this study may be valuable for selecting starter culture for Chouguiyu industrial-scale production.
TI  - Identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  - In order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 LAB strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. According to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups, including Enterococcus gallinarum, Lactobacillus acidipiscis, L. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, L. coryniformis subsp. torquens, L. curvatus, L. paraplantarum, L. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, L. plantarum subsp. plantarum, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Weissella hellenica, Weissella paramesenteroides and Carnobacterium divergens. This is the first report to document that C. divergens, L. acidipiscis, L. sakei subsp. carnosus, L. garvieae, phenotypically novel L. lactis subsp. cremoris, E. gallinarum and W. hellenica are present in vegetative forage crops. L. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. Some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth pH and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. These results are useful in understanding the diversity of LAB associated with decayed silage of timothy and orchardgrass.
TI  - Culture-dependent and -independent methods to investigate the microbial ecology of Italian fermented sausages.
AB  - In this study, the microbial ecology of three naturally fermented sausages produced in northeast Italy was studied by culture-dependent and -independent methods. By plating analysis, the predominance of lactic acid bacteria populations was pointed out, as well as the importance of coagulase-negative cocci. Also in the case of one fermentation, the fecal enterocci reached significant counts, highlighting their contribution to the particular transformation process. Yeast counts were higher than the detection limit (> 100 CFU/g) in only one fermented sausage. Analysis of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns and sequencing of the bands allowed profiling of the microbial populations present in the sausages during fermentation. The bacterial ecology was mainly characterized by the stable presence of Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus sakei, but Lactobacillus paracasei was also repeatedly detected. An important piece of evidence was the presence of Lactococcus garvieae, which clearly contributed in two fermentations. Several species of Staphylococcus were also detected. Regarding other bacterial groups, Bacillus sp., Ruminococcus sp., and Macrococcus caseolyticus were also identified at the beginning of the transformations. In addition, yeast species belonging to Debaryomyces hansenii, several Candida species, and Willopsis saturnus were observed in the DGGE gels. Finally, cluster analysis of the bacterial and yeast DGGE profiles highlighted the uniqueness of the fermentation processes studied.
