TI  == decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and candida  spp.
AB  == tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. the polypeptide and its  components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state  of resistance are lacking. in the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. using  a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic and mic90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of staphylococcus aureus of the variety mssa (susceptible to methicillin), staphylococcus aureus of the variety mrsa (methicillin resistant), staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spec., candida albicans and candida parapsilosis was determined. all of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out  to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with mics </= 4mg/l. the tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with mics of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. no acquired resistance of  the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of staphylococcus aureus, both with mssa and mrsa strains. the broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.

TI  == reduction of teat skin mastitis pathogen loads: differences between strains, dips, and contact times.
AB  == the purpose of these experiments was to (1) assess differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to teat disinfectants (teat dips), and (2) determine the optimum time for premilking teat dips to remain in contact with teat skin to reduce pathogen loads on teat skin. two experiments were conducted using the excised teat model. in experiment 1, the differences in mastitis pathogen strain sensitivities to 4 commercially available dips (dip a: 1% h2o2; dip b: 1% chlorine dioxide; dip c: 1% iodophor; and dip d: 0.5% iodophor) were evaluated. four strains of 11 common mastitis pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma bovis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hyicus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) were tested. in experiment 2, the percentage log reduction of mastitis pathogens (escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, klebsiella species, staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus xylosus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) on teat skin with 3 commercially available teat dips: dip a; dip d;  and dip e: 0.25% iodophor, using dip contact times of 15, 30, and 45 s, was evaluated. experiment 1 results indicated significant differences in strain sensitivities to dips within pathogen species: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, and streptococcus uberis. species differences were also found where mycoplasma bovis (97.9% log reduction) was the most sensitive to tested teat dips and staphylococcus haemolyticus (71.4% log reduction) the most resistant. experiment 2 results indicated that contact times of 30 and 45 s were  equally effective in reducing recovered bacteria for dips d and e and were also significantly more effective than a 15-s contact time. no differences were seen in recovered bacteria between tested contact times after treatment with dip a. it can be concluded that different mastitis pathogen species and strains within species may possess different sensitivities to teat dips, which may have implications in selection of teat dips on dairies. furthermore, a 30-s premilking dip contact time for iodophors and 15 s for h2o2 dips may be optimal in reducing  pathogen load in the shortest amount of time. a reduction in premilking teat dip  contact time may improve milking parlor efficiency.

TI  == [identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  maldi-tof ms system].
AB  == bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. maldi-tof ms (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time- of- flight mass spectrometry)  system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. the aim of this study was to evaluate the maldi-tof ms system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture  bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. a total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by gram stain were evaluated. these blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between december 2013-february 2014. conventional methods and bd phoenix automated bacterial identification system (becton dickinson, usa) were used for routine identification. the strains were also identified by real-time taqman pcr (qpcr) which was considered as the reference method. in maldi-tof ms method, maldi sepsityper kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using microflex lt instrument and flexcontrol 3.0 software (bruker daltonics, usa). of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci,  90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qpcr, bd phoenix, bruker maldi-tof ms). the other six samples were identified as enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both phoenix and the maldi-tof systems. of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at  the species level (15 s.aureus, 33 s.epidermidis, 29 s.hominis, 10 s.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qpcr method. when comparing the results obtained by qpcr and bruker maldi-tof ms, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. those isolates were identified as s.hominis by qpcr, however two of them were identified as s.haemolyticus and one as s.epidermidis by maldi-tof ms. compared with real-time taqman pcr it was detected that bruker maldi tof ms was identified 100% of s.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) to the genus and species level, respectively. in conclusion, it was thought that bruker maldi  tof ms system may allow rapid and reliable identification of s.aureus and cns directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == predictors of quantitative microbiological analysis of spatter and aerosolization during scaling.
AB  == the aim of this study is to analyze the infection risk through spatter and aerosolization during scaling and to create a prediction model of the total number of hemolytic bacteria. material and methods: air samples were collected prior to patient's arrival and spatter and aerosol samples were collected during  scaling procedure in 80 patients of 4 different dental clinics. the dentists calculated di, ci, dmft. only patients with ci > = 1 were included. the bacteriological results (cfu/m3) were correlated with clinical indicators. patients were divided into 2 groups: one that rinse with sterile water and the other with chlohexidine mouth rinse 0.1%. results and conclusions: medium size effect positive correlations were found between the number of decayed teeth and the total number of bacteria and the total number of hemolytic bacteria that grew on plate attached to the dentist's mask. the mean number of bacteria and the mean number of hemolytic bacteria that grew on plate attached to the dentist's mask were significantly lower in the group that rinse with chlorhexidine 0.1%, when compared to the group that rinsed with sterile water. when controlling for the total number of bacteria and the total number of hemolytic bacteria from air sampling, the total number of hemolytic bacteria that grew on the plate attached  to the dentist's mask can be predicted by ci, group membership and dmft score.

TI  == 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol beta-d-glucuronide, precursor of 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol in human sweat.
AB  == 5alpha-androst-16-en-3alpha-ol (alpha-androstenol) is an important contributor to human axilla sweat odor. it is assumed that alpha-andostenol is excreted from the apocrine glands via a h2 o-soluble conjugate, and this precursor was formally characterized in this study for the first time in human sweat. the possible h2 o-soluble precursors, sulfate and glucuronide derivatives, were synthesized as analytical standards, i.e., alpha-androstenol, beta-androstenol sulfates, 5alpha-androsta-5,16-dien-3beta-ol (beta-androstadienol) sulfate, alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide, alpha-androstenol alpha-glucuronide, beta-androstadienol beta-glucuronide, and alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide furanose. the occurrence of alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide was established by ultra performance liquid chromatography (uplc)/ms (heated electrospray ionization (hesi)) in negative-ion mode in pooled human sweat, containing eccrine and apocrine secretions and collected from 25 female and 24 male underarms. its concentration was of 79 ng/ml in female secretions and 241 ng/ml in male secretions. the release of alpha-androstenol was observed after incubation of the sterile human sweat or alpha-androstenol beta-glucuronide with a commercial glucuronidase enzyme, the urine-isolated bacteria streptococcus agalactiae, and the skin bacteria staphylococcus warneri dsm 20316, staphylococcus haemolyticus dsm 20263, and propionibacterium acnes atcc 6919, reported to have beta-glucuronidase activities. we demonstrated that if alpha- and beta-androstenols and androstadienol sulfates were present in human sweat, their  concentrations would be too low to be considered as potential precursors of malodors; therefore, the h2 o-soluble precursor of alpha-androstenol in apocrine  secretion should be a beta-glucuronide.

TI  == bacteria detected after instrumentation surgery for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis in a canine model.
AB  == objective: this study was designed to identify the presence, type and origin of bacteria adjacent to the metal implant in the infected region in a canine model of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis treated with single-stage anterior autogenous bone grafting and instrumentation. methods: dogs with pyogenic spondylodiscitis underwent one-stage debridement, autogenous bone grafting and titanium plate instrumentation and perioperative antibiotic therapy. the implants and adjacent vertebral bones were removed surgically at various postoperative time points (4,  8, 12 and 24 weeks) for bacteria detection. bacteria were detected from retrieved spinal implants as well as surrounding bones by culture and/or pyrosequencing methods in 17 (85%) of all 20 animals. the positive rate for bacteria presence was 45% by culture and 80% by pyrosequencing method. results: radiological or macroscopic examination showed no signs for infection recurrence in any animal regardless of bacteria presence at the surgical site. however, organism identical with the causative bacterium for spinal infection was found in only two of nine culture-positive animals. conclusion: within the confines of the study, the use of metallic implants in an infected area did not lead to a clinically relevant infection although bacteria may exist at the surgical site. the use of metallic implants in an infected area of the spine is safe. the metallic implants may not  be the "culprit" for the persistence or recurrence of infection.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == reactive oxygen species and the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of isoconazole nitrate.
AB  == bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (isn), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for isn (isn solution or isn-containing creams: travogen or corticosteroid-containing travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. reactive oxygen species (ros) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. compared with ampicillin mics, isn mics for bacillus cereus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus hominis were lower and isn mics for corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and streptococcus salivarius were similar. incubation with isn led to a 50% kill rate for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa). post-isn incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of s. aureus cells were positive for ros. isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a mrsa strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the travocort cream. data suggest that the antibacterial effect of isn may be ros dependent. an antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.

TI  == hydramacin-1 in action: scrutinizing the barnacle model.
AB  == hydramacin-1 (hm1) from the metazoan hydra exerts antimicrobial activity against  a wide range of bacterial strains. notably, hm1 induces the aggregation of bacterial cells, accompanied by precipitation. to date, the proposed mechanism of peptide-lipid interaction, termed the barnacle model, has not been described on the molecular level. here, we show by biochemical and biophysical techniques that the lipid-peptide interactions of hm1 are initiated by electrostatic and hydrophobic effects, in particular, by tryptophan and neighboring polar amino acid residues that cause an interfacial localization of the peptide between two self-contained lipid bilayers. the high binding constants of hm1 upon lipid interaction are in the range of other potent antimicrobial peptides, e.g., magainin, and can be reasonably explained by two distinct epitopes on the surface of the peptide's global structure, which both contain swt(k/r) motifs. the residues of this motif favor localization of the peptide in the head group region of phospholipid bilayers up to a penetration depth of 4 a and a minor participation of the lipids' hydrocarbon regions. our results expand the knowledge about the molecular modes of action antimicrobial peptides use to tackle their target cells. furthermore, the aggregation of living bacteria by hm1 was observed for a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. therefore, the detailed view of peptide-lipid interactions described by the barnacle model consolidates it among the established models.

TI  == microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute copd exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  == background: the aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (aecopd) in clinical practice and to compare them with current  international guidelines. methods: a total of 362 patients with suspected cap were enrolled in 14 european centers in a prospective multicenter study. results: a total of 279 inpatients (cap, n = 222; aecopd, n = 57) were evaluated. a total  of 83 (37 %) cap patients and 25 (44 %) aecopd patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. in patients with cap/aecopd, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. the most frequent pathogens in cap were streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, l. pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, and enterobacter cloacae; in aecopd they were escherichia coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. all cap patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of aecopd patients (mean = 8.9 days) received  antibiotics. cap patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and aecopd patients were given mostly cephalosporins. conclusions: pathogens isolated in cap and aecopd and the antibiotic therapy used are in good  accordance with the guidelines. blood culture, recommended for all cap patients,  was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. this duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.

TI  == an international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: zaaps program results for 2011.
AB  == through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and hong kong. linezolid mic90 values were 2 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the mic90 value was 1 mug/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid  demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. all s. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/ml. three (0.3%) of 928 strains of cons had a linezolid mic of 4 mug/ml and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in l3. there were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (brazil [5],  france [1], germany [2] greece [2], italy [2], ireland [1], and spain [1]) representing 5 species (e. faecium, s. capitis, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, s. lugdenensis). a mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid  mic values; one was a s. haemolyticus isolate with a mic at 4 mug/ml. resistance  rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 zaaps program: cons, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among s aureus, s. pneumoniae, viridans  group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected.  as the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.

AB  == all open wounds are primarily contaminated and subsequently colonized by microorganisms, predominantly bacteria. only about 30% of chronic wounds are also infected. factors which favor the development of infection are the following: large quantity of bacteria, presence of virulence factors, their quantity and number, predominantly the synergy of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and formation of biofilm. common agents of infection of acute and chronic wounds are  staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides spp., and candida albicans. difference between acute and  chronic wound is in the predominance of individual agents, with an observation that staphylococcus aureus is predominant in both cases. atypical agents of chronic wound infection are rare, unusual, not found in the area in which we live, not proven by standard microbiological methods, but molecular methods are needed instead. they are predominantly opportunists, varying in the expression of virulence factors, or they have changed their phenotype characteristics and are not the agents of primary wound infections. they are the agents of secondary infections. atypical agents of the chronic wound infection are diverse, from the  anaerobe group, peptoniphilus spp., anaerococcus spp., bacteroides ureolyticus, finegoldia magma, the group of gram positive rods of the corynebacterium genus, the group of bacteria from aquatic environment mycobacterium fortuitum complex, and vibrio alginolyticus. the targeted samples are biopsy sample as the "gold standard" and/or aspirate, when a significant quantity of exudate is present. targeted samples are obligatory when there is a progression and decomposition of  the base of the wound, increase in the size or depth of the wound, isolation of multiresistant microbes, or absence of clinical response to empirical antimicrobial therapy. in the diagnosis of opportunistic pathogens or atypical agents of chronic wound infection, it is necessary to be thorough, meticulous, and conduct revision of the patient, diagnosis, treatment and samples. crucial for the detection of the agents atypical wound infection is discussion and agreement with clinical microbiologist. essential for the quality diagnosis is decontamination of the wound before taking targeted samples. the targeted sample  is biopsy specimen as the "gold standard", less frequently aspirate, depending on the quantity and content of the wound. swab as a sample is not recommended. if there is no other choice, only exceptionally surface swabs may be taken, but only under the following conditions: decontamination of the wound with the application of levine's or z-technique of taking of swabs.

TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == infection risk from surgeons' eyeglasses.
AB  == purpose: to assess bacterial contamination of 20 eyeglasses from surgeons. methods: 40 samples were taken from the nose pad (n=20) and earpiece (n=20) of 20 eyeglasses from orthopaedic surgeons using a sterile swab stick soaked in sterile distilled water. swabs were incubated and inoculated onto 3 plates: staphylococcus/streptococcus agar plate, mannitol salt plate, and chromogenic agar plate. organisms isolated were identified. results: of 20 eyeglasses, 19 were contaminated with staphylococcus epidermidis (3 of them additionally grew s  haemolyticus or s xylosus) and the remaining one grew s aureus . conclusion: eyeglasses are a source of surgical infection. contamination can be caused by direct contact of the eyeglasses to the wound and indirect contact by the surgeon's fingers, splashes from saline irrigation, and through air. therefore, disinfection should be performed for eyeglasses of surgeons. the use of surgical  visor masks or filtered exhaust helmets (space suits) are alternatives.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == sensitivity of skin microflora to antibacterial medications administered to patients with different status of hiv.
AB  == the attenuation of the tolerability of hiv-infected patients to the infectious agents leads to the development of frequent relapses both primary pyoderma and secondary bacterial complications of dermatoses of unclear nature that aggravates current status of the main disease. regarding about mention data, the study of biotype spectrum of infectious agents in pustular skin lesions and their resistance patterns to antibacterial preparations in patients with pyoderma and with different hiv status is of great interest. the article presents comparative  results of the study of bacterial composition in the pus of 124 patients with pyoderma and hiv infection and in 70 patients with pyoderma but without hiv. it is possible on the basis of results of the analysis to note high frequency of identification of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus haemolyticus in persons without hiv infection and both primary and secondary pyoderma with the further decrease in strains in similar patients with hiv. all patients with pustular skin lesions were found to have a wide spectrum of pathogens prevalence of which depends both on hiv-status of a patient and clinical form of pyoderma. hiv-positive patients with primary pyoderma have a frequency rate of isolation of infectious agents in mixed cultures considerably higher (10 times) than this parameter in hiv-negative patients. the same tendency is observed in the analysis of cultivation rate of pathogens in patients with secondary pyoderma. however, in hiv positive patients the cultivation rate of mixed cultures increases by 2,5 times.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and streptococci from bovine subclinical mastitis cases.
AB  == the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of staphylococci and streptococci were assessed from subclinical mastitis cases. one hundred coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) and 34 streptococci were identified. the most frequently isolated species were staphylococcus haemolyticus (27%) and staphylococcus simulans (24%). susceptible cns species revealed the highest resistance to penicillin g (58%), ampicillin (48%), neomycin (20%), and oleandomycin (14%). cns methicillin resistance rates within 82 isolates were 21.95% and 1.22% by disk diffusion and pcr methods, respectively. these results suggested the disk diffusion method was more prone to yield false positives. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna region from the meca carrying isolate (s. haemolyticus) was homologous with s. haemolyticus sequences/accessions obtained from genbank. however, the meca gene sequence from this isolate was more closely  allied with the s. aureus meca gene of human origins. identical sequence data was acquired from the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) database,  suggesting horizontal gene transfer between the two species. cns beta-lactamase activity within 81 isolates was 29.63%. the most frequently isolated streptococcus species were s. uberis (52%) and s. agalactiae (15%). oleandomycin  was the least effective antimicrobial agent on these isolates with 59% susceptibility. results indicated that cns and streptococci exhibited various antimicrobial resistance responses. consequently, isolation and identification of udder pathogens in herds suffering from subclinical agents is essential to select the most effective antimicrobial agent. moreover, multiple resistance features of methicillin resistant (mr) isolates should be considered during antimicrobial susceptibility tests.

TI  == a pediatric patient with acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by eikenella corrodens.
AB  == a previously healthy 6-year-old boy had continuous fever for 6 days before admission to our hospital. his general condition was good except for pyrexia. the left lobe of the thyroid gland was swollen, red, hot, and tender, and neck movement was limited. the provisional diagnosis was upper respiratory tract infection. we demonstrated the existence of an orifice of the left piriform sinus by esophagography in this case, and made a diagnosis of acute suppurative thyroiditis caused by a piriform sinus fistula in the hypopharynx. the causative  organisms of acute suppurative thyroiditis include peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and alpha-streptococcus, but the organisms responsible are commonly undetectable in clinical cases. we detected eikenella corrodens in the present patient. although eikenella species occasionally causes  acute suppurative thyroiditis in adults, it is rare for this to happen in pediatric patients. antibiotics were administered for 7 days. we also performed aspiration of the abscess on the 8th day of the illness. the abscess was reduced  in size and tenderness was relieved after aspiration. in conclusion, if a pediatric patient has swelling, heat, tenderness, and redness of the anterior neck, we should keep in mind acute suppurative thyroiditis and the possibility of a fistula. if there is an abscess, we should immediately perform aspiration, culture, and isolation, and choose the appropriate antibiotics for the causative  bacteria.

TI  == decontamination efficacy of antiseptic agents on in vivo grown biofilms on rough  titanium surfaces.
AB  == objective: four common antimicrobial agents were evaluated for their efficacy in  reduction of aerobic bacteria intraorally grown in biofilms on rough titanium samples. the solutions investigated contained chlorhexidine, essential oil, octenidine, or citric acid. method and materials: twenty volunteers wore splints  with titanium sleeves intraorally for 10 days. following irrigation with the antiseptics, the sleeves were removed and biofilm samples were taken by swabbing. the bacteria were first examined microscopically by gram staining. these samples  from the surfaces were then cultured under aerobic conditions to identify and quantify the colonizing bacteria. results: compared to untreated controls, significant (p < .05) differences in antimicrobial efficacy were observed for the different regimens depending on bacterial species or even the subtype. the reduction rates achieved varied from 30.0% after 2 minutes of rinsing with chlorhexidine to 99.8% after 8 minutes of rinsing with octenidine. conclusion: the irrigation regimens studied in this investigation reduced bacterial colonization in a mature biofilm grown intraorally on rough titanium surfaces. the highest absolute reduction was achieved after 8 minutes, but only the 2-minute reduction rates are significant for clinical practice. taking this into  consideration, the distinct decontamination efficacy of octenidine and citric acid is evident.

TI  == increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  == in a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10%  fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. in the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter, klebsiella, proteus, streptococcus group b, clostridium difficile, bacillus subtilis and acinetobacter). conclusion: the data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.

TI  == [bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  == introduction: bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. the sooner the diagnosis is  established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. when the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. on the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. it is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. the aim of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. patients and methods: a prospective study was carried out in the paediatric department of the institute from january 1, 1978 to december 31, 2000. patients originated from all parts of yugoslavia. after the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. csf was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by csf culture; 2. elevation of csf leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg  percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the gram stain of csf sediment. in 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. results and discussion: causes of meningitis were as follows: e. coli in 46 newborns (n) (26.5%), streptococcus b haemolyticus group b in 35 n (20.2%), k. pneumoniae in 27 n (15.6%), k. oxytoca in 3 n (1.7%), proteus spp in  14 n (8%), salmonella spp in 12 n, pseudomonas spp in 9 n, streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 n, acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 n, enterobacter spp in 3 n, l. monocytogenes and serratia marcescens and staphylococcus aureus in 2 n each, and in one n. meningitidis, streptococcus group d, citrobacter, morganella morganii and alkaligenes xilosoxidans. over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: e. coli (28.2%), sbhb (26.8%) and klebsiella spp (11.3%). over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: klebsiella spp (26.8%), e. coli (19.2%), sbhb (14.1%), etc. in addition, new causes appeared, namely: morganella morganii, citrobacter, k. oxitoca and alkaligenes xylosoxidans (table 2). of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died:  of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (table 1).  comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (table  2). the explanation might be that the patients came to the institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the  appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. the precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions  where the intensive care units for newborns exist. conclusion: the most frequent  causes of meningitis are the following: e. coli, sbhb and klebsiella pn. frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. new uncommon causes have appeared. the mortality-rate remained very high.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == defective neutrophil oxidative burst in preterm newborns on exposure to coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == the neutrophil oxidative burst is a product of the regulated assembly of the multicomponent oxidase enzyme. our aim was to compare the oxidative burst in term (n = 10) and preterm newborns <31 wk gestational age (n = 10) after stimulation with coagulase-negative staphylococci in vitro. strains of streptococcus epidermidis with different invasive and slime-producing properties, one strain of s. haemolyticus, and one strain of group b-streptococcus were investigated. a whole-blood flow cytometric assay using the oxidation of hydroethidine to ethidium bromide was used. the oxidative activity in unstimulated neutrophil granulocytes [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnls)] was similar in term and preterm newborns, but the preterm newborns showed a significantly lower capacity  to up-regulate the oxidative burst intensity after bacterial stimulation (p = 0.004). in the term but not in the preterm group, the oxidative burst intensity after bacterial stimulation correlated with the baseline oxidative burst intensity. after bacterial stimulation, there was a trend toward a greater percentage of activated neutrophils in the term group than in the preterm group,  but the difference was less pronounced than that in oxidative burst intensity. significant differences in oxidative burst response to different bacterial strains were observed (p < 0.001), but the differences could not be correlated exclusively to invasive capacity or slime-producing properties. it is concluded that the baseline oxidative activity is similar in term and preterm pmnls but that preterm pmnls have a decreased capacity to increase the oxidative burst in response to bacterial stimulation.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == comparability of antimicrobial susceptibility test results from 22 european countries and israel: an external quality assurance exercise of the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) in collaboration with the united kingdom national external quality assurance scheme (uk neqas).
AB  == the goal of this exercise was to organize external quality assurance (qa) of antibiotic susceptibility testing for laboratories participating in earss and to  assess the comparability of susceptibility test results across countries, and guidelines. in september 2000, uk neqas distributed a set of three streptococcus  pneumoniae strains, two staphylococcus aureus strains and one streptococcus haemolyticus strain. laboratories reported the guideline followed, the interpretation of the susceptibility test result and the mic, if tested. in this  study we considered results 'concordant' if the reported interpretation of the participating laboratory agreed with the designated interpretation of reference laboratories. overall, 433 (92%) of 471 laboratories from 23 countries reported back. of the 8685 tests that were assessed, 8322 (96%) were interpreted correctly by the participants. concordance for detection of penicillin non-susceptibility in the three s. pneumoniae strains was 96%, 90% and 87%, respectively. laboratories performed extremely well in detecting oxacillin resistance in the homogeneously methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strain, but the concordance  rate dropped from 100% to 77% in the heterogeneously resistant mrsa strain. concordance for detection of teicoplanin resistance in the s. haemolyticus strain was 82%. we stratified concordance rates first for country and then for guideline used, but observed only minor differences among countries and guidelines. quantitative methods yielding an mic were more concordant than non-mic methods for penicillin resistance in the s. pneumoniae strains (94% versus 79%). the nccls guideline was the most frequently followed, by 61% of laboratories from 19  countries. this exercise shows that, overall, countries participating in earss are capable of delivering susceptibility data of good quality. the comparability  of susceptibility data for penicillin resistance in s. pneumoniae and for homogeneous methicillin resistance in s. aureus is satisfactory among european countries and across guidelines. however, we emphasize the importance of determining an mic for suspected penicillin non-susceptible s. pneumoniae and for suspected glycopeptide non-susceptible s. aureus. laboratories, particularly in some countries, may need to improve their capability to detect oxacillin resistance in heterogeneously resistant mrsa. for continuous external quality assessment we recommend that laboratories participate in national and international schemes with frequent distribution of control strains.

AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == sample preparation of gram-positive bacteria for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight.
AB  == a new sample preparation method was developed for fresh, whole-cell gram-positive bacteria to be analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi tof ms). with fresh, whole-cell gram-negative bacteria of the enterobacteriaceae family, we had previously achieved spectra consisting of >50 peaks and mass ranges of 2-25 kda. because similar spectral quantity could not be achieved for gram-positive bacteria, using this same protocol, we investigated an alternative approach that focuses on the thick peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. gram-positive bacteria were incubated with 0.05-0.5 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min prior to being analyzed by maldi tof ms.  lysozyme is an enzymatically stable, 14-kda protein that specifically cleaves between peptidoglycan disaccharide subunits. a significant increase in overall number of peaks (>50) in the 2-14 kda range was observed without interference from the presence of lysozyme. we show that for four different species (staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, and s. agalactiae) reproducible subset of peaks were found within spectra from a reference strain and two unrelated clinical isolates. the data suggests that this sample preparation may be useful for increasing the overall number of peaks within spectra for subsequent development of bacterial identification strategies.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == in vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == background: monoclonal (mabkt) and recombinant single-chain (scfvkt) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (kt) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, kt-cell wall receptors (ktr), have proven to be killed in vitro by mabkt and scfvkt. mabkt and scfvkt exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against ktr of infecting microorganisms. the swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial  resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mabkt and scfvkt against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. materials and methods: mabkt and scfvkt generated by hybridoma and dna recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a kt-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mab kt4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae strains. these bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. results: according to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mabkt and scfvkt. conclusions: scfvkt exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the uk from october 1996 to january 1997 and october 1997 to january  1998.
AB  == rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 teaching, nine associate teaching and nine district general hospitals) in the uk were compared.  combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in teaching  hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for associate teaching and district  general hospitals rates fell (associate teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; district general 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). using conventional methodology to determine mics, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. for streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). for enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year  1, 15.1% year 2, p = 0.0388). for enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin  and rifampicin.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

TI  == clinical relevance of a european collaborative study on comparative susceptibility of gram-positive clinical isolates to teicoplanin and vancomycin.
AB  == seventy laboratories in nine european countries (belgium, france, germany, italy, the netherlands, portugal, spain, switzerland and the uk) each collected 100 consecutive gram-positive bacterial pathogens during 1995. mics were determined by a co-ordinating laboratory in each country using an agar incorporation method  with mueller hinton medium (nccls). quality control was ensured by distribution of five test strains to the co-ordinating laboratories. a total of 7078 isolates  was collected: 2885 staphylococcus aureus, 1706 enterococci, 1480 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 932 streptococcus spp. (including 289 strains of s. pneumoniae) and 75 miscellaneous species. of these, the country coordinators successfully re-tested 6824 isolates. using nccls interpretive criteria, overall 39 isolates (including 28 strains of enterococci) were teicoplanin-resistant (0.57%) and 38 (mostly cns; 0.56%) were intermediate, whilst 32 isolates (including 30 strains of enterococci) were resistant to vancomycin (0.47%) and 7 (all enterococci; 0.10%) were intermediate. the overall  resistance rate was < or = 0.5%. the two glycopeptides were essentially active against the major pathogens encountered in the survey. the only real difference with clinical implications from previously reported susceptibility data is the emergence and spread of resistance in enterococci, particularly in e. faecium. resistance was highest in ssti, uti, bloodstream and gi infections; no resistance was encountered in rti, gynaecological infections or central nervous system infections. this resistance was also geographically diverse: resistance to vancomycin in e. faecalis was present only in france, germany, italy, portugal and spain (italy and spain only for teicoplanin), whilst resistance to teicoplanin and vancomycin in e. faecium was present in all countries except spain. eight isolates (0.5% of all enterococci) were vancomycin-resistant but teicoplanin-susceptible, exhibiting the vanb phenotype. these were four strains of e. faecalis and four strains of e. faecium. whilst isolates of s. haemolyticus had higher mic of teicoplanin than other cns, and were more susceptible to vancomycin, overall resistance to teicoplanin was low (3.3% in s. haemolyticus; 0.6% in cns). s. haemolyticus was a relatively rare pathogen, accounting for 6.3% of all cns isolates, and 1.4% of all gram-positives collected. the results of this survey show that, despite occasional nosocomial problems (e.g. with enterococci and s. haemolyticus), teicoplanin or vancomycin remain adequate therapy for infections caused by gram-positive pathogens in the 1990s.

TI  == the pattern of micro-organisms and the efficacy of new macrolide in acute lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is one of the major health problems in developing countries such as indonesia. according to the national household health survey conducted by the ministry of health in 1992, lrtis still rank fourth as the main cause of death in indonesia. the problem of lrtis could be simply managed as long as the causative organism can be identified and the proper antibiotic known. in some occasions, it is not quite so easy to identify the causative micro-organism, especially in lower tract infections. there are several methods of obtaining specimens from lrtis for cultures. the easiest, most simple  way is to collect expectorated sputum. unfortunately, because of the high rate of contamination by upper respiratory tract flora, this method is not reliable. recognizing the difficulties with routine expectorated sputum cultures, two alternative approaches have been suggested. one approach is to bypass potential expectorated sputum 'contaminants' in the oropharynx by transtracheal aspiration  or transthoracic aspiration. the second approach is to modify the usual technique of processing expectorated sputum by either washing techniques or by quantitative cultures. azithromycin and clarithromycin are chemically related to macrolide erithromycin. both antibiotics retain the traditional macrolide spectrum of activity against gram-positive and atypical pneumonia pathogens, while demonstrating improved activity against gram-negative bacteria. the american thoracic society (ats) recommended the use of macrolide for outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia, without comorbidity and 60 years of age or younger. a total of 34 outpatients with acute lrtis were open-comparative, randomly allocated to treatment with the new macrolide in persahabatan hospital, jakarta,  1996. the purposes of this study were: (i) to identify the causative micro-organisms; and (ii) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the new macrolide  in these infections. azithromycin 500 mg was given orally once a day for 3 days and was administered 1 h before or 2 h after every meal. clarithromycin 500 mg was given orally every 12 h for 10 days. the diagnosis of the patients were: 16 with pneumonia, 10 with acute bronchitis and 8 with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. in this study of 34 patients, the sputum specimens were washed with n acetylcysteine before culture and we could only detect micro-organisms in one patient. before treatment, we found 47 strains in 33 (97.05%) patients and after  treatment we found five strains. from serological examination, only four (11.76%) atypical bacterial were detected. the most frequently found microorganisms were 23 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae (40.42%), 10 of streptococcus alpha haemolyticus (21.26%), five of streptococcus pneumoniae (10.63%) and five of staphylococcus aureus (10.63%). the atypical bacterial were: two legionella pneumophila, one mycoplasma pneumoniae and one chlamydia pneumoniae. the clinical efficacy of new macrolides were 100% and the bacteriological responses with eradication of 94.12% vs 70.59% of isolates in the azithromycin and clarithromycin groups are shown in table 1. there were no adverse reactions detected in the two treatment groups until the end of the study.

TI  == molecular cloning of a 32-kilodalton lipoprotein component of a novel iron-regulated staphylococcus epidermidis abc transporter.
AB  == our previous studies identified two iron-regulated cytoplasmic membrane proteins  of 32 and 36 kda expressed by both staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus  aureus. in this study we show by triton x-114 phase partitioning and tritiated palmitic acid labelling that these proteins are lipoproteins which are anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane by their lipid-modified n termini. in common with those of some other gram-positive bacteria, these highly immunogenic lipoproteins were released from the bacterial cell into the culture supernatants, with release being promoted by growth of the bacteria under iron-restricted conditions. immunoelectron microscopy with a monospecific rabbit antiserum to the 32-kda s. epidermidis lipoprotein showed that the majority of the antigen was distributed throughout the staphylococcal cell wall. only minor quantities were detected in the cytoplasmic membrane, and exposure of the lipoprotein on the bacterial surface was minimal. a monoclonal antibody raised to the 32-kda lipoprotein of s. aureus was used in immunoblotting studies to investigate the conservation of this antigen among a variety of staphylococci. the monoclonal antibody reacted with polypeptides of 32 kda in s. epidermidis and s. aureus and of 40 kda in staphylococcus hominis. no reactivity was detected with staphylococcus lugdunensis, staphylococcus cohni, or staphylococcus haemolyticus. the gene encoding the 32-kda lipoprotein from s. epidermidis has been isolated from a lambda zap ii genomic dna library and found to be a component of an iron-regulated operon encoding a novel abc-type transporter. the operon contains  three genes, designated sita, -b, and -c, encoding an atpase, a cytoplasmic membrane protein, and the 32-kda lipoprotein, respectively. sitc shows significant homology both with a number of bacterial adhesins, including fima of  streptococcus parasanguis and scaa of streptococcus gordonii, and with lipoproteins of a recently described family of abc transporters with proven or putative metal ion transport functions. although the solute specificity of this novel transporter has not yet been determined, we speculate that it may be involved in either siderophore- or transferrin-mediated iron uptake in s. epidermidis.

AB  == avoparcin is a glycopeptide antimicrobial that is widely used as a growth promoter in animal feeds in portions of western europe. recently, concern has emerged about the possible contribution of avoparcin use to the emergence of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. relatively little information exists on the spectrum of activity and potency of avoparcin. we studied the activity of avoparcin compared to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and 3 other antimicrobials against 814 recent human clinical isolates, including staphylococcus spp. (240 strains),  streptococcus spp. (90 strains), and enterococcus spp. (60 strains), using reference susceptibility test methods. our results indicate that avoparcin was less potent than either vancomycin or teichoplanin against staphylococci (mic50,  4 micrograms/ ml). there was a good correlation of avoparcin mics with the mics for vancomycin and teichoplanin for most species; however, the avoparcin mics for enterococcus spp. of the vanb phenotype were quite variable (mic range, 2 to > 16 micrograms/ml). for staphylococcus haemolyticus, high avoparcin mics (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) were associated with oxacillin resistance. these results are relevant to the debate concerning the appropriateness of continued use of avoparcin as a growth promoter in animal husbandry. in particular, avoparcin as a glycopeptide with limited potency against some staphylococci seems to represent a theoretically greater risk for selecting glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, but may not represent any greater threat for the selection of resistance in enterococci.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of ly333328, a new semisynthetic glycopeptide.
AB  == ly333328 is a semisynthetic n-alkyl derivative of ly264826, a naturally occurring structural analog of vancomycin. ly333328 was evaluated for its in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities in comparison with those of the two currently available glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin). glycopeptide-susceptible test strains included a total of 311 isolates (most of clinical origin) from the genera staphylococcus, enterococcus, streptococcus, aerococcus, gemella, lactococcus, listeria, corynebacterium, and clostridium. test strains resistant or intermediate to vancomycin and/or teicoplanin included  56 clinical isolates of enterococcus (of the vana, vanb, and vanc phenotypes) and 32 clinical isolates of staphylococcus (s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus), 31 strains of gram-positive genera outside the spectrum of activity of vancomycin (leuconostoc, pediococcus, lactobacillus, and erysipelothrix), and laboratory-derived organisms obtained after exposure of susceptible staphylococcus isolates to teicoplanin (6 strains) or laboratory-derived organisms with resistance determinants received from vana enterococci (2 enterococcus and 25 listeria transconjugants). ly333328 was highly active against staphylococci, enterococci, and listeriae (whether they were clinical or laboratory-derived strains) resistant to the currently available glycopeptides. in particular, the mics of ly333328 did not vary substantially between teicoplanin-susceptible and teicoplanin-resistant staphylococci and between vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ly333328 demonstrated fairly good inhibitory activity even against most strains of leuconostoc, pediococcus, and erysipelothrix (mic range, 1 to 8 microg/ml), whereas it proved less active (although much more active than vancomycin or teicoplanin) against lactobacillus strains. in minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) and time-kill studies, ly333328 demonstrated excellent bactericidal activity; enterococci, in particular, which were largely tolerant of vancomycin and teicoplanin, were uniformly killed by ly333328, with mbc-to-mic ratios of 4 to 8 for most vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant strains. in attempts to select for resistant clones, no survivors stably growing in the presence of 10 microg of ly333328 per ml were obtained from the staphylococcus and enterococcus test strains exposed to the drug.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s)  of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold  more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.

TI  == [a new device for the disinfection of handpieces and turbines].
AB  == dental handpieces are often difficult to disinfect. this is one of the main reasons for the considerable risk of cross-infections in dental offices. the aim  of the present study was the evaluation of the disinfectant property of a recent, commercially available, automatic instrument, described as capable to clean, disinfect and lubricate dental handpieces. the following experimental evaluations were made: 1) antimicrobial activity of the disinfectant (glyoxalaldehyde) used.  the method described by the european committee for standardization was followed.  test microorganisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. 2) disinfection of dental handpieces (69 contra-angles and 97 turbines of different  marks). they were naturally infected using them on patients for 30 minutes at least. 3) disinfection of dental handpieces infected with bacterial suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes (beta-haemolyticus, group a), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the results of the first experiment  showed a strong bactericidal power of the disinfectant with both the tested strains, after a contact time of only 1 minute. a great proportion of the dental  handpieces tested during the second experiment were found disinfected: from 84% through 89% out of the various models of turbine handpieces; from 89% through 100% out of the models of contra-angle handpieces. even though bacterial contamination level was low (about 10(3) microorganisms per handpiece), a satisfactory disinfectant ability in natural conditions was found. the results of the third experiment were unclear. the tested instrument reduced 10(5)-10(8) times the original bacterial count when the gram positive microorganisms (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes) were used. on the other hand, when pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans were used, the results were different: the bacterial count was reduced 10(6)-10(7) times in some cases, and only 10(2) times in other cases. this difference was found in the tests made using the same attachment and in those made using various attachments. in conclusion, the tested instrument showed, in most cases, a good disinfectant property, but the presence of unclear results suggests that some technical modifications are required.

TI  == the effect of antiseptic solutions on microorganisms in venous leg ulcers.
AB  == the effect on the microbial ulcer flora of wet gauze dressings soaked in antiseptic solutions used for desloughing leg ulcers is not known. quantitative cultures were therefore performed in 45 venous leg ulcers, before application and after 15 minutes' treatment with gauze dressings with four different antiseptic solutions: aluminium acetotartrate (alsol) 1%, potassium permanganate 0.015%, acetic acid 0.25% and chloramine 0.25%. the percentage of ulcers with each type of microorganism did not differ before and after application of the antiseptic solutions. staphylococcus aureus was found in 79% of the ulcers, gram-negative rods in 39%, s. epidermidis in 21%, proteus spp in 21%, pseudomonas spp in 14% and fungi in none. potassium permanganate reduced the mean number of bacteria per ulcer from 4.4 x 10(6) to 0.9 x 10(6) (ns), chloramine from 2.7 x 10(6) to 2.2 x  10(6) (ns), alsol from 1.2 x 10(7) to 3.5 x 10(6) (ns) and acetic acid from 6.3 x 10(6) to 2.6 x 10(5) (p = 0.007). s. aureus was reduced by acetic acid (p = 0.002), gram-negative rods by both chloramine (p = 0.03) and acetic acid (p = 0.03). the number of pseudomonas, proteus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus group g was not reduced significantly (p > 0.05) by any of the solutions.

TI  == [method of dna extraction and meca, fema and pbp2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

TI  == in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin against gram-positive bacteria from human clinical and veterinary sources.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of teicoplanin and vancomycin was determined by the agar dilution method for 186 gram-positive bacteria from human  clinical and veterinary sources. teicoplanin mic values were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml for 94% of staphylococci (group a, n = 52) and less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml for all streptococci, enterococci, aerococci and pediococci (group b, n = 75). seventy-eight percent of gram-positive rods, rhodococcus and leuconostoc spp. (group c, n = 59) were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml. teicoplanin resistance (mic greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) was demonstrated for all nocardia strains and for some strains of  lactobacillus, e. rhusiopathiae, leuconostoc, and s. haemolyticus. cross-resistance between teicoplanin and vancomycin was observed for all nocardia strains and for some strains of lactobacillus, e. rhusiopathiae, and leuconostoc. three methicillin-resistant s. haemolyticus strains were either resistant or intermediately susceptible to teicoplanin and susceptible to vancomycin. eight strains (motile enterococci four, e. rhusiopathiae three and leuconostoc sp. one) were susceptible to teicoplanin and resistant to vancomycin. teicoplanin disc diffusion on danish blood agar with neosensitabs (rosco), pdm ab biodisc and locally prepared discs revealed a wide range of zone diameters in groups b and c. the relation between mic values and zone diameters for teicoplanin was analysed by the error-rate bounded method. zone size interpretive criteria as suggested by the manufacturers (greater than or equal to 15 mm) produced 2.7% (95% confidence  limits 0.9-6.2%) and 1.6% (95% confidence limits 0.3-4.6%) very major errors for  neosensitabs and pdm-disc, respectively. using a zone size breakpoint for susceptibility of greater than or equal to 25 mm for neosensitabs and greater than or equal to 20 mm for pdm-disc, the proportions of very major errors were 0.5% (95% confidence limits 0.0-3.0%) at the expense of 5.9% (95% confidence limits 3.0-10.3%) indeterminate strains that belonged to e. rhusiopathiae, leuconostoc, lactobacillus and s. haemolyticus. however, using these zone size breakpoints five major errors (beta-haemolytic streptococci, group b three, s. aureus one, leuconostoc sp. one) were observed for neosensitabs and two major errors (beta-haemolytic streptococcus, group b one, leuconostoc sp. one) were observed for pdm-disc. susceptibility testing against teicoplanin among these taxa should therefore include a determination of mic.

AB  == from the genotoxic viewpoint, there exists a sufficient evidence for asbestos carcinogenicity to human population and animals. asbestos is a solid cancer promoter (cocarcinogen) of non-mutagenic character having epigenetic effects (15, 16). no data have been published on its mutagenic activity in "in vivo" conditions in man. the only results are those of our pilot study carried out in the period of 1981-1983, which cast doubts on the official view of non-mutagenic  character of asbestos--at least under occupational conditions of its processing (34, 36, 37). the study presented here represents ten years' efforts made in the  biological (cytogenetic) monitoring of persons occupationally exposed to asbestos in a factory for its processing (occupational risk). simultaneously, a preliminary answer is given to the question whether the osinek factory (situated  in a housing area) is or is not dangerous for inhabitants of the town of kostelec nad orlici, namely for their genetic apparatus (environmental risk). using the method of chromosome aberrations analysis in peripheral blood lymphocytes, a total of 431 subjects (245 males and 186 females) were examined in the period of  1981 to 1988. of these, 111 persons were from control workplaces (from osinek or--starting from 1984--from other plants in kostelec nad orlici; in addition to  that 14 pensioners without any occupational exposure were examined). the average  age of workers exposed to asbestos risk was 42.7 years, in the controls it was 43.9 years, in pensioners exposed to asbestos earlier 63.5 years and in those never exposed to asbestos 66.5 years. the average number of years spent at osinek factory amounted to 21.5 years. about one third of employees were found to suffer from allergies (first of all those of air passages) and one sixth from chronic ailments of the upper air passages (staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus beta-haemolyticus were diagnosed most frequently). a third part of workers from high-risk workshops are smokers, only a fourth of the controls. about 40% of workers regularly consume alcoholic drinks. the average morbidity rate at osinek in 1981 to 1988 was 6.3% (in workers as high as 9%), which is about 2% higher as compared with mean values obtained in the district of rychnov  nad kneznou and east-bohemian region. within the nine-year period (1981-1989), 21 occupational diseases were diagnosed, while in the previous 24 years there were 24 cases of an occupational disease. earlier they were mainly asbestoses (87%), in the last period mainly cancer diseases coinciding with asbestosis (81%).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  == a total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of  3 g/die by intramuscular route. pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject  (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. in vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to sa and 7 (16%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. in patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: e. coli in 40 cases, s. albus in 16 cases, proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, streptococcus faecalis in 3  cases, streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases.  in vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == treatment of posttraumatic osteitis with intravenous ofloxacin.
AB  == the subjects were 25 patients with osteomyelitis (n = 17) or other bone or joint  infections, scheduled for surgical procedures, including debridement, sequestrectomy, and bone resection and reconstruction. staphylococcus aureus was  isolated in 22 patients, staphylococcus epidermidis in one, streptococcus haemolyticus in one, pseudomonas aeruginosa in one, and a pasteurella species in  one. during surgery and for a mean of four days after surgery, each patient received 200 mg of ofloxacin intravenously twice daily (one patient received 300  mg and another received 400 mg twice daily). the patients were then given 200 mg  of ofloxacin orally twice daily until the wound was healed (after a mean of 18 days). the wound was healed in all patients and no cases of reinfection occurred. it is concluded that intravenous ofloxacin given perioperatively may be more effective than oral ofloxacin in the management of osteomyelitis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin against united states teicoplanin clinical trial isolates of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == in this study, the in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin was directly compared against 503 gram-positive cocci isolated during the u.s. teicoplanin clinical trials. both antibiotics were equally active against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-sensitive and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, except staphylococcus haemolyticus. teicoplanin was fourfold more active than vancomycin against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 0.5 vs. 2.0 micrograms/ml), whereas vancomycin was more active than teicoplanin (mic90, 2.0 vs. 8.0 micrograms/ml) against oxacillin-resistant s. haemolyticus. teicoplanin was two- to eightfold more active than vancomycin against the streptococci and enterococci tested.

TI  == in-vitro postantibiotic effects of miocamycin and erythromycin on gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the capability of miocamycin to induce a postantibiotic effect (pae) on a group a streptococcus beta-haemolyticus clinical isolate and on staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 has been studied. erythromycin was chosen as a reference molecule. the exposure time to antibiotics was 90 min. the removal technique of the antibiotic  agents consisted of a 1:200 dilution in cultural broth. miocamycin displayed a pae of 2 h 30 min in relation to the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of streptococcus and a pae of 2 h 30 min in relation to the mic of staphylococcus. the pae value lasting longer than the others was of 5 h 40 min towards streptococcus and of 4 h 18 min towards staphylococcus at a concentration eightfold the mic. erythromycin showed a pae of 1 h 36 min in relation to the mic of streptococcus and a pae of 1 h 30 min in relation to the mic of staphylococcus. the pae value lasting longer than the others was of 3 h 15 min against streptococcus and of 2 h 30 min against staphylococcus at a concentration eightfold the mic. in some cases a pae was observed in relation to subinhibitory  concentrations (1/2 mic). miocamycin therefore proved to possess a more evident capability to induce a pae against the clinical isolate of group a streptococcus  beta-haemolyticus and on staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 than did erythromycin.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == [the use of teicoplanin in neutropenic patients: values and limits].
AB  == the efficacy and the safety of teicoplanin were evaluated for the treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. a total of 18 patients received teicoplanin once daily as an intravenous injection of 200 mg in 6 patients (after a loading dose of 400 mg) or 400 mg in 12 patients (loading dose: 800 mg). the mean duration of therapy was 15.9 days (range 9 to 39 days). in all patients teicoplanin was combined with another antibiotic usually a beta-lactam. thirteen  of 18 patients were successfully treated. three febrile episodes proved to be microbiologically documented infections and were cured by teicoplanin: one streptococcus mitis and two methicillin-resistant (methi-r) staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremias. neither toxicity nor side effects were observed in the reported group. six patients experiencing reactions to vancomycin (2 cases of cutaneous allergy) or to vancomycin and amphotericin b combination (4 cases of nephrotoxicity) were subsequently treated with teicoplanin without any evidence of cross-sensitivity. we observed emergence of teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 3 patients receiving teicoplanin: 20, 18 and 8 days after a first febrile episode cured by teicoplanin and a beta-lactam, they developed fever while receiving the same antibiotic regimen. methi-r staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from blood cultures in the first patient  and methi-r staphylococcus haemolyticus in the two other patients. in one patient, successfully treated by teicoplanin for a first febrile episode related  to a methi-r staphylococcus epidermidis, emergence of staphylococcus haemolyticus occurred 8 days later while the patient was on teicoplanin therapy (6 mg/kg). mics of teicoplanin were 16 mg/l for the two staphylococcus strains isolated in this patient.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == oral ciprofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  == the clinical efficacy and tolerability of ciprofloxacin orally administered at the dosage of 250 mg twice a day was evaluated in 25 patients affected by acute bacterial pharyngotonsillitis. all patients were non-responders to previous conventional antibiotic therapies due to in vitro resistance of the responsible bacteria, or possibly the low antibiotic concentration at the infection site. none of the patients had infections caused by group a beta-haemolyticus streptococcus. treatment with ciprofloxacin lasted for 5-10 days (mean 6.7). a favorable clinical response was observed in 92% of patients (15 resolutions and 7 improvements) at the end of the therapy and two weeks later (follow-up). one patient was not evaluable because of the unfortunate onset of glossitis that caused the interruption of the treatment. no other side-effects were recorded in  the other 24 patients. the bacteriological response was excellent: 83% bacteriological eradication, 13% persistence and super-infection in only one patient (4%). ciprofloxacin administered orally at low dosages is highly effective in the treatment of bacterial pharyngotonsillitis and is also well tolerated.

TI  == bacteria causing respiratory infections in children and their sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  == the author lists the most frequent bacterial agents isolated from the nose and pharynx samples of children that visited the child health centre from 1983 to 1986. the gram-positive bacteria found most often were: staphylococcus aureus (44% in 1983, 40% in 1986). streptococcus pneumoniae (6% in 1983, 12% in 1986), and streptococcus haemolyticus of group "a" (14% in 1983, 19% in 1986). the isolated gram-negative bacteria were: e. coli (14%), klebsiella enterobacter (8%), and proteus species and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 to 4% [4, 6, 7, 16]). according to the author's analyses staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to cloxacilline (96%, no changes in the 4-year period), then to sulphametoxasol-trimetropin (95%), to lincomycine (85% no change), while to penicillin it is entirely resistant. streptococcus pneumoniae proved sensitive to ampicillin, lincocine and erythromycin (96%), to cephalosporins (83%) and to sulphamides (85%). streptococcus haemolyticus from group "a" reacted to penicillin excellently. the greatest sensitivity to gram-negative bacteria e. coli related to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (96%), chloramphenicol (91%), and to cephalosporines (90%, in 1986 only 60%). klebsiella enterobacter reacted to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (92%) and chloramphenicol (83%) and pseudomonas to aminoglycosides (95%), gentamycin (92%), while to cephalosporines and ampicillin preparations it proved totally resistant.

TI  == the bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  == the origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. to overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol nh3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora  was ureolytic. after their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of streptococcus salivarius, one streptococcus bovis, two staphylococcus epidermidis and three staphylococcus haemolyticus. their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. the  mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. however, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected strep. salivarius, and staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol nh3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. thus urea  metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from staph. epidermidis. the presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

AB  == immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hcg), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the cooh-terminal peptide of hcg beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hcg beta, demonstrated expression of hcg-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as streptococcus faecalis (three strains), staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (single strains). the other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (cwd) variants,  one identified as streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with  a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. the other was a gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a gram-positive corynebacterium identified as a 'c. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hcg-like factor only during its phase as gram-negative diphtheroid. electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hcg-like material including the two cwd variants. collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hcg-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic  hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hcg molecule.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == fresh isolates of 204 strains of streptococcus haemolyticus, 75 strains of viridans group streptococcus, and 45 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae were studied for their clumping reactions with human plasma. the plasma and serum factors that clumped the streptococcal strains were compared with those that clumped a staphylococcus aureus strain. one hundred eleven strains of s. haemolyticus, 10 strains of viridans group streptococcus, and none of the strains of s. pneumoniae tested were clumped by human plasma. however, clumping activity  was remarkably unstable after subculturing on plates containing todd-hewitt blood agar. the strain with the highest level of activity was clumped by fibrinogen and normal human serum. results of tests of the clumping reactions of staphylococci and streptococci with human serum indicated that the serum factors responsible for those reactions may be identical.

TI  == [the antibacterial activity of diphenhydramine (author's transl)].
AB  == diphenhydramine (n,n-dimethyl-2-diphenyl-methoxy-ethylamine) [n,n-dimethyl-2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethylamin] (dph) is a well-known local anaesthetic and an antagonist of both acetylcholine and histamine. we tested its  antibacterial efficacy by means of three different investigation methods, i.e. microcalorimetry, continuous density measurement and the microdilution test to find out the mic of this compound against various bacteria. dph inhibits the growth of e. coli and klebsiella strains at a concentration of 0.18% of staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus at 0.37%, of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 0.75% and streptococcus faecalis strains at 1.5%. the results of microcalorimetry and continous density measurements showed that the addition of 0.2% dph to a broth with growing bacteria interferes very quickly with cell metabolism and stops further reproduction. the microcalorimetric findings were carried out with staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus strain no. 13,665 an- the e. coli strain no. 3579.

TI  == [resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections (author's transl)].
AB  == the present status of resistance to antibiotics of bacteria involved in respiratory infections is reviewed. schematically it can outlined as follows. streptococcus b-haemolyticus as well as pneumococcus did not change their sensitivity to penicillin, but some strains are now resistant to tetracycline. streptococcus viridans, enterococcus and h. influenzae did not change substantially their sensitivity to antibiotics. staphylococcus aureus is the bacterial species that always poses some problems with regard to antibiotic resistance. due to the selection of strains penicillinase-producing because of the large use of penicillin, the most part of clinical isolates of staphylococci  is now resistant to penicillin. in addition an increased number of strains resistant to the other antibiotics has been registered as soon as they has been introduced in therapy. the resistant strains spread in a particularly rapid way in hospital. the introduction in therapy of penicillinase-resistant penicillins constituted a remarkable advance in therapy of staphylococcal infection. however, there is now a growing number of indications about the emergence of methicillin resistant strains of staphylococci. on the other hand it must be recalled that since 1960 a marked reduction of incidence and mortality in severe staphylococcal infections has been noted. incidence and mortality of respiratory infections due  to gram-negative bacilli is augmented particularly in connection with a larger use of immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies, of particular surgical or  reanimation procedures, of intensive courses of antibiotic therapy etc. emergence of pseudomonas, proteus, serratia, providencia, etc. infections poses many difficult problems of chemotherapy since these species are scarcely sensitive to  antibiotics. carbenicillin, cephalosporins, sisomicin, tobramycin, amikacin are the more recent drugs that alone or in combination may offer some chances of success in this field.

TI  == endophthalmitis following cataract extraction. a study of 24 cases in 4,498 operations.
AB  == the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis in a series of 4,498 consecutive cataract operations, performed in a period of 10 years, was examined and found to equal 0.533%. paracentesis of the anterior chamber was done in two cases and revealed staphylococcus albus to be the causative organism in both instances. conjunctival cultures were recovered in a further 17 cases, and showed s. albus in pure culture in eight cases and in combination with pseudomonas aeruginosa and proteous morgani in two cases. streptococcus haemolyticus was isolated in pure culture in one case, while the cultures from six other patients were negative. the role of such factors as age, diabetes mellitus, chronic bronchitis, "weak ocular tissue", and persurgical complications which predisposed to postoperative  infections was examined and found to have no significance on the occurrence of endophthalmitis in the present study. the visual end results were assessed and showed a better prognosis than generally expected. of 24 cases, five achieved good visual acuity (6/6-6/12), 13 had a useful vision (6/18-6/60), while five remained actually blind (less than 6/60). in only one case was the eye enucleated. methods of treatment and prophylaxis are described and discussed. a total suppression or elimination of all regional bacteria at the time of surgery  seems to be the logical goal.

AB  == in experimental in vivo tests the therapeutic effect of gentamicin added to palacos is detected in a standardized osteomyelitic infection caused by staph. aureus haemolyticus. the number of germ populations is reduced significantly by the antibiotic which is released in a microbiologically active concentration. on  the other hand the number of germ populations in control trials (without adding an antibiotic) is remaining on a high level. during the time of the tests the appearance of other bacterial is registrated.

TI  == antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus.
AB  == the antimicrobial property of human uterine cervical mucus was tested in three groups of women. healthy women, using no contraception, women using an intrauterine device and women receiving hormonal treatment for contraception. cervical mucus was taken on the 10th, 14th, 18th and 22nd day of the menstrual cycle. cervical mucus had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of micrococcus lysodeicticus in all three groups. the strength of the inhibitory effect on the other microorganisms were in the following order: staphylococcus albus, staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, streptococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus faecalis. use of an intrauterine device did not affect the antimicrobial effect of cervical mucus. the use of hormonal contraceptive canceled the antimicrobial effect on the series of microorganisms,  with the exception of m. lysodeicticus. the maximum inhibitory effect occurred on the 14th day and declined toward the end of the menstrual cycle.

TI  == bacteriology and clinical significance of hemolytic haemophilus in the throat.
AB  == hemolytic haemophilus are rarely isolated in the clinical laboratory, as they do  not grow on sheep or human blood-agar alone. on rabbit blood-agar they grow well  and are hemolytic, but they grow less well and are not hemolytic on sheep blood-agar with added x and v factors. a survey was made to determine their incidence in pharyngitis. from 28 of 100 sore throats and from 57 of 100 normal throats, only normal bacterial flora were isolated. beta-streptococci were present in significant numbers in 9 sore and 11 normal throats; staphylococci in  8 sore and 4 normal throats; pneumococci in 20 sore and 11 normal throats; h. influenzae or h. parainfluenzae in 13 sore and no normal throats; hemolytic haemophilus in 30 sore and 18 normal throats; enteric bacilli in 1 of each; candida and neisseria in 2 sore throats each. all of the 33 hemolytic haemophilus isolates identified to species were h. parahaemolyticus. all were sensitive in vitro to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline; 30 were sensitive to ampicillin and 30 to penicillin, 26 to novobiocin, and 12 to methicillin. h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, and h. haemolyticus are indistinguishable by gram  stain morphology, but h. parahaemolyticus is larger than the other three. hemolytic and nonhemolytic species are indistinguishable by colonial morphology or by nutritional requirements; only hemolysis gives positive differentiation. nevertheless, only rarely would this be of clinical importance. h. parahaemolyticus apparently may cause pharyngitis, but it is almost always susceptible to penicillin and rarely if ever causes sequelae.

TI  == the occurrence of peroxide in cultures of pneumococcus.
AB  == 1. conditions which favor the formation and accumulation of peroxide in broth cultures of pneumococcus are free access of air, and the absence of catalase, peroxidase, and other catalysts capable of decomposing this compound. under these favorable conditions peroxide becomes demonstrable in the culture fluid during the logarithmic phase of growth and persists for a period of at least 6 to 12 days. 2. in the absence of these favorable conditions the formation of peroxide is inhibited. in a culture with deficient oxygen exposure the accumulation of peroxide is delayed; when anaerobic conditions are maintained the substance is not formed. in the presence of active catalysts, peroxide does not accumulate in  the medium in quantities sufficient to give a positive reaction. the accumulation of peroxide in pneumococcus cultures is dependent upon the balance between the amount produced by the microorganisms and the amount destroyed by substances in the medium. 3. the peroxide formed in pneumococcus cultures is unstable. it gradually disappears during prolonged incubation at 37 degrees c.; it is less stable in alkaline than in neutral or acid media. it is destroyed in culture filtrates exposed to the temperature of boiling water for 15 minutes, and to that of steam under pressure (15 pounds) for 10 minutes. 4. peroxide formation occurred early in broth cultures of the seven strains of pneumococcus and of the  six strains of non-hemolytic streptococci studied. fifteen of twenty-three strains of streptococcus haemolyticus and one of three strains of streptococcus mucosus formed peroxide. in the positively reacting cultures of streptococcus haemolyticus and streptococcus mucosus the presence of peroxide was not demonstrable until the 3rd to 5th day of incubation. peroxide could not be detected at any time during growth of the two strains of staphylococcus aureus.
