TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == substrate profiling of finegoldia magna sufa protease, inhibitor screening and application to prevent human fibrinogen degradation and bacteria growth in vitro.
AB  == sufa, which belongs to the subtilisin-like serine protease family, contains a non-canonical asp-his-ser catalytic triad. under in vitro conditions, sufa is capable of human fibrinogen hydrolysis leading to inhibition of fibrin network formation, thus suggesting its important role in the development and progression  of finegoldia magna infections. in addition, it has been demonstrated that sufa can hydrolyze antibacterial peptides such as ll-37 and the chemokine mig/cxcl 9,  hence evading host defence mechanisms. although the sufa protease from f. magna was discovered several years ago, its optimal substrate preference has not yet been identified. considering the role of sufa, we have focused on the profiling of its substrate sequence preference spanning s1-s3 binding pockets using the fret (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) approach. next, based on the structure of the p1 residue of the developed substrate, we narrowed the inhibitor screening to the phosphonic analogues of amino acids containing an arginine-like  side chain. among all the compounds tested, only cbz-6-amnphth(p)(oph)2 showed any inhibitory activity against sufa displaying k2/ki value of 10,800 m(-1) s(-1). in addition, it prevented sufa-mediated human fibrinogen hydrolysis in vitro and exhibited potent antibacterial activity against f. magna, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. herein, we report on the substrate specificity, synthesis and kinetic evaluation of phosphonic inhibitors of sufa protease from f. magna which could help to establish its function in pathogenesis development and may lead to the elaboration of new antibacterial drugs.

TI  == an in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
AB  == preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (sa) and silver carboxymethylcellulose  (scm) dressings. an- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (czoi) as- says. antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (clsm). log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for staphylococcus aureus ncimb 9518, candida albicans atcc 90028, finegoldia magna nctc 11804t, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa nctc 10662. log10 reduction was higher for scm than sa dressing-exposed escherichia coli (p = 0.035) and p. aeruginosa atcc 15692 (p = 0.032), and lower for scm than sa dressing-exposed streptococcus pyogenes (p = 0.007), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (p = 0.045), and s. aureus nctc 8325 (p =  0.012). both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the czoi assay. sa dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer  than scm activity when exposed to c. albicans (9 days' activity), e. coli (7 days' activity), f. magna (5 days' activity), and p. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the smc exhibited greater persistence against s. pyogenes (13  days' activity). clsm showed complete kill of s. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. the results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == we studied the serum bactericidal activity (sba) of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against common pathogens associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections.  ten healthy volunteers received a single dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg) and levofloxacin (750 mg) and serum samples were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24h after the dose of each drug. bactericidal titers in serum over time were determined for aerobic gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebseilla pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae) and anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella bivia, and finegoldia magna).  both fluoroquinolones provided rapid (2h) attainment and prolonged (24h) sba (titers > or = 1:8) against each of the aerobic bacilli studied. sba was observed for at least 12h against b. fragilis strains with mics < or = 2 microg/ml to moxifloxacin and < or = 4 microg/ml to levofloxacin. prolonged (12h) sba (titers  > or = 1:2) was also observed against isolates of b. thetaiotaomicron, p. bivia,  and f. magna with moxifloxacin < or = mics 2 microg/ml.
