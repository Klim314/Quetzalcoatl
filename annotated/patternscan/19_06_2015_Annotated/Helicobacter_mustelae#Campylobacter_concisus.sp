TI  == [detection of pyrazinamidase activity for differentiation of campylobacter, arcobacter, and helicobacter spp. by using a high-performance liquid chromatography method].
AB  == a high-performance liquid chromatography method was investigated for the detection pyrazinamidase activity by campylobacter, arcobacter, and helicobacter  spp. pyrazine carboxilic acid, one of the end products of pyrazinamide hydrolysis by microorganisms, was detected by using a high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). a loopful of organism colonies was emulsified in 0.5 ml of a 0.5% pyrazinamide solution. the suspens on was incubated in a 37 degrees c water bath  for 18-20 hr. after centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by hplc. this hplc method does not require microaerobic incubation and was easy to interpret for strains with weak enzymatic activity. by this method, we tested 111 clinical  isolates, type and reference strains of campylobacter spp., arcobacter spp., and  helicobacter spp. , c. jejuni, c. jejuni subsp. doylei, c. coli, c. upsaliensis,  c. lari, c. lari (urease+), c. helveticus, c. hyolei, c. sputorum subsp. fecalis, c. gracilis, c. concisus, c. curvus were positive for pyrazinamidase. c. fetus subsp. fetus, c. hyointestinalis, c. sputorum subsp. sputorum, c. sputorum subsp. bubulus, c. mucosalis, a. butzleri, a. skirrowii, a. cryaerophilus, h. pylori, h. cinaedi, h. fennelliae, h. mustelae, h. felis, h. muridarum, h. canis, h. nemestrinae, h. pamentensis, h. pullourum were negative.

TI  == helicobacter acinonyx sp. nov., isolated from cheetahs with gastritis.
AB  == four strains of a novel helicobacter species were isolated from the stomachs of cheetahs (acinonyx jubilatus) with gastritis. these isolates were phenotypically  similar to helicobacter pylori. the isolates were gram-negative, spiral bacteria  which grew under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees c, but not at 25 or 42  degrees c, and produced urease, catalase, oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. the isolates did not ferment glucose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin, or arabinose; hydrolyze hippurate or indoxyl acetate; or reduce nitrate. they did not produce h2s from triple sugar iron agar, and they did not grow in the presence of 1.0% glycine or 1.5% nacl. they were resistant to nalidixic acid and sensitive to cephalothin and metronidazole. cells were typically 0.3 by 2.0 microns and possessed tufts of two to five sheathed, monopolar flagella. the g+c content of strain 90-119 was 30 mol%. cluster analysis of densitometry scans of polyacrylamide protein gels revealed more than 70% similarity of the cheetah isolates to h. pylori, less than 60% similarity to helicobacter felis, and less than 50% similarity to helicobacter mustelae. complete 16s rrna sequences were determined for two of the cheetah isolates. phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the cheetah sequences to those of 19 reference strains, including h. pylori, h. felis (two strains), h. mustelae, helicobacter muridarum, "flexispira  rappini," wolinella succinogenes, campylobacter coli, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter curvus, campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter lari, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum subsp. bubulus, a campylobacter sp. (pig isolate), [bacteroides] gracilis, and [bacteroides] ureolyticus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
