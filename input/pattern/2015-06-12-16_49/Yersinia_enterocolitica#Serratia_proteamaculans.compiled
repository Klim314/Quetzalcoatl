TI  - Growth of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of quorum sensing signalling compounds produced by spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) and autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signalling compounds present in the cell-free culture supernatants (CFS), of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica-like GTE 112, Serratia proteamaculans 00612, Y. enterocolitica CITY650 and Y. enterocolitica CITY844, on the growth of two Salmonella Enteritidis and two S. Typhimurium strains was assessed though monitoring of changes in conductance of the medium. Detection times (T(det)), area and slope of conductance curves were recorded. Except for P. aeruginosa 108928, which was not found to produce AI-2, all other strains produced both AHLs and AI-2. Thereafter, aliquots (20% in the final volume) of these CFS were transferred into NZ Amine broth inoculated with ca. 10(3) CFU/ml of stationary phase cultures of each Salmonella strain. While the CFS of P. aeruginosa induced a shorter detection time, i.e. acceleration of the metabolic activity, the CFS of the other microorganisms increased the detection time of Salmonella strains compared to control samples (i.e. without CFS). Results indicate that the growth of Salmonella may be affected by the presence of Quorum sensing (QS) signalling compounds and/or other novel signals existing in CFS, produced by other bacterial species and confirm the complexity of bacterial communication.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
