TI  == improvement of cellulolytic properties of clostridium cellulolyticum by metabolic engineering.
AB  == cellulolytic clostridia have evolved to catabolize lignocellulosic materials at a seasonal biorhythm, so their biotechnological exploitation requires genetic improvements. as high carbon flux leads to pyruvate accumulation, which is responsible for the cessation of growth of clostridium cellulolyticum, this accumulation is decreased by heterologous expression of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from zymomonas mobilis. in comparison with that of the  wild strain, growth of the recombinant strain at the same specific rate but for 145 h instead of 80 h led to a 150% increase in cellulose consumption and a 180%  increase in cell dry weight. the fermentation pattern was shifted significantly:  lactate production decreased by 48%, whereas the concentrations of acetate and ethanol increased by 93 and 53%, respectively. this study demonstrates that the fermentation of cellulose, the most abundant and renewable polymer on earth, can  be greatly improved by using genetically engineered c. cellulolyticum.
