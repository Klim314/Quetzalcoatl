TI  == kinetic-dependent killing of oral pathogens with nitric oxide.
AB  == nitric oxide (no)-releasing silica nanoparticles were synthesized via the co-condensation of tetramethyl orthosilicate with aminosilanes and subsequent conversion of secondary amines to n-diazeniumdiolate no donors. a series of ~150  nm no-releasing particles with different no totals and release kinetics (i.e., half-lives) were achieved by altering both the identity and mol% composition of the aminosilane precursors. independent of identical 2 h no-release totals, enhanced antibacterial action was observed against the periodontopathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis with extended  no-release kinetics at ph 7.4. negligible bactericidal effect was observed against cariogenic streptococcus mutans at ph 7.4, even when using no-releasing silica particles with greater no-release totals. however, antibacterial activity  was observed against s. mutans at lower ph (6.4). this result was attributed to more rapid proton-initiated decomposition of the n-diazeniumdiolate no donors and greater no-release payloads. the data suggest a differential sensitivity to no between cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria with implications for the future development of no-releasing oral care therapeutics.

TI  == novel antimicrobial peptide specifically active against porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, the major etiologic agent of chronic periodontitis, produces a broad spectrum of virulence factors, including outer membrane vesicles, lipopolysaccharides, hemolysins and proteinases. antimicrobial peptides (amps) including bacteriocins have been found to inhibit the growth of p. gingivalis; however, these peptides are relatively large molecules. hence, it is  difficult to synthesize them by a scale-up production. therefore, this study aimed to synthesize a shorter amp that was still active against p. gingivalis. a  peptide that contained three cationic amino acids (arg, his and lys), two anionic amino acids (glu and asp), hydrophobic amino acids residues (leu, ile, val, ala and pro) and hydrophilic residues (ser and gly) was obtained and named pep-7. its bioactivity and stability were tested after various treatments. the mechanism of  action of pep-7 and its toxicity to human red blood cells were investigated. the  pep-7 inhibited two pathogenic p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and p. gingivalis atcc 53978 (wp50) strains at a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of 1.7 microm, but was ineffective against other oral microorganisms (p. intermedia, tannerella  forsythensis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguinis). from transmission electron microscopy studies, pep-7 caused pore formation at the poles of the cytoplasmic membranes of p. gingivalis. a concentration of pep-7 at  four times that of its mbc induced some hemolysis but only at 0.3 %. the pep-7 was heat stable under pressure (autoclave at 110 and 121 degrees c) and possessed activity over a ph range of 6.8-8.5. it was not toxic to periodontal cells over a range of 70.8-4.4 mum and did not induce toxic pro-inflammatory cytokines. the pep-7 showed selective activity against porphyromonas sp. by altering the permeability barriers of p. gingivalis. the pep-7 was not mutagenic in vitro. this work highlighted the potential for the use of this synthetic pep-7 against p. gingivalis.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == real-time monitoring of the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == bacterial metabolic activity is associated with the onset and progression mechanisms of oral biofilm-mediated disease; however, at present no method to monitor bacterial metabolism exists, especially for periodontopathic bacteria. therefore, we aimed to establish a novel method for monitoring the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella  intermedia (pi) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), as well as streptococcus mutans (sm) for comparison. the method is based on the dye resazurin, which is converted to the fluorescent molecule resorufin by reducing molecules derived from bacterial metabolism. additionally, the effects of antimicrobial substances on bacterial metabolic activity were evaluated using this method. when bacterial suspensions were incubated with tryptone, glutamate, aspartate or glucose in the  presence of resazurin, the fluorescence intensity increased over time by these bacterial metabolic reactions, indicating that this method can be used to monitor the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria. chlorhexidine showed the 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) of 15-49mug/ml for tryptone metabolism by pg, pi, and fn, and 7.1-18mug/ml for glucose metabolism by pi and sm. the ic50s for cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium dodecyl sulfate were 0.8-2.1 and 28-44mug/ml, respectively for all bacteria examined. fluoride had no effect except the ic50 of 640mug/ml for sm, while minocycline hydrochloride had no effect on any of the bacteria. the present study established the method for real-time monitoring of the metabolic activity of periodontopathic bacteria, and the method might be useful for evaluating the effects of antimicrobial substances on the bacterial metabolic activity.

TI  == interleukin-6 and microrna profiles induced by oral bacteria in human atheroma derived and healthy smooth muscle cells.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with possible contributions from bacterial antigens. we aimed to investigate the role of oral bacteria as inducers of inflammatory cascades in smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy patients (athsmcs) and healthy controls (hsmcs). findings: inactivated streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gorgonii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used to stimulate inflammation in hsmcs and athsmcs. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha) was used as a positive control in all stimulations. interleukin-6 (il-6) levels were  determined from cell culture supernatants and microrna expression profiles from cells after 24 h of bacterial stimulation. genome wide expression (gwe) analyses  were performed after 5 h stimulation. all studied bacteria induced pro inflammatory il-6 production in both smcs. the most powerful inducer of il-6 was  a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.001). of the 84 studied mirnas, expression of 9 mirnas differed significantly (p </= 0.001) between hsmcs and athsmcs stimulated  with inactivated bacteria or tnfalpha. the data was divided into two groups: high il-6 producers (a. actinomytectemcomititans and tnfalpha) and low il-6 producers  (streptococcal strains and p. gingivalis). the expression of 4 mirnas (mir-181-5p, -186-5p, -28-5p and -155-5p) differed statistically significantly (p < 0.001) between healthy hsmcs and athsmcs in the low il-6 producer group. according to multidimensional scaling, two gene expression clusters were seen: one in hsmcs and one athsmcs. conclusions: our results suggest that inactivated oral bacteria induce inflammation that is differently regulated in healthy and atherosclerotic smcs.

TI  == evaluation of antibacterial activity and osteoblast-like cell viability of tin, zrn and (ti1-xzrx)n coating on titanium.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to evaluate antibacterial activity and osteoblast-like cell viability according to the ratio of titanium nitride and zirconium nitride coating on commercially pure titanium using an arc ion plating  system. materials and methods: polished titanium surfaces were used as controls.  surface topography was observed by scanning electron microscopy, and surface roughness was measured using a two-dimensional contact stylus profilometer. antibacterial activity was evaluated against streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis with the colony-forming unit assay. cell compatibility,  mrna expression, and morphology related to human osteoblast-like cells (mg-63) on the coated specimens were determined by the xtt assay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. results: the number of s. mutans colonies on the tin, zrn and (ti1-xzrx)n coated surface decreased significantly compared to those on the non-coated titanium surface (p<0.05). conclusion: the number of p. gingivalis colonies on all surfaces showed no significant differences. tin, zrn and (ti1-xzrx)n coated titanium showed antibacterial activity against s. mutans related to initial biofilm formation but not p. gingivalis associated with advanced periimplantitis, and did not influence osteoblast-like cell viability.

TI  == functional signatures of oral dysbiosis during periodontitis progression revealed by microbial metatranscriptome analysis.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a polymicrobial biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that affects 743 million people worldwide. the current model to explain periodontitis progression proposes that changes in the relative abundance of members of the oral microbiome lead to dysbiosis in the host-microbiome crosstalk and then to inflammation and bone loss. using combined metagenome/metatranscriptome analysis of the subgingival microbiome in progressing and non-progressing sites, we have characterized the distinct molecular signatures of periodontitis progression. methods: metatranscriptome analysis was conducted on samples from subgingival biofilms from progressing and  stable sites from periodontitis patients. community-wide expression profiles were obtained using next generation sequencing (illumina). sequences were aligned using 'bowtie2' against a constructed oral microbiome database. differential expression analysis was performed using the non-parametric algorithm implemented  on the r package 'noiseqbio'. we summarized global functional activities of the oral microbial community by set enrichment analysis based on the gene ontology (go) orthology. results: gene ontology enrichment analysis showed an over-representation in the baseline of active sites of terms related to cell motility, lipid a and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and transport of iron, potassium, and amino acids. periodontal pathogens (tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) upregulated different tonb-dependent receptors, peptidases, proteases, aerotolerance genes, iron transport genes, hemolysins, and crispr-associated genes. surprisingly, organisms that have not been usually associated with the disease (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and pseudomonas fluorenscens) were highly active transcribing putative virulence factors. we detected patterns of activities associated with progression of clinical traits. among those we found that the profiles of expression of cobalamin biosynthesis, proteolysis, and potassium transport were associated with the evolution towards disease. conclusions: we identified metabolic changes in the microbial community associated with the initial stages of dysbiosis. regardless of the overall composition of the community, certain metabolic signatures are consistent with disease progression. our results suggest that the  whole community, and not just a handful of oral pathogens, is responsible for an  increase in virulence that leads to progression. trial registration: nct01489839, 6 december 2011.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of subgingival microbiota in distinct periodontal conditions.
AB  == subgingival microorganisms are potentially associated with periodontal diseases.  however, changes in the subgingival microbiota during the progress of periodontal diseases are poorly understood. in this study, we analyzed bacterial communities  in the subgingival paper point samples from 32 korean individuals with no sign of disease, gingivitis, or periodontitis using 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing. a total of 256,113 reads representing 26 phyla, 433 genera, and 1,016 species were  detected. bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, synergistetes, and spirochaetes were the abundant phyla in periodontitis subjects, whereas firmicutes and proteobacteria were identified as the dominant phyla in the gingivitis and healthy subjects, respectively. although high levels of porphyromonas, fusobacterium, fretibacterium, rothia, filifactor, and treponema genera were observed in the periodontitis subjects, streptococcus, capnocytophaga, leptotrichia, and haemophilus genera were found at high frequency in the gingivitis subjects. species including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and fretibacterium fastidiosum were significantly increased in periodontitis subjects. on the other hand, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and leptotrichia hongkongensis were preferentially observed in the gingivitis subjects. intriguingly, the halophile halomonas hamiltonii was revealed as a predominant species in the healthy subjects. based on fast unifrac  analysis, distinctive bacterial clusters were classified for the healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis state. the current findings might be useful for understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == functional advantages of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone pathogen of periodontitis. outer membrane  vesicles (omvs) have been considered as both offense and defense components of this bacterium. previous studies indicated that like their originating cells, p.  gingivalis vesicles, are able to invade oral epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts, in order to promote aggregation of some specific oral bacteria and to induce host immune responses. in the present study, we investigated the invasive efficiency of p. gingivalis omvs and compared results with that of the originating cells. results revealed that 70-90% of human primary oral epithelial  cells, gingival fibroblasts, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells carried vesicles from p. gingivalis 33277 after being exposed to the vesicles for 1 h, while 20-50% of the host cells had internalized p. gingivalis cells. we also detected vesicle-associated dna and rna and a vesicle-mediated horizontal gene transfer in p. gingivalis strains, which represents a novel mechanism for gene transfer between p. gingivalis strains. moreover, purified vesicles of p. gingivalis appear to have a negative impact on biofilm formation and the maintenance of streptococcus gordonii. our results suggest that vesicles are likely the best offence weapon of p. gingivalis for bacterial survival in the oral cavity and for induction of periodontitis.

TI  == bactericidal effect of extracts and metabolites of robinia pseudoacacia l. on streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis causing dental plaque and periodontal inflammatory diseases.
AB  == the mouth cavity hosts many types of anaerobic bacteria, including streptococcus  mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis, which cause periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries. the present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial potential of extracts of robinia pseudoacacia and its different fractions, as well as some of its natural compounds against oral pathogens and a  nonpathogenic reference bacteria, escherichia coli. the antibacterial activity of the crude extract and the solvent fractions (hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol) of r. pseudoacacia were evaluated against s. mutans, p. gingivalis and e. coli dh5alpha by standard micro-assay procedure using conventional sterile polystyrene microplates. the results showed that the crude extract was more active against p. gingivalis (100% growth inhibition) than against s. mutans (73% growth inhibition) at 1.8 mg/ml. the chloroform and hexane fractions were active  against p. gingivalis, with 91 and 97% growth inhibition, respectively, at 0.2 mg/ml. none of seven natural compounds found in r. pseudoacacia exerted an antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis; however, fisetin and myricetin at 8 microg/ml inhibited the growth of s. mutans by 81% and 86%, respectively. the crude extract of r. pseudoacacia possesses bioactive compounds that could completely control the growth of p. gingivalis. the antibiotic activities of the  hexane and chloroform fractions suggest that the active compounds are hydrophobic in nature. the results indicate the effectiveness of the plant in clinical applications for the treatment of dental plaque and periodontal inflammatory diseases and its potential use as disinfectant for various surgical and orthodontic appliances.

TI  == antibacterial and osteogenic stem cell differentiation properties of photoinduced tio2 nanoparticle-decorated tio2 nanotubes.
AB  == aim: to improve the antibacterial and mammalian cell compatibility properties of  titania nanotubes (tnts) anodized into titanium (ti). materials & methods: 3-8-nm tio2 nanoparticles were decorated on the surface and inside tnt (tnt-tio2) through a hydrothermal method. after uv light treatment, two types of oral bacteria and stem cells were cultured on the samples to determine antibacterial and compatibility properties. results: tio2 nanoparticles increased the surface area and photocatalysis of tnts. based on the photocatalysis effect and prolonged photo-induced wettability, the numbers of streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas  gingivalis were lower on the surface of tnt-tio2 than pure ti and tnts after the  first 7 days. specifically, for s. mutans, the glycosytransferase (gtf) genes were downregulated 0.1-0.2-fold on tnt-tio2. due to the different topography and  high surface energy of tnt-tio2, stem cells also showed improved osteogenic functions on tnt-tio2. conclusion: in this study, we demonstrated for the first time improved antibacterial properties and, at the same time, greater stem cell osteogenic capacity when decorating tnts with nanosized tio2 particles, which may significantly improve orthopedic and dental implant efficacy.

TI  == [features of adhesion of anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria and candida albicans fungi to experimental samples of basis dental plastic depending on surface roughness and polishing method].
AB  == aim: study the main surface parameters of milled polyacrylic materials using atomic force microscopy and primary microbial adhesion of periodontopathogenic group bacteria and candida albicans fungi taking into consideration the method of sample polishing. materials and methods: studied samples: mill-treated without polishing (control); ergobox polished; polished in dental laboratory conditions;  polished by a rubber brush in dentists' office. microbial strains belonging to periodontopathogenic species (clinical isolates) that had been isolated from periodontal pockets of periodontitis patients: porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis, c. albicans fungi were used for modelling experiments of primary adhesion of microbes to the material samples. results: s. sanguis had the highest degree of adhesion to polymer after milling,  p. gingivalis, c. albicans--medium, f. nucleatum--low. a significant reduction of adhesion is observed during polishing in dental laboratory conditions or ergobox, less significant--during polishing in dental office. conclusion: the data obtained allow to make a conclusion that the samples from polymer materials for preparation of prosthesis basis have varying degree of intensity of microbial adhesion of members of periodontopathogenic microflora and c. albicans fungi that depends on the polishing method, that accordingly determined the differences in colonization resistance against formation of microbial biofilm during polymer use in clinical conditions. . ,

TI  == evaluation of the co-existence of the red fluorescent plaque bacteria p. gingivalis with s. gordonii and s. mutans in white spot lesion formation during orthodontic treatment.
AB  == background: early detection of white spot lesions (wsls) around brackets during orthodontic treatment is important for treatment and prevention. but it is unclear whether red fluorescent plaque (rfp) bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and its co-existence with streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii has any significant influence on this. therefore the role of this bacterial co existence  and wsls formation during one year of fixed orthodontic therapy was evaluated. methods: fourteen 12 to 22 year old (mean 15+/-3 years) consecutive patients attending the university of liverpool dental hospital were recruited for this study. quantitative light-induced fluorescence (qlf) was used to identify rfp and enamel demineralisation, respectively, on anterior labial surfaces before and after placement of fixed orthodontic appliances. bacterial composition was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) following nested pcr amplification of the 16s rrna v2-v3 hypervariable region. results: wsls were recorded on 4.2% of tooth surfaces and wsl development was not associated with rfp bacteria p. gingivalis presence. differences in rfp bacteria p. gingivalis presence with s. mutans and s. gordonii, were observed before and after appliance placement. intra subject changes in plaque flora between visits were not significantly associated with wsl development (p>0.05). however, dgge profiles indicated that apart from s. mutans, s. gordonii might also have a role in human  enamel demineralisation. conclusions: fixed orthodontic brackets in adolescents may play a role in altering bacterial composition around brackets during orthodontic treatment and it is plausible that s. gordonii also have a role in human enamel demineralisation. combinatorial approach of qlf technology and dgge  may be useful in determining bacterial composition during orthodontic therapy which could inform clinical interventions.

TI  == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI  == bacteria-induced intracellular signalling in platelets.
AB  == multiple studies have now shown that various species of bacteria can stimulate platelets; many in a strain and donor-dependent manner. the signalling pathways underlying this platelet activation has been the subject of scrutiny for the last decade. the best-delineated pathway is that in response to streptococcal species, such as streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis), streptococcus gordonii (s. gordonii) and streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), where a pathway is initiated by the engagement of the low affinity igg receptor, fcgammariia. this leads to and involves the tyrosine kinase syk, the adaptor protein linker of activated t cells (lat) and subsequently both phospholipase cgamma2 (plcgamma2) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi-3-k). finally, this leads to the expression of  the alphaiibbeta3 integrin, the synthesis and release of thromboxane a2 (t x a2)  and the exocytosis of pf4, each of which plays a crucial role in secondary signalling and full platelet activation. roles for other signalling pathways in streptococcal-induced platelet activation are less clear, although an adp-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a glycoprotein ib/ix/v-mediated pathway and perhaps a complement-induced pathway have each been proposed. platelet activation by porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) at least partially shares the fcgammariia/syk/plcgamma2/pi-3-k mechanism utilised by streptococcal species. however, it has also been suggested that p. gingivalis activates platelets by two additional methods; stimulation of the protease-activated receptors leading to activation of phospholipase cbeta (plcbeta), and the engagement of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by released lipopolysaccharide leading to an ill-defined pathway which may involve pi-3-k. consequently, it appears that bacteria can stimulate platelets by eliciting multiple signalling pathways some of which are common, and some unique, to individual species.

TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == quantitative proteomics reveal distinct protein regulations caused by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans within subgingival biofilms.
AB  == periodontitis is an infectious disease that causes the inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues, caused by polymicrobial biofilm communities growing on the tooth surface. aggressive periodontitis is strongly associated with the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival biofilms. nevertheless, whether and how a. actinomycetemcomitans orchestrates molecular changes within the biofilm is unclear. the aim of this work was to decipher the interactions between a. actinomycetemcomitans and other  bacterial species in a multi-species biofilm using proteomic analysis. an in vitro 10-species "subgingival" biofilm model, or its derivative that included additionally a. actinomycetemcomitans, were anaerobically cultivated on hydroxyapatite discs for 64 h. when present, a. actinomycetemcomitans formed dense intra-species clumps within the biofilm mass, and did not affect the numbers of the other species in the biofilm. liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteomic content of the biofilm lysate. a  total of 3225 and 3352 proteins were identified in the biofilm, in presence or absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, respectively. label-free quantitative proteomics revealed that 483 out of the 728 quantified bacterial proteins (excluding those of a. actinomycetemcomitans) were accordingly regulated. interestingly, all quantified proteins from prevotella intermedia were up-regulated, and most quantified proteins from campylobacter rectus, streptococcus anginosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were down-regulated in presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. enrichment of gene ontology pathway analysis showed that the regulated groups of proteins were responsible primarily  for changes in the metabolic rate, the ferric iron-binding, and the 5s rna binding capacities, on the universal biofilm level. while the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans did not affect the numeric composition or absolute protein  numbers of the other biofilm species, it caused qualitative changes in their overall protein expression profile. these molecular shifts within the biofilm warrant further investigation on their potential impact on its virulence properties, and association with periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == high in vitro antibacterial activity of pac-525 against porphyromonas gingivalis  biofilms cultured on titanium.
AB  == in order to investigate the potential of short antimicrobial peptides (amps) as alternative antibacterial agents during the treatment of peri-implantitis, the cytotoxic activity of three short amps, that is, pac-525, ksl-w, and ksl, was determined using the mtt assay. the antimicrobial activity of these amps, ranging in concentration from 0.0039 mg/ml to 0.5 mg/ml, against the predominant planktonic pathogens, including streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis, involved in peri-implantitis was investigated. furthermore, 2-day-old p. gingivalis biofilms cultured on titanium surfaces were  treated with pac-525 and subsequently observed and analysed using confocal laser  scanning microscopy (clsm). the average cell proliferation curve indicated that there was no cytotoxicity due to the three short amps. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values of pac-525 were 0.0625 mg/ml and 0.125 mg/ml, respectively, for p. gingivalis and 0.0078 mg/ml and 0.0156 mg/ml, respectively, for f. nucleatum. using clsm, we confirmed that compared to 0.1% chlorhexidine, 0.5 mg/ml of pac-525 caused a significant decrease in biofilm thickness and a decline in the percentage of live bacteria. these data indicate that pac-525 has unique properties that might make it suitable for the inhibition the growth of pathogenic bacteria around dental implants.

TI  == drug resistance of bacterial dental biofilm and the potential use of natural compounds as alternative for prevention and treatment.
AB  == oral diseases, such as dental caries and periodontal disease are directly linked  with the ability of bacteria to form biofilm. the development of dental caries involves acidogenic and aciduric gram-positive bacteria colonizing the supragingival biofilm (streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomycetes). periodontal diseases have been linked to anaerobic gram-negative bacteria forming a subgingival plaque (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus, prevotella and fusobacterium). cells embedded in biofilm are up to 1000-fold more resistant to antibiotics compared to their planctonic ones. several mechanisms have been proposed to explain biofilms drug resistance. given the increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics currently used in dentistry, a great importance is given to natural compounds for the prevention of oral bacterial growth, adhesion  and colonization. over the past decade, interest in drugs derived from medicinal  plants has markedly increased. it has been well documented that medicinal plants  and natural compounds confer considerable antibacterial activity against various  microorganisms including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. this paper provides a review of the literature focusing on the studies on (i) biofilm in the oral cavity, (ii) drug resistance of bacterial biofilm and (iii) the potential use of plant extracts, essential oils and natural compounds as biofilm preventive agents in dentistry, involving their origin and their mechanism of biofilm inhibition.

TI  == killing dental pathogens using antibacterial graphene oxide.
AB  == dental caries and periodontal diseases have a close relationship with microbes such as streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. graphene oxide (go), as the derivative of graphene, plays an important role in many areas including biology and medicine. in particular, it has been known as a promising antimicrobial nanomaterial. in this study, we focused on the antimicrobial property of go against dental pathogens. with the utilization of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) reduced test, colony forming units (cfu) counting, growth curve observation, live/dead fluorescent staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), we found go  nanosheets were highly effective in inhibiting the growth of dental pathogens. transmission electron microscopy (tem) images revealed that the cell wall and membrane of bacteria lost their integrity and the intracellular contents leaked out after they were treated by go. therefore, go nanosheets would be an effective antibacterial material against dental pathogens and the potential applications in dental care and therapy are promising.

TI  == anaerobic culture to detect periodontal and caries pathogens.
AB  == background: anaerobic culture has been critical in our understanding of the oral  microbiotas. highlight: studies in advanced periodontitis in the 1970's revealed  microbial complexes that associated with different clinical presentations. taxonomy studies identified species newly-observed in periodontitis as aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter (wolinella) rectus and other campylobacter species, and tannerella (bacteroides) forsythia. anaerobic culture of initial periodontitis showed overlap in the microbiota with  gingivitis, and added selenomonas noxia and filifactor alocis as putative periodontal pathogens. porphyromonas gingivalis and t. forsythia were found to be associated with initial periodontitis in adults. the dominant microbiota of dental caries differs from that of periodontitis. the major cariogenic species are acidogenic and acid tolerant species particularly streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species. anaerobic culture of severe early childhood caries revealed a widely diverse microbiota, comparable to that observed using cloning and sequencing. the pcr-based cloning approach, however, underestimated actinobacteria compared with culture. only a subset of the caries-associated microbiota was acid tolerant, with different segments of the microbiota cultured on blood agar compared to a low ph acid agar. while the major caries-associated species was s. mutans, a new species, scardovia wiggsiae, was significantly associated with early childhood caries. higher counts of s. wiggsiae were also observed in initial white spot carious lesions in adolescents. conclusion: in periodontitis and dental caries, anaerobic culture studies of advanced disease provided a comprehensive analysis of the microbiota of these infections. anaerobic culture highlighted the limitation of pcr with standard primers that underestimate detection of actinobacteria.

TI  == scratching the surface - tobacco-induced bacterial biofilms.
AB  == individual environmental factors, such as iron, temperature and oxygen, are known to have a profound effect on bacterial phenotype. therefore, it is surprising so  little known is about the influence of chemically complex cigarette smoke on bacterial physiology. recent evidence has demonstrated that tobacco smoke and components alter the bacterial surface and promote biofilm formation in several important human pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, klebsiella pneumonia, porphyromonas gingivalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the relevance to increased susceptibility to infectious disease in smokers and to treatment are reviewed.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == establishment of an oral infection model resembling the periodontal pocket in a perfusion bioreactor system.
AB  == periodontal infection involves a complex interplay between oral biofilms, gingival tissues and cells of the immune system in a dynamic microenvironment. a  humanized in vitro model that reduces the need for experimental animal models, while recapitulating key biological events in a periodontal pocket, would constitute a technical advancement in the study of periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to use a dynamic perfusion bioreactor in order to develop a gingival epithelial-fibroblast-monocyte organotypic co-culture on collagen sponges. an 11 species subgingival biofilm was used to challenge the generated tissue in the bioreactor for a period of 24 h. the histological and scanning electron microscopy analysis displayed an epithelial-like layer on the surface of the collagen sponge, supported by the underlying ingrowth of gingival fibroblasts, while monocytic cells were also found within the sponge mass. bacterial quantification of the biofilm showed that in the presence of the organotypic tissue, the growth of selected biofilm species, especially campylobacter rectus, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, and porphyromonas gingivalis, was suppressed, indicating a potential antimicrobial effect by the tissue. multiplex immunoassay analysis of cytokine secretion showed that interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-2, il-4, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha levels in cell culture supernatants were significantly up-regulated in presence of the biofilm, indicating a positive inflammatory response of the organotypic tissue to the biofilm challenge. in conclusion, this  novel host-biofilm interaction organotypic model might resemble the periodontal pocket and have an important impact on the study of periodontal infections, by minimizing the need for the use of experimental animal models.

TI  == selected dietary (poly)phenols inhibit periodontal pathogen growth and biofilm formation.
AB  == periodontitis (pd) is a chronic infectious disease mediated by bacteria in the oral cavity. (poly)phenols (pps), ubiquitous in plant foods, possess antimicrobial activities and may be useful in the prevention and management of periodontitis. the objective of this study was to test the antibacterial effects  of selected pps on periodontal pathogens, on both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. selected pps (n = 48) were screened against streptococcus mitis (s. mitis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). the antibacterial potential of each compound was evaluated in terms  of planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (pmic) and planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration (pmbc) using standardized broth microdilution assays.  the most active pps were further tested for their effect on mono-species and multi-species biofilms using a colorimetric resazurin-based viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. of the 48 pps tested, 43 showed effective inhibition of planktonic growth of one or more test strains, of which curcumin was the most potent (pmic range = 7.8-62.5 mug ml(-1)), followed by pyrogallol (pmic range = 2.4-2500 mug ml(-1)), pyrocatechol (mic range = 4.9-312.5 mug ml(-1)) and quercetin (pmic range = 31.2-500 mug ml(-1)). at this concentration,  adhesion of curcumin and quercetin to the substrate also inhibited adhesion of s. mitis, and biofilm formation and maturation. while both curcumin and quercetin were able to alter architecture of mature multi-species biofilms, only curcumin-treated biofilms displayed a significantly reduced metabolic activity. overall, pps possess antibacterial activities against periodontopathic bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. further cellular and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm their beneficial activities and potential use in the prevention and or treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic alpha-helical  octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase of rice.
AB  == amyi-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase (amyi-1) of rice (oryza  sativa l. japonica), is a novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (amp) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using  a chemiluminescence method that measures atp derived from viable cells. of the ten kinds of human pathogens, amyi-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against  nine. its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ics50 ) against porphyromonas gingivalis, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, and streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 mum, respectively. amyi-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 mum, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 mum. the degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from p. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of amyi-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of p. aeruginosa, s. mutans, and  c. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (pi), a dna-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when amyi-1-18 was added at a concentration  equal to its 4xic50 . therefore, the antimicrobial activity of amyi-1-18 against  p. aeruginosa and s. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. in contrast, its antimicrobial activity against p.  gingivalis and c. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. collectively, these results indicate that amyi-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent amp against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == combinatorial effects of arginine and fluoride on oral bacteria.
AB  == dental caries is closely associated with the microbial disequilibrium between acidogenic/aciduric pathogens and alkali-generating commensal residents within the dental plaque. fluoride is a widely used anticaries agent, which promotes tooth hard-tissue remineralization and suppresses bacterial activities. recent clinical trials have shown that oral hygiene products containing both fluoride and arginine possess a greater anticaries effect compared with those containing fluoride alone, indicating synergy between fluoride and arginine in caries management. here, we hypothesize that arginine may augment the ecological benefit of fluoride by enriching alkali-generating bacteria in the plaque biofilm and thus synergizes with fluoride in controlling dental caries. specifically, we assessed the combinatory effects of naf/arginine on planktonic and biofilm cultures of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and porphyromonas gingivalis with checkerboard microdilution assays. the optimal naf/arginine combinations were selected, and their combinatory effects on microbial composition were further examined in single-, dual-, and 3-species biofilm using  bacterial species-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. we found that arginine synergized with fluoride in suppressing acidogenic s. mutans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. in addition, the naf/arginine combination synergistically reduced s. mutans but enriched s. sanguinis within the multispecies biofilms. more importantly, the optimal combination of naf/arginine maintained a "streptococcal pressure" against the potential growth of oral anaerobe p. gingivalis within the alkalized biofilm. taken together, we conclude that the combinatory application of fluoride and arginine has a potential synergistic effect in maintaining a healthy oral microbial equilibrium and thus represents a promising ecological approach to caries management.

TI  == the oral microbiome and the immunobiology of periodontal disease and caries.
AB  == the composition of the oral microbiome differs from one intraoral site to another, reflecting in part the host response and immune capacity at each site. by focusing on two major oral infections, periodontal disease and caries, new principles of disease emerge. periodontal disease affects the soft tissues and bone that support the teeth. caries is a unique infection of the dental hard tissues. the initiation of both diseases is marked by an increase in the complexity of the microbiome. in periodontitis, pathobionts and keystone pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis appear in greater proportion than in health. as a keystone pathogen, p. gingivalis impairs host immune responses and appears necessary but not sufficient to cause periodontitis. historically, dental caries had been causally linked to streptococcus mutans. contemporary microbiome  studies now indicate that singular pathogens are not obvious in either caries or  periodontitis. both diseases appear to result from a perturbation among relatively minor constituents in local microbial communities resulting in dysbiosis. emergent consortia of the minor members of the respective microbiomes  act synergistically to stress the ability of the host to respond and protect. in  periodontal disease, host protection first occurs at the level of innate gingival epithelial immunity. secretory iga antibody and other salivary antimicrobial systems also act against periodontopathic and cariogenic consortia. when the gingival immune response is impaired, periodontal tissue pathology results when matrix metalloproteinases are released from neutrophils and t cells mediate alveolar bone loss. in caries, several species are acidogenic and aciduric and appear to work synergistically to promote demineralization of the enamel and dentin. whereas technically possible, particularly for caries, vaccines are unlikely to be commercialized in the near future because of the low morbidity of  caries and periodontitis.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of pgla-am1, cpf-am1, and magainin-am1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium  nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides  showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI  == a yada-like autotransporter, hag1 in veillonella atypica is a multivalent hemagglutinin involved in adherence to oral streptococci, porphyromonas gingivalis, and human oral buccal cells.
AB  == dental biofilm development is a sequential process, and adherence between microbes and the salivary pellicle (adhesion) as well as among different microbes (co-adhesion or coaggregation) plays a critical role in building a biofilm community. the veillonella species are among the most predominant species in the  oral cavity and coaggregate with many initial, early, middle, and late colonizers. similar to oral fusobacteria, they are also considered bridging species in biofilm development. however, the mechanism of this ability has yet to be reported, due to the previous lack of a genetic transformation system in the entire genus. in this study, we used our recently discovered transformable veillonella strain, veillonella atypica ok5, to probe the mechanism of coaggregation between veillonella species and other oral bacteria. by insertional inactivation of all eight putative hemagglutinin genes, we identified one gene, hag1, which is involved in v. atypica coaggregation with the initial colonizers streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus cristatus, and the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. the hag1 mutant also abolished adherence to human buccal cells. inhibition assays using various chemical or physiological treatments suggest different mechanisms being involved in coaggregation with different partners. the entire hag1 gene was sequenced and shown to be the largest known bacterial hemagglutinin gene.

TI  == regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: in periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (am) and nitric oxide (no). the aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. material and methods: regulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, veillonella atypica, streptococcus salivarius and candida  albicans was examined. am and no were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (no metabolites) griess assay respectively. cellular production of am and inducible no synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. the inter-relationship of am and no production were further investigated with macrophages. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus induced maximal levels of both am and no after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral  keratinocytes. am production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the no donor s-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible no synthase inhibitor, nomega -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. likewise, no production was increased upon exposure to am, while the am receptor antagonist am 22-52 reduced the release of no. conclusions: pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, p. gingivalis and prev. intermedia, and commensals, s. salivarius and v. atypica, as regards the upregulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes. interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. understanding the coordinated regulation of am and no production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == antimicrobial gl13k peptide coatings killed and ruptured the wall of streptococcus gordonii and prevented formation and growth of biofilms.
AB  == infection is one of the most prevalent causes for dental implant failure. we have developed a novel antimicrobial peptide coating on titanium by immobilizing the antimicrobial peptide gl13k. gl13k was developed from the human salivary protein  bpifa2. the peptide exhibited mic of 8 microg/ml against planktonic pseudonomas aeruginosa and their biofilms were reduced by three orders of magnitude with 100  microg/ml gl13k. this peptide concentration also killed 100% of streptococcus gordonii. at 1 mg/ml, gl13k caused less than 10% lysis of human red blood cells,  suggesting low toxicity to mammalian cells. our gl13k coating has also previously showed bactericidal effect and inhibition of biofilm growth against peri-implantitis related pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis. the gl13k coating was cytocompatible with human fibroblasts and osteoblasts. however, the bioactivity of antimicrobial coatings has been commonly tested under (quasi)static culture conditions that are far from simulating conditions for biofilm formation and growth in the oral cavity. oral salivary flow over a coating is persistent, applies continuous shear forces, and supplies sustained nutrition to bacteria. this accelerates bacteria metabolism and biofilm growth. in this work, the antimicrobial effect of the coating was tested against streptococcus gordonii, a primary colonizer that provides attachment for the biofilm accretion by p. gingivalis, using a drip-flow biofilm bioreactor with media flow rates simulating salivary flow. the gl13k peptide coatings killed bacteria and prevented formation and growth of s. gordonii biofilms in the drip-flow bioreactor and under regular mild-agitation conditions. surprisingly the interaction of the bacteria with the gl13k peptide coatings ruptured the cell wall at their septum or polar areas leaving empty shell-like structures or exposed protoplasts. the cell wall rupture was not detected under regular culture conditions, suggesting that cell wall rupture induced by gl13k peptides also requires media flow and possible attendant biological sequelae of the conditions  in the bioreactor.

TI  == proteomic and transcriptional analysis of interaction between oral microbiota porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a major periodontal pathogen, forms biofilm with other  oral bacteria such as streptococci. here, by using shotgun proteomics, we examined the molecular basis of mixed-biofilm formation by p. gingivalis with streptococcus oralis. we identified a total of 593 bacterial proteins in the biofilm. compared to the expression profile in the p. gingivalis monobiofilm, the expression of three proteins was induced and that of 31 proteins was suppressed in the mixed biofilm. additionally, the expression of two s. oralis proteins was  increased, while that of two proteins was decreased in the mixed biofilm, as compared to its monotypic profile. mrna expression analysis of selected genes using a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the proteomics data, which included overexpression of p. gingivalis fima and s. oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in association with the biofilm.  the results also indicated that s. oralis regulates the transcriptional activity  of p. gingivalis luxs to influence autoinducer-2-dependent signaling. these findings suggest that several functional molecules are involved in biofilm formation between p. gingivalis and s. oralis.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate various biological effects of silver-zeolite and a polyphenol-rich extract of a. nodosum (ascop) to prevent and/or treat biofilm-related oral diseases. porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii contribute to the biofilm formation associated with chronic periodontitis. in this study, we evaluated in vitro antibacterial and anti-biofilm effects of silver-zeolite (ag-zeolite) combined to ascop on p. gingivalis and s. gordonii growth and biofilm formation capacity. we also studied the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities of ascop in cell culture models. while ag-zeolite combined with ascop was ineffective against the growth of s. gordonii, it showed a strong bactericidal effect on p. gingivalis growth. ag-zeolite combined with ascop was able to completely inhibit s. gordonii monospecies biofilm formation as well as to reduce the formation of a bi-species  s. gordonii/p. gingivalis biofilm. ascop alone was ineffective towards the growth and/or biofilm formation of s. gordonii and p. gingivalis while it significantly  reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (tnfalpha and il-6) by lps-stimulated human like-macrophages. it also exhibited antioxidant properties and decreased lps induced lipid peroxidation in gingival epithelial cells. these  findings support promising use of these products in future preventive or therapeutic strategies against periodontal diseases.

AB  == aptamers are composed of single-stranded oilgonucleotides that can selectively bind desired molecules. it has been reported that rna or dna could act as not only a genetic messenger but also a catalyst in metabolic pathways. rna aptamers  (average sizes 40-50 bp) are smaller than antibodies and have strong binding capacities to target molecules, similar to antigen-antibody interactions. once an aptamer was selected, it can be readily produced in large quantities at low cost. the objectives of this study are to screen and develop aptamers specific to oral  pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and streptococcus mutans. the bacterial cell pellet was fixed with formaldehyde as a  target molecule for the screening of aptamers. the selex method was used for the  screening of aptamers and a modified western blot analysis was used to verify their specificities. through selex, 40 kinds of aptamers were selected and the specificity of the aptamers to the bacterial cells was confirmed by modified western blot analysis. through the selex method, 40 aptamers that specifically bind to oral pathogens were screened and isolated. the aptamers showed possibility as effective candidates for the detection agents of oral infections.

TI  == antibacterial effect of crude extract and metabolites of phytolacca americana on  pathogens responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental caries.
AB  == background: the oral cavity is the store house of different species of microorganisms that are continuously engaged in causing diseases in the mouth. the present study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial potential of crude  extracts of the aerial parts of phytolacca americana and its natural compounds against two oral pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans, which are primarily responsible for periodontal inflammatory diseases and dental  caries, as well as a nonpathogenic escherichia coli. methods: crude extract and fractions from the aerial parts of p. americana (0.008-1.8 mg/ml) were evaluated  for their potential antibacterial activity against two oral disease causing microorganisms by micro-assays. the standard natural compounds present in p. americana, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, isoqueritrin and ferulic acid, were also tested for their antibacterial activity against the pathogens at  1-8 mug/ml. results: the crude extract was highly active against p. gingivalis (100% growth inhibition) and moderately active against s. mutans (44% growth inhibition) at 1.8 mg/ml. the chloroform and hexane fraction controlled the growth of p. gingivalis with 91% and 92% growth inhibition at a concentration of  0.2 mg/ml, respectively. kaempferol exerted antibacterial activity against both the pathogens, whereas quercetin showed potent growth inhibition activity against only s. mutans in a concentration dependent manner. conclusion: the crude extract, chloroform fraction, and hexane fraction of p. americana possesses active natural compounds that can inhibit the growth of oral disease causing bacteria. thus, these extracts have the potential for use in the preparation of toothpaste and other drugs related to various oral diseases.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == effects of nicotine on streptococcus gordonii growth, biofilm formation, and cell aggregation.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is a commensal species of human oral flora. it initiates dental biofilm formation and provides binding sites for later colonizers to attach to and generate mature biofilm. smoking is the second highest risk factor  for periodontal disease, and cigarette smoke extract has been reported to facilitate porphyromonas gingivalis-s. gordonii dual-species biofilm formation. our hypothesis is that nicotine, one of the most important and active components  of tobacco, stimulates s. gordonii multiplication and aggregation. in the present study, s. gordonii planktonic cell growth (kinetic absorbance and cfu), biofilm formation (crystal violet stain and confocal laser scanning microscopy [clsm]), aggregation with/without sucrose, and 11 genes that encode binding proteins or regulators of gene expression were investigated. results demonstrated planktonic  cell growth was stimulated by 1 to 4 mg/ml nicotine treatment. biofilm formation  was increased at 0.5 to 4 mg/ml nicotine. clsm indicated bacterial cell mass was  increased by 2 and 4 mg/ml nicotine, but biofilm extracellular polysaccharide was not significantly affected by nicotine. cell aggregation was upregulated by 4, 8, and 16 mg/ml nicotine with sucrose and by 16 mg/ml nicotine without sucrose. quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr indicated s. gordonii abpa, scaa, ccpa, and srta were upregulated in planktonic cells by 2 mg/ml nicotine. in conclusion, nicotine stimulates s. gordonii planktonic cell growth, biofilm formation, aggregation, and gene expression of binding proteins. those effects may promote later pathogen attachment to tooth surfaces, the accumulation of tooth calculus,  and the development of periodontal disease in cigarette smokers.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

AB  == background: chlorhexidine (chx) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure chx (nano-chx), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. methodology/principal findings: the release of chx from the nano-chx was characterized by uv/visible absorption spectroscopy. the antimicrobial properties of nano-chx were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. the nano-chx demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/ml against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococccus faecalis. moreover, nano-chx effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as s. mutans, f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. conclusions/significance: this pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the nano-chx on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.

TI  == proteomics of fusobacterium nucleatum within a model developing oral microbial community.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a common oral organism that can provide adhesive and metabolic support to developing periodontal bacterial communities. it is within the context of these communities that disease occurs. we have previously reported whole cell proteomics analyses of porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii in early-stage communities with each other and with f. nucleatum, modeled using 18 h pellets. here, we report the adaptation of f. nucleatum to the same experimental conditions as measured by differential protein expression. about 1210 f. nucleatum proteins were detected in single species f. nucleatum control samples, 1192 in communities with p. gingivalis, 1224 with s. gordonii, and 1135 with all three species. quantitative comparisons among the proteomes revealed important changes in all mixed samples with distinct responses to p. gingivalis or s. gordonii alone and in combination. the results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david (database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery). extensive changes were detected in energy metabolism. all multispecies comparisons showed reductions in amino acid fermentation and a shift toward butanoate as a metabolic byproduct, although the  two organism model community with s. gordonii showed increases in alanine, threonine, methionine, and cysteine pathways, and in the three species samples there were increases in lysine and methionine. the communities with p. gingivalis or all three organisms showed reduced glycolysis proteins, but f. nucleatum paired with s. gordonii displayed increased glycolysis/gluconeogenesis proteins.  the s. gordonii containing two organism model also showed increases in the ethanolamine pathway while the three species sample showed decreases relative to  the f. nucleatum single organism control. all of the nascent model communities displayed reduced translation, lipopolysaccharide, and cell wall biosynthesis, dna replication and dna repair.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of antrodia camphorata extracts against oral bacteria.
AB  == antrodia camphorata (a. camphorata) is a unique, endemic and extremely rare mushroom species native to taiwan, and both crude extracts of and purified chemical compounds from a. camphorata have been reported to have a variety of significant beneficial effects, such as anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activity. however, reports on the effects of a. camphorata against dental pathogens have been limited. oral health is now recognized as important for overall general health, including conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis. streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) are the most common bacteria associated  with dental plaque and periodontopathic diseases, respectively. thus, our study examined the ability of five various crude extracts of a. camphorata to inhibit the growth of dental bacteria and anti-adherence in vitro. among the extracts, the ethanol, ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts exhibited the lowest mics against p. gingivalis and s. mutans (mic = 4 approximately 16 microg/ml). the mic of the aqueous extract was greater than 2048 microg/ml against both p. gingivalis and s. mutans. in vitro adherence of s. mutans was significantly inhibited by the addition of either the ethyl acetate extract or chloroform extract (mic = 16 approximately 24 microg/ml), while the ethanol extract (mic = 32 approximately 64 microg/ml) exhibited moderate inhibitory activity. based on the result of this study, the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts of a. camphorata may be good candidates for oral hygiene agents to control dental caries and periodontopathic  conditions.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (no)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and  silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. the effectiveness of macromolecular no release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis viability. in contrast, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to no treatment. both dendrimer- and silica-based no release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine.  these results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular no-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.

TI  == an in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. the aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. the  selected species used represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. the number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative pcr (qpcr). as outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. results: the bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. significance: while the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of  inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.

TI  == axenic culture of a candidate division tm7 bacterium from the human oral cavity and biofilm interactions with other oral bacteria.
AB  == the diversity of bacterial species in the human oral cavity is well recognized, but a high proportion of them are presently uncultivable. candidate division tm7  bacteria are almost always detected in metagenomic studies but have not yet been  cultivated. in this paper, we identified candidate division tm7 bacterial phylotypes in mature plaque samples from around orthodontic bonds in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment. successive rounds of enrichment in laboratory media led to the isolation of a pure culture of one of these candidate division tm7 phylotypes. the bacteria formed filaments of 20 to 200 mum in length within agar plate colonies and in monospecies biofilms on salivary pellicle and exhibited some unusual morphological characteristics by transmission electron microscopy, including a trilaminated cell surface layer and dense cytoplasmic deposits. proteomic analyses of cell wall protein extracts identified abundant polypeptides predicted from the tm7 partial genomic sequence. pleiomorphic phenotypes were observed when the candidate division tm7 bacterium was grown in dual-species biofilms with representatives of six different oral bacterial genera. the tm7 bacterium formed long filaments in dual-species biofilm communities with actinomyces oris or fusobacterium nucleatum. however, the tm7 isolate grew as short rods or cocci in dual-species biofilms with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, or streptococcus gordonii, forming notably robust biofilms with the latter two species. the ability to cultivate tm7 axenically should majorly advance understanding of the physiology,  genetics, and virulence properties of this novel candidate division oral bacterium.

TI  == effects of streptococcus thermophilus on volatile sulfur compounds produced by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == halitosis as oral malodour is an unpleasant odour caused by volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). vscs are produced primarily by anaerobic bacteria that abundantly produce proteinase as trypsin-like enzyme. general therapies, such as  mouthwash and plaque control, do not provide a continuous effect on oral halitosis. streptococcus thermophilus is a probiotic bacterium that is beneficial for human health. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of s. thermophilus on porphyromonas gingivalis-producing vscs and to analyze the inhibitory mechanism of halitosis. p. gingivalis was cultured with or without s.  thermophilus, and the emission of vscs from the spent culture medium was measured by gas chromatography. in order to analyze the inhibitory effect, the antibacterial activity of s. thermophilus against p. gingivalis was assessed. after the spent culture medium or whole bacterial of s. thermophilus was mixed with the spent culture medium of p. gingivalis, vscs were again measured by gas chromatograph. when s. thermophilus and p. gingivalis were co-cultivated, vscs were present at a lower level than those of single-cultured p. gingivalis. s. thermophilus inhibited growth of p. gingivalis, and the whole bacteria and the spent culture medium of s. thermophilus reduced emission of vscs gas. s. thermophilus may reduce oral malodour by inhibition of p. gingivalis growth and neutralizing vscs with their metabolites or themselves.

TI  == bioinformatic investigation of the cost management strategies of five oral microbes.
AB  == some amino acids are more energetically costly to synthesize de novo, therefore many microbes have evolved to regulate the metabolic expenditure of the cell and  reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. several oral bacterial species take up amino acids and peptides obtained from proteolysis of host proteins and hence do not rely only on de novo synthesis. the aim of this study was to investigate if five oral bacterial species implement cost management strategies to reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. since the relative de novo amino acid synthesis costs are proportional to the masses of the amino acids, the energy costs of producing proteins were assessed by calculating the mean amino acid mass for each protein. for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and  streptococcus sanguinis, the outer membrane/extracellular proteins are made up of a much larger percentage of lower average mass amino acids whereas cytoplasmic proteins are made up of a larger proportion of higher average mass amino acid residues. these results are consistent with the five oral bacterial species employing energy-saving mechanisms in the production of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. interestingly, the p. gingivalis and s. sanguinis genomes  exhibited significantly lower predicted mean amino acid masses compared with those of the genomes of the other three species, suggesting that this may provide them with an energy advantage with respect to protein biosynthetic cost.

TI  == development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  == background: inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. we therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model  to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (rsv) and gold standard  chlorhexidine (chx) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: an in vitro multi-species biofilm containing s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a  disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in okf6-tert2. cytotoxicity studies were performed using rsv and chx. multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were  treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. results: chx was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. rsv did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. in co-culture, chx-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine il-8 at both mrna and protein level. rsv-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of il-8 protein, but not mrna. conclusions: chx possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. rsv does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to  supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. this study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use  of a biofilm co-culture model.

TI  == synthesis of tio2 nanotubes with zno nanoparticles to achieve antibacterial properties and stem cell compatibility.
AB  == to endow titanium (ti) with antibacterial properties, different concentrations of zinc oxide (zno) nanoparticles were decorated on anodized titanium dioxide (tio2) nanotubes by a simple hydrothermal treatment method. the particle sizes of zno, which were evenly distributed and tightly adherent to the walls of the ti nanotubes, ranged from 20-50 nm. results from this study showed that zn was released from the tio2 nanotubes in a constant, slow, and biologically inspired manner. importantly, the results showed that the zno decorated tio2 nanotubular samples inhibited streptococcus mutants and porphyromonas gingivalis growth compared to control unmodified ti samples. specifically, s. mutants and p. gingivalis growth were both reduced 45-85% on the zno decorated ti samples compared to ti controls after 7 days of culture. when examining the mechanism of  action, it has been further found for the first time that the zno decorated ti samples inhibited the expression of streptococcus mutans bacterial adhesion genes. lastly, the results showed that the same samples which decreased bacterial growth the most (0.015 m precursor zn(no3)2 samples) did not inhibit mesenchymal  stem cell growth compared to ti controls for up to 7 days. in summary, results from this study showed that compared to plain tio2 nanotubes, tio2 decorated with 0.015 m zno provided unprecedented antibacterial properties while maintaining the stem cell proliferation capacity necessary for enhancing the use of ti in numerous medical applications, particularly in dentistry.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == antagonistic effect of protein extracts from on pathogenic bacteria and fungi of  the oral cavity.
AB  == an antibacterial substance from streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis) is known to have an inhibitory effect on putative periodontal pathogens, but its inhibitory effect on pathogens of oral candidiasis is unknown. in this study, intracellular and exocrine proteins were extracted from s. sanguinis. the antagonistic effect of the protein extracts on prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) was detected by a well-plate technique, and the effects of the protein extracts on biofilms formed  by these bacteria were evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. the antagonistic effect of the protein extracts on pathogenic fungi was investigated  using candida albicans (c. albicans) and candida tropicalis (c. tropicalis). the  growth curves of c. albicans and c. tropicalis were determined from ultraviolet absorption measurements, their morphological changes following treatment were observed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the effects  of the protein extracts on the thickness of their biofilms and the distribution of dead/live bacteria within the biofilms were detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. the results showed significant inhibitory effects of the intracellular proteins extracted from s. sanguinis on pathogenic bacteria (p. intermedia and p. gingivalis), fungi (c. albicans and c. tropicalis) and the biofilms formed by them. furthermore, the growth curves and morphology of c. albicans and c. tropicalis were altered following treatment with the intracellular proteins, resulting in disc-like depressions in the surfaces of the fungal spores and mycelia. by contrast, the exocrine proteins demonstrated no significant inhibitory effect on the pathogenic bacteria, fungi and the biofilms  formed by them. thus, it may be concluded that intracellular proteins of s. sanguinis have antibacterial activity and exert an antagonistic effect on certain pathogenic bacteria and fungi of the oral cavity.

TI  == inhibitory activity of myrtus communis oil on some clinically isolated oral pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to determine the antimicrobial activities of myrtus communis oil (mco) on some oral pathogens. material and methods: thirty strains of streptococcus mutans, aggregatibacteractinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and 20 strains of streptococcus pyogenes and candida albicans isolated from patients with dental caries, periodontal diseases, pharyngitis and oral lesions associated with artificial dentures were used for the antimicrobial activity of mco. the oil was prepared by hydrodistillation procedures using a clevenger apparatus. agar disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods were performed on various concentrations of mco (3.9-1,000 microg/ml) using all the pathogens isolated. results: all isolates were sensitive to mco at 125-1,000 microg/ml by agar disk diffusion producing inhibition zones of 8.1-41.25 mm in diameter. all of the s. pyogenes, s. mutans and c. albicans strains were sensitive to 62.5 microg/ml while 70% (21/30) of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 66.6% (20/30) of p. gingivalis were resistant to these concentrations. all s. pyogenes and s. mutans strains were sensitive to 31.25 microg/ml. all s. pyogenes strains were sensitive to 15.6 and 7.8 microg/ml of mco. none of the clinical isolates in this study were sensitive to 3.9 microg/ml or to a lower concentration of oil. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of mco for s. pyogenes, s. mutans, c. albicans, a.actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were  29.68 +/- 4.8, 31.25 +/- 0, 46.9 +/- 16, 62.5 +/- 0 and 62.5 +/- 0 microg/ml, respectively. conclusions: data obtained in this study revealed a strong antimicrobial activity of mco on the tested oral pathogens, and mco could therefore be useful in the prevention of the related oral infections.

TI  == disruption of heterotypic community development by porphyromonas gingivalis with  small molecule inhibitors.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the main etiological organisms in periodontal  disease. on oral surfaces p. gingivalis is a component of multispecies biofilm communities and can modify the pathogenic potential of the community as a whole.  accumulation of p. gingivalis in communities is facilitated by interspecies binding and communication with the antecedent colonizer streptococcus gordonii. in this study we screened a library of small molecules to identify structures that could serve as lead compounds for the development of inhibitors of p. gingivalis community development. three small molecules were identified that effectively inhibited accumulation of p. gingivalis on a substratum of s. gordonii. the structures of the small molecules are derived from the marine alkaloids oroidin and bromoageliferin and contain a 2-aminoimidazole or 2-aminobenzimidazole moiety. the most active compounds reduced expression of mfa1 and fima in p. gingivalis, genes encoding the minor and major fimbrial subunits,  respectively. these fimbrial adhesins are necessary for p. gingivalis co-adhesion with s. gordonii. these results demonstrate the potential for a small molecular inhibitor-based approach to the prevention of diseases associated with p. gingivalis.

TI  == the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis induces expression of transposases and cell death of streptococcus mitis in a biofilm model.
AB  == oral microbial communities are extremely complex biofilms with high numbers of bacterial species interacting with each other (and the host) to maintain homeostasis of the system. disturbance in the oral microbiome homeostasis can lead to either caries or periodontitis, two of the most common human diseases. periodontitis is a polymicrobial disease caused by the coordinated action of a complex microbial community, which results in inflammation of tissues that support the teeth. it is the most common cause of tooth loss among adults in the  united states, and recent studies have suggested that it may increase the risk for systemic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. in a recent series of papers, hajishengallis and coworkers proposed the idea of the "keystone-pathogen" where low-abundance microbial pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis) can orchestrate inflammatory disease by turning a benign microbial community into a dysbiotic one. the exact mechanisms by which these pathogens reorganize the healthy oral microbiome are still unknown. in the present manuscript, we present  results demonstrating that p. gingivalis induces s. mitis death and dna fragmentation in an in vitro biofilm system. moreover, we report here the induction of expression of multiple transposases in a streptococcus mitis biofilm when the periodontopathogen p. gingivalis is present. based on these results, we  hypothesize that p. gingivalis induces s. mitis cell death by an unknown mechanism, shaping the oral microbiome to its advantage.

TI  == susceptibility of porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans to antibacterial effect from mammea americana.
AB  == the development of periodontal disease and dental caries is influenced by several factors, such as microorganisms of bacterial biofilm or commensal bacteria in the mouth. these microorganisms trigger inflammatory and immune responses in the host. currently, medicinal plants are treatment options for these oral diseases.  mammea americana extracts have reported antimicrobial effects against several microorganisms. nevertheless, this effect is unknown against oral bacteria. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of m. americana extract against porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans. for  this, an experimental study was conducted. ethanolic extract was obtained from seeds of m. americana (one oil phase and one ethanolic phase). the strains of porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were exposed to this extract to evaluate its antibacterial effect. antibacterial activity was observed with the two phases of m. americana extract on p. gingivalis and s. mutans with lower mics (minimum inhibitory concentration). also, bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity was detected against s. mutans, depending on the concentration of the extract, while on m. americana extract presented only bacteriostatic activity against p. gingivalis. these findings provide important and promising information allowing for further exploration in the future.

TI  == molecular analysis of oral bacteria in dental biofilm and atherosclerotic plaques of patients with vascular disease.
AB  == background: oral bacteria have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques at a variable frequency; however, the connection between oral health and vascular and  oral bacterial profiles of patients with vascular disease is not clearly established. the aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of oral bacterial dna in the mouth and atherosclerotic plaques, in addition to assessing the patients' caries and periodontal disease history. methods: thirty samples of supragingival and subgingival plaque, saliva and atherosclerotic plaques of 13 patients with carotid stenosis or aortic aneurysm were evaluated, through real-time polymerase chain reaction, for the presence of streptococcus mutans (sm), prevotella intermedia (pi), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and treponema denticola (td). all patients were submitted to oral examination using the dmft (decayed, missing and filled teeth) and psr (periodontal screening and recording) indexes. histopathological analysis of the atherosclerotic plaques was performed. results: most of the patients were edentulous (76.9%). sm, pi, pg and td were detected in 100.0%, 92.0%, 15.3% and 30.7% of the oral samples, respectively. sm  was the most prevalent targeted bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques, detected in  100% of the samples, followed by pi (7.1%). the vascular samples were negative for pg and td. there was a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between  the presence of pg and td in the oral cavity and vascular samples. conclusion: sm was found at a high frequency in oral and vascular samples, even in edentulous patients, and its presence in atherosclerotic plaques suggests the possible involvement of this bacterium in the disease progression.

TI  == characterization of a bacterial tyrosine kinase in porphyromonas gingivalis involved in polymicrobial synergy.
AB  == interspecies communication between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii underlies the development of synergistic dual species communities. contact with s. gordonii initiates signal transduction within p. gingivalis that  is based on protein tyrosine (de)phosphorylation. in this study, we characterize  a bacterial tyrosine (by) kinase (designated ptk1) of p. gingivalis and demonstrate its involvement in interspecies signaling. ptk1 can utilize atp for autophosphorylation and is dephosphorylated by the p. gingivalis tyrosine phosphatase, ltp1. community development with s. gordonii is severely abrogated in a ptk1 mutant of p. gingivalis, indicating that tyrosine kinase activity is required for maximal polymicrobial synergy. ptk1 controls the levels of the transcriptional regulator cdhr and the fimbrial adhesin mfa1 which mediates binding to s. gordonii. the ptk1 gene is in an operon with two genes involved in  exopolysaccharide synthesis, and similar to other by kinases, ptk1 is necessary for exopolysaccharide production in p. gingivalis. ptk1 can phosphorylate the capsule related proteins pgn_0224, a udp-acetyl-mannosamine dehydrogenase, and pgn_0613, a udp-glucose dehydrogenase, in p. gingivalis. knockout of ptk1 in an encapsulated strain of p. gingivalis resulted in loss of capsule production. collectively these results demonstrate that the p. gingivalis ptk1 by kinase regulates interspecies communication and controls heterotypic community development with s. gordonii through adjusting the levels of the mfa1 adhesin and exopolysaccharide.

TI  == a periodontitis-associated multispecies model of an oral biofilm.
AB  == purpose: while single-species biofilms have been studied extensively, we know notably little regarding multispecies biofilms and their interactions. the purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an in vitro multispecies dental biofilm model that aimed to mimic the environment of chronic periodontitis. methods: streptococcus gordonii kn1, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc23726, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc33384, and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277 were used for this experiment. the biofilms were grown on 12-well plates with a round glass slip (12 mm in diameter) with a supply of fresh medium. four different single-species biofilms and multispecies biofilms with the four bacterial strains listed above were prepared. the biofilms were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (clsm) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for four different planktonic single-species and multispecies bacteria were determined. the mics of doxycycline and chlorhexidine for four different single-species biofilms and a multispecies biofilm were also determined. results: the clsm and sem examination revealed that the growth pattern of the multispecies biofilm was similar to those of single-species biofilms. however, the multispecies biofilm became thicker than the single-species biofilms, and networks between bacteria were formed. the mics  of doxycycline and chlorhexidine were higher in the biofilm state than in the planktonic bacteria. the mic of doxycycline for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, or a. actinomycetemcomitans. the mic of chlorhexidine for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. conclusions: to mimic the natural dental biofilm, a multispecies biofilm composed of four bacterial species was grown. the 24-hour multispecies biofilm may be useful as a laboratory dental biofilm model system.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == photodynamic therapy versus ultrasonic irrigation: interaction with endodontic microbial biofilm, an ex vivo study.
AB  == introduction: photodynamic therapy was introduced as an adjuvant to conventional  chemo-mechanical debridement during endodontic treatment to overcome the persistence of biofilms. the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of photodynamic therapy (pdt) to disrupt an experimental microbial biofilm inside the root canal in a clinically applicable working time. materials and methods: thirty extracted teeth were prepared and then divided in three groups. all samples were infected with an artificially formed biofilm made of enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia bacteria. first group was treated with aseptim plus(r) photo-activated (led) disinfection system, second group by a 650 nm diode laser and toluidine blue as photosensitizer, and the third group, as control group, by ultrasonic irrigation (pui) using edta 17% and naocl 2.6% solutions. the working time for all three groups was fixed at 3 min. presence or absence of biofilm was assessed  by aerobic and anaerobic cultures. results: there was no statistically significant difference between results obtained from groups treated by aseptim plus(r) and diode laser (p<0.6267). in cultures of both groups there was a maximal bacterial growth. the group that was treated by ultrasonic irrigation and naocl and edta solutions had the best results (p<0.0001): there was a statistically significant reduction of bacterial load and destruction of microbial biofilm. conclusion: under the condition of this study, photodynamic therapy could not disrupt endodontic artificial microbial biofilm and could not inhibit bacterial growth in a clinically favorable working time.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == pyrano-isoflavans from glycyrrhiza uralensis with antibacterial activity against  streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == continuing investigation of fractions from a supercritical fluid extract of chinese licorice (glycyrrhiza uralensis) roots has led to the isolation of 12 phenolic compounds, of which seven were described previously from this extract. in addition to these seven metabolites, four known components, 1-methoxyerythrabyssin ii (4), 6,8-diprenylgenistein, gancaonin g (5), and isoglycyrol (6), and one new isoflavan, licorisoflavan c (7), were characterized  from this material for the first time. treatment of licoricidin (1) with palladium chloride afforded larger amounts of 7 and also yielded two new isoflavans, licorisoflavan d (8), which was subsequently detected in the licorice extract, and licorisoflavan e (9). compounds 1-9 were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against the cariogenic streptococcus mutans and the periodontopathogenic porphyromonas gingivalis. licoricidin (1), licorisoflavan a  (2), and 7-9 showed antibacterial activity against p. gingivalis (mics of 1.56-12.5 mug/ml). the most potent activity against s. mutans was obtained with 7 (mic of 6.25 mug/ml), followed by 1 and 9 (mic of 12.5 mug/ml). this study provides further evidence for the therapeutic potential of licorice extracts for  the treatment and prevention of oral infections.

TI  == prevotella intermedia induces severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in mice with upregulated platelet-activating factor receptor expression.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of respiratory infection worldwide. although oral hygiene has been considered a risk factor for developing pneumonia, the relationship between oral bacteria and pneumococcal infection is unknown. in  this study, we examined the synergic effects of prevotella intermedia, a major periodontopathic bacterium, on pneumococcal pneumonia. the synergic effects of the supernatant of p. intermedia (pisup) on pneumococcal pneumonia were investigated in mice, and the stimulation of pneumococcal adhesion to human alveolar (a549) cells by pisup was assessed. the effects of pisup on platelet-activating factor receptor (pafr) transcript levels in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr, and the differences between the effects of pneumococcal infection induced by various periodontopathic bacterial species were verified in mice. mice inoculated with s. pneumoniae plus pisup exhibited a significantly lower survival rate, higher bacterial loads in the lungs, spleen, and blood, and higher inflammatory cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) than those infected without pisup. in a549 cells, pisup increased pneumococcal adhesion and pafr transcript levels. pisup also increased  lung pafr transcript levels in mice. similar effects were not observed in the supernatants of porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum. thus, p. intermedia has the potential to induce severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia with enhanced pneumococcal adhesion to lower airway cells.

AB  == introduction: uncontrolled bacteria of dental plaque generate formation of oral biofilm located on teeth and subgingival surfaces. it may induce local inflammation (gingivitis) with further development of periodontal diseases. a variety of oral bacteria such as streptococcus mutans and porhyromonas gingivalis are involved in pathogenesis of dental carries and periodontitis. very often bacterial infections are associated with candidiasis (candida albicans). chlorhexidine (chx) is the most commonly used antiseptic in dentistry due to its  strong antibacterial activity and capacity to reduce the accumulation of oral biofilms. however, other antiseptics, especially endodontic irrigants, are still  tested to improve their preventive and therapeutic effects in oral cavity infections. in this in vitro study we have compared antimicrobial activity of chx with that of taurine chloramine (tauc1) and taurine bromamine (taubr), natural taurine derivatives with known antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: antimicrobial activity of chx, tauc1 and taubr was tested by incubation  of the compounds with s. mutans, p gingivalis and c. albicans. the agents were incubated in low (105/ml) and high (108/ml) density microbe suspensions, related  to early and late biofilm infections, respectively. in some experiments bacteria  were incubated with a combination of chx + naocl and chx + taubr. mic was determined by the pour-plate method. results: chx showed the strongest antimicrobial activity against all tested pathogens. on the contrary, tauc1 was the weakest antiseptics used without effect on the growth of c. albicans. taubr at non-cytotoxic concentrations inhibited the growth of s. mutans and p gingivalis with slight effect on the low density c. albicans. all tested agents showed weaker antiseptic properties in the presence of serum. moreover, we have shown that interactions between chx and sodium hypochlorite (naoc1), the main endodontic irrigant, but not between chx and taubr,resulted in precipitation. therefore, it may restrict their simultaneous application in root canal treatment. however, in spite of this unwanted reaction, the mixture of chx with naocl kills pathogens more effectively then chx alone. conclusions: the results confirmed chx exceptional potential as primary antiseptic in dentistry, especially in prevention and treatment of dental carries, periodontal diseases and mouth candidiasis. moreover, our study shows that taubr may be used alternatively or in combination with chx in killing of oral pathogens, due to its strong antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  == phototargeting human periodontal pathogens in vivo.
AB  == the effects of blue light at 455 nm were investigated on the bacterial composition of human dental plaque in vivo. eleven subjects who refrained from brushing for 3 days before and during phototherapy participated in the study. light with a power density of 70 mw/cm(2) was applied to the buccal surfaces of premolar and molar teeth on one side of the mouth twice daily for 2 min over a period of 4 days. dental plaque was harvested at baseline and again at the end of 4 days from eight posterior teeth on both the exposed side and unexposed sides of the mouth. microbiological changes were monitored by checkerboard dna probe analysis of 40 periodontal bacteria. the proportions of black-pigmented species porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced on  the exposed side from their original proportions by 25 and 56 %, respectively, while no change was observed to the unexposed side. five other species showed the greatest proportional reduction of the light-exposed side relative to the unexposed side. these species were streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, and capnocytophaga sputigena. at the same time, the percentage of  gingival areas scored as being red decreased on the side exposed to light from 48 to 42 %, whereas the percentage scored as red increased on the unexposed side from 53 to 56 %. no adverse effects were found or reported in this study. the present study proposes a new method to modify the ecosystem in dental plaque by phototherapy and introduces a new avenue of prophylactic treatment for periodontal diseases.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

AB  == aim: the study was carried out to see the diversity of oral microflora and its antibiotic sensitivity test in children of age group 6 to 12 years was carried. materials and methods: total 50 patients of age group 6 to 12 years were analyzed for their oral microflora and then checked for the antibiotic susceptibility test. the samples that were collected were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. once dispersed samples were taken and gram staining was done, also they were spread on to a number of freshly prepared agar plates and incubated to allow cells to form microbial colony. results: the result showed microflora common in all types, gram-positive facultative anaerobic rods and cocci. in normal children gram-positive facultative anaerobic and fermenting cocci were predominant where as in children with caries growth of microbiota that were gram-negative and positive, capnophilic, motile and anaerobic rods and cocci belonging to members of genera s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans was seen. conclusion: by the present study it has been concluded that the number of bacteria determined by microscopic counts was twice as high in caries patients as in healthy sites, and  also recommended that amoxicillin, ampicillin and amikacin are the most effective antibacterial drugs for the treatment of dental caries.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on epithelial cell migration in vitro.
AB  == oral ulcerations often arise as a side effect from chemo- and radiation therapy.  in a previous clinical study, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified as a positive predictor for oral ulcerations after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, possibly incriminating p. gingivalis in delayed healing of the ulcerations. therefore, it was tested whether p. gingivalis and its secreted products could inhibit the migration of oral epithelial cells in an in vitro scratch assay. to compare, the oral bacteria prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and streptococcus mitis were included. a standardized scratch was made in a confluent layer of human oral epithelial cells. the epithelial cells were challenged with bacterial cells and with medium  containing secretions of these bacteria. closure of the scratch was measured after 17 h using a phase contrast microscope. p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and secretions of p. gingivalis strongly inhibited cell migration. a challenge with 1000 heat-killed bacteria versus 1 epithelial cell resulted in a relative closure of the scratch of 25% for p. gingivalis and 20% for p. nigrescens. weaker inhibitory effects were found for the other bacteria. the results confirmed our hypothesis that the oral bacteria may be involved in delayed wound healing.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

AB  == aim. this study investigated the effect of dodonaea viscosa var. angustifolia (dva) on the virulence properties of cariogenic streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis implicated in periodontal diseases. methods. s. mutans was cultured in tryptone broth containing a crude leaf extract of dva for 16 hours, and the ph was measured after 10, 12, 14, and 16 h. biofilms of s. mutans  were grown on glass slides for 48 hours and exposed to plant extract for 30 minutes; the adherent cells were reincubated and the ph was measured at various time intervals. minimum bactericidal concentration of the extracts against the four periodontal pathogens was determined. the effect of the subinhibitory concentration of plant extract on the production of proteinases by p. gingivalis  was also evaluated. results. dva had no effect on acid production by s. mutans biofilms; however, it significantly inhibited acid production in planktonic cells. periodontal pathogens were completely eliminated at low concentrations ranging from 0.09 to 0.02 mg/ml of crude plant extracts. at subinhibitory concentrations, dva significantly reduced arg-gingipain (24%) and lys-gingipain (53%) production by p. gingivalis (p </= 0.01). conclusions. these results suggest that dva has the potential to be used to control oral infections including dental caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == does photodynamic therapy enhance standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry?
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to assess whether or not photodynamic therapy enhanced standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry. background data: photodynamic therapy when used as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy  kills more bacteria than when conventional periodontal therapy is used alone. materials and methods: to address the focused question, "does photodynamic therapy enhance killing of oral bacteria?" pubmed/medline((r)) and google scholar databases were explored. original human and experimental studies and studies using photodynamic therapy for killing oral bacteria were included. letters to the editor, historic reviews, and unpublished data were excluded. results: photodynamic therapy significantly reduces periodontopathogenic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis. photodynamic therapy kills cariogenic bacteria (such as streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis), bacteria associated with infected root canals, and those associated with periimplantitis. conclusions: photodynamic therapy, when used as an adjunct to conventional oral disinfection protocols, enhances standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry.

AB  == aim: although the complexity of the oral ecology and the ecological differences between health and disease are well accepted, a clear view on the dynamics in relation to disease is lacking. in this study, the prevalence and abundance of 20 key oral bacteria was assessed in health and disease and more importantly a closer look was given to the inter-bacterial relationships. materials and methods: a blinded microbiological database was analysed in this cross-sectional, retrospective study. the database was constructed based on microbiological analyses of samples from 6308 patients, with gradations of periodontitis (healthy to periodontitis). data concerning the abundance of 20 oral bacteria and probing  pocket depth were provided. results: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas micra and porphyromonas intermedia showed a clear increase in abundance and prevalence with increasing pocket depth. correlation matrices illustrated that almost all microorganisms were in one way correlated to other species and most of these correlations were significant. several beneficial bacteria showed strong correlations with other beneficial bacteria. conclusion: knowledge on bacterial correlations can pave the way for new treatment options focusing on restoring the shifted balance.

TI  == oral community interactions of filifactor alocis in vitro.
AB  == filifactor alocis is a gram positive anaerobe that is emerging as an important periodontal pathogen. in the oral cavity f. alocis colonizes polymicrobial biofilm communities; however, little is known regarding the nature of the interactions between f. alocis and other oral biofilm bacteria. here we investigate the community interactions of two strains of f. alocis with streptococcus gordonii, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, organisms with differing pathogenic potential in the oral cavity. in an in vitro community development model, s. gordonii was antagonistic to the accumulation of f. alocis into a dual species community. in contrast, f. nucleatum and the type strain of f. alocis formed a synergistic partnership. accumulation of a low passage isolate of f. alocis was also enhanced by f. nucleatum. in three species communities of s. gordonii, f. nucleatum and f. alocis, the antagonistic effects of s. gordonii superseded the synergistic effects of f. nucleatum toward f. alocis. the interaction between a.  actinomycetemcomitans and f. alocis was strain specific and a. actinomycetemcomitans could either stimulate f. alocis accumulation or have no effect depending on the strain. p. gingivalis and f. alocis formed heterotypic communities with the amount of p. gingivalis greater than in the absence of f. alocis. however, while p. gingivalis benefited from the relationship, levels of f. alocis in the dual species community were lower compared to f. alocis alone. the inhibitory effect of p. gingivalis toward f. alocis was dependent, at least partially, on the presence of the mfa1 fimbrial subunit. in addition, ai-2 production by p. gingivalis helped maintain levels of f. alocis. collectively, these results show that the pattern of f. alocis colonization will be dictated by the spatial composition of microbial microenvironments, and that the organism may preferentially accumulate at sites rich in f. nucleatum.

TI  == synergistic effect of proanthocyanidin on the bactericidal action of the photolysis of h2o2.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of the hydroxyl radical generation system by  the photolysis of h2o2 in combination with proanthocyanidin, which refers to a group of polyphenolic compounds, was examined. bactericidal activity of photo-irradiated h2o2 at 405 nm against streptococcus mutans, a major pathogen of dental caries, was augmented in the presence of proanthocyanidin, whose bactericidal effect by itself was very poor, in a concentration-dependent manner. this combination was also proven effective against porphyromonas gingivalis, a major pathogen of periodontitis. it is speculated that h2o2, generated from photo-irradiated proanthocyanidin around the bacterial cells, is photolyzed to the hydroxyl radical, which would in turn affect the membrane structure and function of the bacterial cells, resulting in augmented sensitivity of bacterial  cells to the disinfection system utilizing the photolysis of h2o2. the present study suggests that the combination of h2o2 and proanthocyanidin works synergistically to kill bacteria when photo-irradiated.

TI  == effects of oral implant surface roughness on bacterial biofilm formation and treatment efficacy.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of oral implant surface roughness on bacterial biofilm formation and antimicrobial treatment efficacy. materials and methods: titanium disks with low-roughness pickled surfaces and with moderately rough sandblasted, acid-etched surfaces were used as substrata. streptococcus mutans biofilms (1 and 3 days old) and porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms (3 days old) were grown on the two types of substrata and then treated with 0.2% chlorhexidine. biofilm viability was evaluated by a resazurin metabolism assay and by sonication-colony-forming unit counts. results: surface roughness had no influence on the amount of biofilm formation by s mutans or p gingivalis in this in vitro biofilm model. however, it strongly affected the treatment efficacy of chlorhexidine on the biofilms formed by both species. higher roughness resulted in lower efficacy. furthermore, treatment efficacy was  significantly reduced in older biofilms. conclusion: a moderately roughened surface did not enhance biofilm formation but reduced treatment efficacy of the biofilms. this finding indicates that efforts should be directed toward optimizing implant surface properties for effective antimicrobial treatment without compromising osseointegration.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == an in vitro study of alginate oligomer therapies on oral biofilms.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro effect of a novel, oligosaccharide nanomedicine oligog against oral pathogen-related biofilms, both alone and in the presence of the conventional anti-bacterial agent triclosan, was evaluated. methods: the effect of oligog+/-triclosan was assessed against established streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms by bacterial counts and image analysis using live/dead((r)) staining and atomic force microscopy (afm). the effect of triclosan and oligog surface pre-treatments on bacterial attachment to titanium and polymethylmethacrylate was also studied. results: oligog potentiated the antimicrobial effect of triclosan, particularly when used in combination at 0.3%  against s. mutans grown in artificial saliva. oligog was less effective against established p. gingivalis biofilms. however, attachment of p. gingivalis, to titanium in particular, was significantly reduced after surface pre-treatment with oligog and triclosan at 0.01% when compared to controls. light microscopy and afm showed that oligog was biocidal to p. gingivalis, but not s. mutans. conclusions: oligog and triclosan when used in combination produced an enhanced antimicrobial effect against two important oral pathogens and reduced bacterial attachment to dental materials such as titanium, even at reduced triclosan concentrations. whilst the use of triclosan against oral bacteria has been widely documented, its synergistic use with oligog described here, has not previously been reported. the use of lower concentrations of triclosan, if used in combination therapy with oligog, could have environmental benefits. clinical importance: the potentiation of antimicrobial agents by naturally occurring oligomers such as oligog may represent a novel, safe adjunct to conventional oral hygiene and periodontal therapy. the ability of oligog to inhibit the growth and  impair bacterial adherence highlights its potential in the management of peri-implantitis.

TI  == erythritol alters microstructure and metabolomic profiles of biofilm composed of  streptococcus gordonii and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the effects of sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol, and sorbitol on periodontopathic biofilm are poorly understood, though they have often been reported to be non-cariogenic sweeteners. in the present study, we evaluated the  efficacy of sugar alcohols for inhibiting periodontopathic biofilm formation using a heterotypic biofilm model composed of an oral inhabitant streptococcus gordonii and a periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. confocal microscopic observations showed that the most effective reagent to reduce p. gingivalis accumulation onto an s. gordonii substratum was erythritol, as compared with xylitol and sorbitol. in addition, erythritol moderately suppressed s. gordonii monotypic biofilm formation. to examine the inhibitory effects of erythritol, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of erythritol-treated p. gingivalis and s. gordonii cells. metabolome analyses using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed that a number of nucleic intermediates and constituents of the extracellular matrix, such as nucleotide sugars, were decreased by erythritol in a dose-dependent manner. next, comparative analyses of metabolites of erythritol- and sorbitol-treated cells were performed using both organisms to determine the erythritol-specific effects. in p. gingivalis, all detected dipeptides, including glu-glu, ser-glu, tyr-glu, ala-ala and thr-asp, were significantly decreased by erythritol, whereas they tended to be increased by sorbitol. meanwhile, sorbitol promoted trehalose 6-phosphate accumulation in s. gordonii cells. these results suggest that erythritol has inhibitory effects on dual species biofilm development via several pathways, including suppression of growth resulting from dna and rna depletion, attenuated extracellular matrix production, and alterations of dipeptide acquisition and amino acid metabolism.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

TI  == oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of ll-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == some agents, including escherichia coli and group a streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. ll-37 is a human host defence peptide shown  previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. however, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of ll-37 remains obscure. in order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on ll-37's activity against e. coli and s. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly  used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (porphyromonas gingivalis and  fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates  as indicated by the growth curves generated. the sensitivities of e. coli and s.  pyogenes to ll-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. the oxygen facultative e. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to ll-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. the microaerophilic pathogen s. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to ll-37 under oxygen deprivation. our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.

TI  == validation of antibiotic efficacy on in vitro subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: systemic antibiotics are often used as adjunctive treatment modalities for periodontal diseases. testing of antimicrobial efficacy can be relevant only if the bacteria are in the form of biofilms rather than the planktonic state, and at concentrations of physiologic relevance, i.e., reachable in the periodontal pocket. the aim of the present study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of five common antibiotic schemes at physiologically relevant concentrations on a multispecies in vitro biofilm model. methods: a 10-species in vitro subgingival biofilm model was exposed to metronidazole (15 mug/ml), amoxicillin (15 mug/ml), metronidazole and amoxicillin in combination, doxycycline (2 mug/ml), and azithromycin (10 mug/ml) over 24 hours. species-specific bacterial numbers were determined by culture on selective agar media or by epifluorescence microscopy. results: metronidazole alone did not affect biofilm composition. total bacterial counts were significantly reduced by  doxycycline, azithromycin, and amoxicillin alone or in combination with metronidazole, albeit by less than 1 log. on the species-specific level, these regimens significantly reduced the numbers of streptococcus anginosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as campylobacter rectus (except for amoxicillin alone). the strongest effects were displayed by the combination of amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: antibiotics at concentrations detectable in gingival crevicular fluid do not dramatically reduce total bacterial loads in this in vitro biofilm model, but cause species-specific  reductions, which may disrupt the biofilm unity.

TI  == the microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  == background: oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants  and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. materials and methods: twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. the samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures.  in order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. the colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. alterations in the  presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using  analysis of variance (anova) with tukey's test post hoc. results: the average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. the bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. conclusion: the anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number  of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.

TI  == mobile microbiome: oral bacteria in extra-oral infections and inflammation.
AB  == the link between oral infections and adverse systemic conditions has attracted much attention in the research community. several mechanisms have been proposed,  including spread of the oral infection due to transient bacteremia resulting in bacterial colonization in extra-oral sites, systemic injury by free toxins of oral pathogens, and systemic inflammation caused by soluble antigens of oral pathogens. mounting evidence supports a major role of the systemic spread of oral commensals and pathogens to distant body sites causing extra-oral infections and  inflammation. we review here the most recent findings on systemic infections and  inflammation complicated by oral bacteria, including cardiovascular disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and  colorectal cancer, respiratory tract infections, and organ inflammations and abscesses. the recently identified virulence mechanisms of oral species fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and campylobacter rectus are also reviewed. a pattern emerges indicating that only select subtype(s) of a given species, e.g., f. nucleatum subspecies animalis and  polymorphum and s. mutans non-c serotypes, are prone to extra-oral translocation. these findings advocate the importance of identification and quantification of potential pathogens at the subtype levels for accurate prediction of disease potential.

TI  == altered phenotype and function of dendritic cells in individuals with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

TI  == microcalorimetric determination of the effects of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and their combination on in vitro biofilm.
AB  == background: the mechanism of action of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the treatment of peri-implantitis is not well understood. the aim of this study is to investigate antibiotic susceptibility of an in vitro biofilm by isothermal microcalorimetry (imc). methods: titanium disks containing a 72-hour three-species biofilm (streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068, fusobacterium nucleatum  atcc10953, and porphyromonas gingivalis dsm20709) were placed in a series of imc  ampoules with nutrient agar supplemented with increasing concentrations of amoxicillin, metronidazole, or their combination and incubated anaerobically for  10 days. lag time and maximum growth rate were determined from continuous heat-flow recordings of metabolic activity. to validate the imc biofilm results,  adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis were incubated anaerobically in medium supplemented with antibiotics at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and their vitality was determined by live/dead staining, conventional culturing, and imc. results: in all biofilm samples incubated with antibiotics, a prolonged lag phase was observed compared with controls (p <0.05). maximum growth rate was significantly  lower for samples treated with either amoxicillin or metronidazole compared with  controls (p <0.05). combining the antibiotics did not improve this effect. concentrations exceeding 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentration completely inhibited the growth of adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis, whereas lower concentrations resulted in only a delay in the lag phase. a poor correlation was  observed between live/dead staining and conventional culturing. conclusions: imc  gives new evidence about antibiotic effects on oral biofilms and is more informative than conventional culture and live/dead assays. the combination of antibiotics was found to be more efficient than metronidazole alone; however, only minor differences in growth inhibition were detected compared with amoxicillin alone.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  == laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in korea, japan, and china. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of  l. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of  l. japonica extracts in dental care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined  in culture medium using a microdilution method. the mics of ethanol extracts of l. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the mbcs were 125-1000 mug/ml. the mics of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. the mbcs of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. the mics were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the killing of streptococcus mutans and p. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. the killing of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. bacterial treatment with l. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis. the results of this study suggest that l. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == effects of er:yag laser on bacteria associated with titanium surfaces and cellular response in vitro.
AB  == this in vitro study examined (a) the anti-bacterial efficacy of a pulsed erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (er:yag) laser applied to streptococcus sanguinis or porphyromonas gingivalis adhered to either polished or microstructured titanium implant surfaces, (b) the response of osteoblast-like cells and (c) adhesion of oral bacteria to titanium surfaces after laser irradiation. thereto, (a) bacteria adhered to titanium disks were irradiated with a pulsed er:yag laser (lambda = 2,940 nm) at two different power settings: a lower mode (12.74 j/cm(2) calculated energy density) and a higher mode (63.69 j/cm(2)). (b) after laser irradiation with both settings of sterile titanium, disks were seeded with 10(4) mg-63 cells/cm(2). adhesion and proliferation were determined after 1, 4, and 24 h by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron  microscopy. (c) bacterial adhesion was also studied on irradiated (test) and non-irradiated (control) surfaces. adhered p. gingivalis were effectively killed, even at the lower laser setting, independent of the material's surface. s. sanguinis cells adhered were effectively killed only at the higher setting of 63.69 j/cm(2). laser irradiation of titanium surfaces had no significant effects  on (b) adhesion or proliferation of osteoblast-like mg-63 cells or (c) adhesion of both oral bacterial species in comparison to untreated surfaces. an effective  decontamination of polished and rough titanium implant surfaces with a er:yag laser could only be achieved with a fluence of 63.69 j/cm(2). even though this setting may lead to certain surface alterations, no significant adverse effect on subsequent colonization and proliferation of mg-63 cells or increased bacterial adhesion was found in comparison to untreated control surfaces.

TI  == molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == the human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. this study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. an in-depth 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. a complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. this included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found  in all samples regardless of age and health status. yet, haemophilus influenzae,  neisseria species, and streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected  in children. in contrast, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. obligate anaerobes like porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of porphyromonas and prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and tannerella forsythia. unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus intermedius and prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were scarce. the findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. the study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.

AB  == background: previous studies have shown antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity of alkaline extract of the leaves of sasa senanensis rehder (se). in order to manufacture an se-containing toothpaste for combating oral diseases, we investigated the possible interaction between the candidate ingredients of toothpaste: se, isopropyl methylphenol (ipmp, antibacterial agent) and charcoal prepared from sasa senanensis rehder. materials and methods: cell viability of mock-infected, hiv-infected and uv-irradiated cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. superoxide radical scavenging activity was determined by electron-spin resonance  spectroscopy. antibacterial activity against porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and streptococcus mutans atcc25175 was determined by the turbidity assay. results: exposure to less than 50% se or less than 0.31 mm ipmp for 10 min scarcely damaged human cultured gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts. both se and ipmp showed bi-modal action, stimulating the bacterial growth at lower concentrations, but synergistically inhibiting it at higher concentrations. addition of extremely high concentrations of charcoal enhanced both anti-hiv and  anti-uv activity of se. conclusion: practically, addition of charcoal may not be  recommendable, since one or two orders higher concentrations of charcoal as compared with se, are required to achieve the synergistic effect for anti-hiv and anti-uv activity. rather, addition of about one tenth of the amount of ipmp may be recommendable for enhancing the antibacterial activity.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

AB  == we examined whether colonization of selected oral pathogens is associated with gastric precancerous lesions in a cross-sectional study. a total of 119 participants were included, of which 37 were cases of chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, or dysplasia. an oral examination was performed to measure periodontal indices. plaque and saliva samples were tested with real-time quantitative pcr for dna levels of pathogens related to periodontal disease (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) and dental caries (streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus). there were no consistent associations between dna levels of selected bacterial species and gastric precancerous lesions, although an elevated but non-significant odds ratio (or) for gastric precancerous lesions was observed in relation to increasing colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans (or = 1.36 for one standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval = 0.87-2.12), p. gingivalis (or = 1.12, 0.67-1.88) and t. denticola (or = 1.34, 0.83-2.12) measured in plaque. to assess the influence of specific long-term infection, stratified analyses by levels of periodontal indices were conducted. a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly associated with gastric precancerous lesions (or = 2.51, 1.13-5.56) among those with >/= median of percent tooth sites with pd >/= 3 mm, compared with no association among those below the median (or = 0.86, 0.43-1.72). a significantly stronger relationship was observed between the  cumulative bacterial burden score of periodontal disease-related pathogens and gastric precancerous lesions among those with higher versus lower levels of periodontal disease indices (p-values for interactions: 0.03-0.06). among individuals with periodontal disease, high levels of colonization of periodontal  pathogens are associated with an increased risk of gastric precancerous lesions.

TI  == oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  == this report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. streptococcus gordonii (sg)/s. oralis (so)/s. sanguinis (ss) and sg/fusobacterium nucleatum (fn)/porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of il-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an  additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. only the sg/actinomyces naeslundii  (an)/fn multispecies biofilms elicited il-6 levels above those of control. il-8 was a primary response to the sg/an/fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. these results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.

TI  == comprehensive microbiological findings in peri-implantitis and periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial differences between peri-implantitis and periodontitis in the  same subjects were examined using 16s rrna gene clone library analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. materials and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets of peri-implantitis and periodontitis sites in six subjects. the prevalence of bacteria was analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 333 different taxa were identified from 799 sequenced clones; 231 (69%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which 75 were novel. the numbers of bacterial taxa identified at the sites of peri-implantitis and periodontitis were 192 and 148 respectively. the microbial composition of peri-implantitis was more diverse when compared with that of periodontitis. fusobacterium spp. and streptococcus spp. were predominant in both peri-implantitis and periodontitis, while bacteria such  as parvimonas micra were only detected in peri-implantitis. the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was not high, while quantitative evaluation revealed that, in most cases, prevalence was higher at peri-implantitis sites than at periodontitis sites. conclusions: the biofilm in peri-implantitis showed a more complex microbial composition when compared with periodontitis. common periodontopathic bacteria showed low prevalence, and several bacteria were identified as candidate pathogens in peri-implantitis.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

AB  == coaggregation of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral streptococci is thought to play an important role in p. gingivalis colonization. previously, we reported that p. gingivalis major fimbriae interacted with streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and that amino acid residues 166 to 183 of gapdh exhibited strong binding activity toward p. gingivalis fimbriae (h. nagata, m. iwasaki, k. maeda, m. kuboniwa, e. hashino, m. toe, n. minamino, h. kuwahara, and s. shizukuishi, infect. immun. 77:5130-5138, 2009). the present study aimed to identify and characterize p. gingivalis components other than fimbriae that interact with s. oralis gapdh. a pulldown assay was performed to detect potential interactions between p. gingivalis client proteins  and s. oralis recombinant gapdh with amino acid residues 166 to 183 deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. seven proteins, namely, tonb-dependent receptor protein (raga4), arginine-specific proteinase b, 4-hydroxybutyryl-coenzyme a dehydratase (abfd), lysine-specific proteinase, gapdh, nad-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and malate dehydrogenase (mdh), were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by proteomic analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. interactions between these client proteins and s. oralis gapdh were analyzed with a biomolecular interaction analysis system. s. oralis gapdh showed high affinity for five of the seven client proteins (raga4, abfd, gapdh, gdh, and mdh). interactions between p. gingivalis and s. oralis were measured by  a turbidimetric method and fluorescence microscopy. raga4, abfd, and gdh enhanced coaggregation, whereas gapdh and mdh inhibited coaggregation. furthermore, the expression of luxs in p. gingivalis was upregulated by raga4, abfd, and gdh but was downregulated by mdh. these results indicate that the five p. gingivalis client proteins function as regulators in p. gingivalis biofilm formation with oral streptococci.

TI  == microbial interactions in building of communities.
AB  == establishment of a community is considered to be essential for microbial growth and survival in the human oral cavity. biofilm communities have increased resilience to physical forces, antimicrobial agents and nutritional variations. specific cell-to-cell adherence processes, mediated by adhesin-receptor pairings  on respective microbial surfaces, are able to direct community development. these interactions co-localize species in mutually beneficial relationships, such as streptococci, veillonellae, porphyromonas gingivalis and candida albicans. in transition from the planktonic mode of growth to a biofilm community, microorganisms undergo major transcriptional and proteomic changes. these occur in response to sensing of diffusible signals, such as autoinducer molecules, and  to contact with host tissues or other microbial cells. underpinning many of these processes are intracellular phosphorylation events that regulate a large number of microbial interactions relevant to community formation and development.

TI  == arginine deiminase inhibits porphyromonas gingivalis surface attachment.
AB  == the oral cavity is host to a complex microbial community whose maintenance depends on an array of cell-to-cell interactions and communication networks, with little known regarding the nature of the signals or mechanisms by which they are  sensed and transmitted. determining the signals that control attachment, biofilm  development and outgrowth of oral pathogens is fundamental to understanding pathogenic biofilm development. we have previously identified a secreted arginine deiminase (adi) produced by streptococcus intermedius that inhibited biofilm development of the commensal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis through downregulation of genes encoding the major (fima) and minor (mfa1) fimbriae, both of which are required for proper biofilm development. here we report that this inhibitory effect is dependent on enzymic activity. we have successfully cloned,  expressed and defined the conditions to ensure that adi from s. intermedius is enzymically active. along with the cloning of the wild-type allele, we have created a catalytic mutant (adic399s), in which the resulting protein is not able to catalyse the hydrolysis of l-arginine to l-citrulline. p. gingivalis is insensitive to the adic399s catalytic mutant, demonstrating that enzymic activity is required for the effects of adi on biofilm formation. biofilm formation is absent under l-arginine-deplete conditions, and can be recovered by the addition  of the amino acid. taken together, the results indicate that arginine is an important signal that directs biofilm formation by this anaerobe. based on our findings, we postulate that adi functions to reduce arginine levels and, by a yet to be identified mechanism, signals p. gingivalis to alter biofilm development. adi release from the streptococcal cell and its cross-genera effects are important findings in understanding the nature of inter-bacterial signalling and  biofilm-mediated diseases of the oral cavity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity  against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings  suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral  lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.

TI  == microbial colonization in orthodontic mini-implants.
AB  == peri-implant inflammation contributes for loss of secondary stability of orthodontic mini-implants. the investigation of microbial colonization in this area would benefit its control, and consequently favor the long-term success of mini-implants. therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the establishment and the evolution of microbial colonization process in orthodontic  mini-implants for 3 months, since the time of their installation. one-hundred and fifty samples collected from 15 mini-implants were investigated from baseline up  to 3 months. the biological material was obtained from peri-implant area using paper points. nonspecific, streptococcus spp, lactobacillus casei and candida spp colonizations were analyzed by cell growth methods. porphyromonas gingivalis colonization was observed by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction. data from cell growth were submitted to the wilcoxon sign rank test and results from molecular analysis were presented in a descriptive way. there was no significant  difference in the microbial colonization among the examined time intervals, except for streptococcus spp, between baseline and 24 h, which characterized the  initial colonization in this time interval. lactobacillus casei and candida spp colonizations were insignificant. no porphyromonas gingivalis was detected among  the analyzed samples. the microbial colonization of mini-implants did not significantly change during the study. however, it should be monitored by orthodontists, since it is an important factor for mini-implants success.

TI  == optimization of quantitative polymerase chain reactions for detection and quantification of eight periodontal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tanerella forsythia and  treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen streptococcus mutans. results: eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using blast analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mfold). the most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qpcr-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility.  for the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of dna extracts from isolates of closely related species. for these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the applied biosystems 7300, the bio-rad iq5 and the roche light cycler 480). for all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. the overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the light cycler 480. conclusions: in conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of s. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus fusobacterium.this can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.

TI  == treponema denticola improves adhesive capacities of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important etiological agent of periodontal disease,  is frequently found associated with treponema denticola, an anaerobic spirochete, in pathogenic biofilms. however, interactions between these two bacteria are not  well understood at the molecular level. in this study, we seek to link the influence of t. denticola on the expression of p. gingivalis proteases with its capacities to adhere and to form biofilms. the p. gingivalis genes encoding arg-gingipain a (rgpa), lys-gingipain (kgp), and hemagglutinin a (haga) were more strongly expressed after incubation with t. denticola compared with p. gingivalis alone. the amounts of the three resulting proteins, all of which contain hemagglutinin adhesion domains, were increased in culture supernatants. moreover, incubation of p. gingivalis with t. denticola promoted static and dynamic biofilm formation, primarily via a time-dependent enhancement of p. gingivalis adhesion capacities on bacterial partners such as streptococcus gordonii. adhesion of p. gingivalis to human cells was also increased. these results showed that interactions of p. gingivalis with other bacterial species, such as t. denticola, induce increased adhesive capacities on various substrata by hemagglutinin adhesion domain-containing proteins.

TI  == binding of streptococcus gordonii to oral epithelial monolayers increases paracellular barrier function.
AB  == the junctional epithelium comprising the gingival attachment to the tooth acts as a barrier against pathogenic subgingival plaque microbes and their products. there is evidence that pathogenic porphyromonas gingivalis has the potential to disrupt epithelial integrity, contributing to breakdown of the junctional epithelium characteristic of the immunopathological response of chronic periodontitis. the present study investigated the capacity of the oral commensal  streptococcus gordonii to increase epithelial barrier function to support epithelial integrity of healthy tissue. oral epithelial barrier function was measured by permeability assay. changes in expression of tight junction components were monitored by quantitative real-time rt-pcr and western blot in an oral epithelial cell culture model following binding by s. gordonii strain fss2.  the data showed increased expression of genes encoding the tight junction components zo-1, zo-2, jam-a, and occludin at a ratio of 100 bacterial colony forming units per epithelial cell. this was associated with increased expression  at the protein level of zo-1, zo-2 and jam-a. reduction of permeability to fluorochrome-labelled dextran accompanied these changes. the data support the hypothesis that (some) commensal bacteria have a beneficial effect on oral epithelium.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial adhesion on machined titanium, osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) discs.
AB  == purpose: bacterial adhesion and colonization play a crucial function in the pathogenesis of peri-implant tissue infection, which is considered the main cause of fixture loss. the aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in bacterial adhesion between a machined titanium surface, a double acid etched surface (osseotite(r)) and an osseotite surface with nanometer-scale discrete crystalline deposition (dcd) of calcium phosphate (cap)(nanotite(r)). methods: surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (sem) observation. bacterial adhesion on machined, osseotite(r), and nanotite(r) discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: streptococcus mutans ccug 35176, streptococcus sanguis ccug 17826, streptococcus salivarius ccug 11878, actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans ccug 37002, porphyromonas gingivalis ccug 2521. the assessment of bacterial adhesion was performed by comparing two methods: total viable count (tvc) estimation and confocal laser scanning microscopic (cslm) studies. results: the surface roughness parameter increased as follows: machined<nanotite(r)<osseotite(r). the attachment of all bacterial strains performed by both methods showed a significant reduction on osseotite(r) and even higher on nanotite(r) in comparison to machined surfaces (p<0.05). the reduction  in bacterial attachment was more significant on osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) for  a. actinomycetecomitans, s. mutans and s. sanguis than for p. gingivalis and s. salivarius strains. conclusions: nanotite(r) samples showed the lowest amount of  bacterial contamination in comparison to the smoother machined and rougher osseotite(r) surfaces.

TI  == putative down-stream signaling molecule of gtpase in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a strict anaerobic bacterium mainly responsible for periodontal disease in oral cavity. putative gtpase gene (pgp) of this bacterium  was cloned and its recombinant protein (rpgp) was produced in escherichia coli. based on the amino acid sequence of sgp that is a gtp-binding protein of streptococcus mutans, putative gtpase amino acid sequence was deduced in the data base of genome sequences of porphyromonas gingivalis. a 900-bp pcr fragment was amplified with p. gingivalis genomic dna as a template and cloned into e. coli jm 109. then pgp was transferred into pqe-30 expression vector to make pqe-pgp for production of rpgr. this protein was produced and purified by ni-nta affinity column chromatography. anti-pgp antibody was also produced in sprague dawley rats. using westernblot analysis with this antibody, it was confirmed that the rpgp produced in e. coli was identical to that of donor strain. furthermore, by southernblot analysis it was revealed that the pgp was originated from p. gingivalis. by immunoprecipitation with anti-pgp antibody and n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis it was found that pgp was able to bind to acetate kinase,  which was reported to be a secondary signaling-molecule in anaerobic microorganisms. therefore, these results imply that p. gingivalis produces putative gtpase and this protein might play a potential role in signaling pathway in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == annexin-a1 protein and its relationship to cortisol in human saliva.
AB  == salivary cortisol is commonly used as a clinical biomarker of endocrine status and also as a marker of psychosocial stress. annexin-a1 (anxa1) is an anti-inflammatory protein whose expression is modulated by glucocorticoids. our principal objectives were to (i) detect the presence of and (ii) measure anxa1 protein in whole human saliva and to (iii) investigate whether salivary cortisol  and anxa1 are correlated in healthy humans. a total of 37 healthy participants (male and female) were used in the study. saliva was collected using salivette tubes. salivary cortisol and anxa1 protein were sampled at between 3 and 6 time points over 24h and measured for cortisol and anxa1 protein using specific elisa's. the presence of salivary anxa1 protein was confirmed by western blotting. anxa1 protein is detectable in whole human saliva, as detected by western blot analysis and elisa. a diurnal rhythm was evident in both salivary cortisol (p<0.01) and anxa1 (p<0.01) and was defined as a significant difference  in time 0 (waking) samples compared to 'bed' (2300 h) samples. anxa1 protein did  not exhibit an awakening response (p>0.05), whereas salivary cortisol was significantly elevated between time 0 and 30 min post waking (p<0.001). anxa1 protein correlates positively with salivary cortisol, indicating that cortisol is most likely a regulator of anxa1 in human saliva.

TI  == proteomics of streptococcus gordonii within a model developing oral microbial community.
AB  == background: streptococcus gordonii is one of several species that can initiate the formation of oral biofilms that develop into the complex multispecies microbial communities referred to as dental plaque. it is in the context of dental plaque that periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas gingivalis cause disease. we have previously reported a whole cell quantitative proteomics investigation of p. gingivalis in a model dental plaque community of s. gordonii, p. gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. here we report the adaptation of s. gordonii to the same model. results: 1122 s. gordonii proteins were detected in s. gordonii control samples, 915 in communities with f. nucleatum, 849 with p. gingivalis, and 649 with all three organisms. quantitative comparisons showed extensive proteome changes in association with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis individually or both p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum together. the changes were species specific, though the p. gingivalis interaction may be dominant, indicated by large differences between the proteomes with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis but limited changes between communities with p. gingivalis or both p. gingivalis and  f. nucleatum. the results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. extensive changes were seen in nutrition pathways with increases in energy metabolism and changes in the resulting byproducts, while the acid and sugar repressed pts (phosphoenolpyruvate dependent phosphotransferase system) sugar transport systems showed decreases. these results were seen across  all the multispecies samples, though with different profiles according to the partner species. f. nucleatum association decreased proteins for the metabolic end products acetate and ethanol but increased lactate, the primary source of acidity from streptococcal cultures. p. gingivalis containing samples had a reduction in levels of proteins for ethanol and formate but increased proteins for both acetate and lactate production. the communities also showed increases in exopolysaccharide synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and oxidative stress protection and decreases in adhesion and transporter proteins. conclusion: this study showed that s. gordonii demonstrates species specific responses during interactions with f. nucleatum or p. gingivalis. extensive changes were seen in energy metabolism and byproduct production implicating nutrient transfer as an important community interaction.

TI  == isothermal microcalorimetry provides new insights into biofilm variability and dynamics.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate a three-species in vitro biofilm with peri-implantitis-related bacteria for its variability and metabolic activity. streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were suspended in simulated body fluid containing 0.2% glucose to form biofilms on polished, protein-coated implant-grade titanium disks over 72 h using a flow chamber system. thereafter, biofilm-coated disks were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization/confocal laser scanning microscopy. to assess metabolic activity within the biofilms, their heat flow was recorded for 480 h at 37 degrees c by imc. the microscopic methods revealed that the total number of bacteria in the biofilms varied slightly among specimens (2.59 x 10(4) +/- 0.67 x 10(4) cells mm(-2) ), whereas all three species were found constantly with unchanged proportions (s. sanguinis  41.3 +/- 4.8%, f. nucleatum 17.7 +/- 2.1%, and p. gingivalis 41.0 +/- 4.9%). imc  revealed minor differences in time-to-peak heat flow (20.6 +/- 4.5 h), a trend consistent with the small variation in bacterial species proportions as shown by  microscopy. peak heat flow (35.8 +/- 42.6 muw), mean heat flow (13.1 +/- 22.0 muw), and total heat over 480 h (23.5 +/- 37.2 j) showed very high variation. these imc results may be attributed to differences in the initial cell counts and relative proportions of the three species, their distribution and embedment in exopolysaccharide matrix on the test specimens. the present results provide new insights into variability and dynamics of biofilms on titanium disks, aspects that should be explored in future studies of dental surfaces.

TI  == a molecular survey of s. mutans and p. gingivalis oral microbial burden in human  saliva using relative endpoint polymerase chain reaction (re-pcr) within the population of a nevada dental school revealed disparities among minorities.
AB  == background: the university of nevada, las vegas school of dental medicine recently opened an orthodontic treatment clinic to address the needs of the racially and ethnically diverse population of southern nevada, primarily focusing on the treatment and care of low-income and minority patients. although orthodontic treatment and therapy has been shown to induce changes in the oral cavity, much of this evidence was collected from traditional white, teenage orthodontic clinic populations. the primary goal of this study was to describe the microbial burden of the cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis within the unlv-sdm patient population. methods: representative saliva samples were collected from healthy adult patients for dna isolation. relative endpoint polymerase chain reaction (re-pcr) was performed to ascertain the presence and relative microbial burden of these oral pathogens. results: nearly one quarter (13/56) or 23.3% of these patients had elevated levels of s. mutans, while (10/56) and 17.8% of these samples were found to have elevated levels of p. gingivalis, - with (90%) of p. gingivalis-positive  samples from minority patients (x2=17.921, d.f. = 1; p<0.0001). conclusions: these findings of elevated p. gingivalis levels, primarily among minority patients, may suggest underlying oral health practices contributing to adverse oral health conditions within this population. oral health knowledge and practices among minority patients may be strongly influenced by other factors, including education and socioeconomic status, suggesting additional research may  be needed to accurately determine the most appropriate standards for care and oral health education within this patient population.

AB  == background: human beta-defensins (hbds) and the c-c chemokine ligand 20 (ccl20) produced by gingival epithelial cells (gecs) and fibroblasts (hgfs) are antimicrobial peptides (amps) that play an important role in innate immunity. the aim of this study was to determine the differential immune response of gecs and hgfs to the oral commensal streptococcus gordonii (sg) and the pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis (pg). material and methods: in addition to the analysis  of gingival biopsies, primary gecs and hgfs were exposed to sg and/or pg, and expression of various amps and pro-inflammatory mediators was studied by real-time pcr and elisa. results: gene expression of amps was detected in gingival connective tissue. both sg and pg induced the mrna-expression of hbd-2 and hbd-3 in gecs as well as hgfs after 24 h (p < 0.05). in hgfs, the commensal bacterium sg stimulated the mrnas of hbd-3 and ccl20 after 24 h (p < 0.05), while not in gecs. in gecs, the inductive effect of pg on the mrna-expression of hbd-2  was amplified when cells were first exposed to commensal sg (for 1 h) prior to stimulation with pg (sg-pg; p < 0.05). conclusion: our data indicate that cell-bacteria interactions and/or bacteria-bacteria cross-talk may have an impact on amp-regulation in gingiva.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

AB  == the compounds 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-geranyloxyacetophenone (1) and 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-farnesyloxy-acetophenone (2) are oxyprenylated secondary metabolites extracted from plants belonging to the rutaceae family. in this study, 1 and 2 were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial activity toward major oral pathogens. compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized by selective prenylation of 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone at the 4' position with geranyl and farnesyl bromide, respectively. compound 1 showed stronger antimicrobial activity than 2 against major oral pathogens, including gram positive bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus), gram negative bacteria (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis) and candida albicans. evidences were obtained that the mode of action of 1 and 2 may be related to their iron-chelating property. this study suggests that 1 and 2 may represent potential natural molecules for the prevention/treatment of common oral infections, including dental caries, periodontal disease, and candidiasis.

TI  == effect of s-prg eluate on biofilm formation and enzyme activity of oral bacteria.
AB  == recently, the antibacterial activity of a composite resin containing prereacted glass ionomer (s-prg) filler was revealed. we examined the effect of an s-prg eluate on various biologic activities of streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. adherence ability of s. mutans was evaluated by microtiter plate assay; protease and gelatinase activities of p. gingivalis were examined by synthetic substrate hydrolysis and gelatin film spot assay, respectively. coaggregation of p. gingivalis with fusobacterium nucleatum was also examined. s-prg eluate was found to suppress streptococcal adherence. s-prg eluate inhibited the protease and gelatinase activities of p. gingivalis and the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. these results indicate that s-prg eluate suppresses streptococcal adherence and inhibits the protease and coaggregation activities of p. gingivalis. these findings may prompt research into novel strategies for preventing caries and periodontitis.

TI  == peripheral arterial disease associated with caries and periodontal disease.
AB  == background: peripheral arterial disease (pad) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of pad and other cardiovascular conditions. recently, streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. the aim of this study is to evaluate the  possible clinical and microbiologic association between pad and periodontitis and dental caries. methods: thirty patients with pad and 30 control individuals were  selected. pad and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial  index (abi). clinical attachment loss (al); probing depth; decayed, missing, and  filled teeth (dmft) index; and c-reactive protein (crp) levels were evaluated. the presence of bacterial dna from streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. results: patients with >/=30% al >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having pad (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; p = 0.031). there was statistical difference in the crp (p = 0.0413) and dmft index (p = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (p = 0.0459) in the pad group compared with the control group. there were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. conclusion: there was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on al and pad determined by the abi (odds ratio = 8.18).

TI  == antimicrobial peptide control of pathogenic microorganisms of the oral cavity: a  review of the literature.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides, molecules produced in many different organisms, have high biocidal activity against several microorganisms. however, several questions about these molecules remain unclear. therefore, this report details a systematic survey of the literature on the use of antimicrobial peptides against oral pathogens and indicates which peptides and microorganisms are most extensively studied. articles were located using the pubmed and science direct databases with the following inclusion criteria: publication date between 2002 and 2011; keywords "biofilm or biological film or biological layer or bacterial growth" and "peptide" and "oral cavity or mouth or buccal mucosa or oral mucosa or mouth mucosa"; and abstract in english. a total of 73 articles were selected after refinement of the data. an increase in publications focusing on the use of antimicrobial peptides against oral microorganisms was observed. in addition, the peptides produced by cells of the oral mucosa (defensins, ll-37 and histatins) as well as streptococcus mutans (among cariogenic bacteria) and porphyromonas gingivalis (among periodontal bacteria) were the most studied subjects. it was concluded that the use of antimicrobial peptides as a tool for microbial control  is of increasing importance, likely due to its widespread use, mechanism of action, and low rates of bacterial resistance.

TI  == levels of selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: to compare the levels of selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique. between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the mann-whitney u-test. results: subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, s. sputigena and the mitsuokella sp. human oral taxon (hot) 131 (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone cs002), while higher mean counts of actinomyces gerencseriae and streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). selenomonas sp. hot 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of p. gingivalis and s. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive  periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. there were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of p. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), s. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and selenomonas dianae (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone ew076) (r  = 0.42, p < 0.05). conclusion: s. sputigena and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated  further.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == bactericidal activity and oral pathogen inactivation by electromagnetic wave irradiation.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to clarify the effects of electromagnetic wave irradiation (emwi) on oral bacterial pathogens. methods and results: a gram-negative (porphyromonas gingivalis) or gram-positive (streptococcus mutans,  s. intermedius, enterococcus faecalis) bacterial suspension was irradiated by emw apparatus (500-1000 khz, 5-15 times, 1 s time(-1) ). quantification of survival bacteria by cfu counting revealed that emwi exhibited marked bactericidal activity against all tested bacteria and bactericidal activity at 500 khz increased in an irradiation number-dependent manner. after emwi at 500 khz, scanning electron microscopic observations showed that the chain of s. mutans cells was shortened after 5 irradiations and the outlines of bacterial cells (s.  mutans and p. gingivalis) were unclear after 5-10 irradiations. emwi inhibited the inductive effect of s. mutans on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human monocytes and this inhibitory effect was comparable with that of heat-killed bacteria. furthermore, using an enzyme activity assay, emwi partially inactivated the activities of gingipains from p. gingivalis. conclusions: these findings demonstrated that emwi has inactivation and bactericidal activities against single microbial species among four kinds of oral pathogens. significance and impact of the study: electromagnetic wave irradiation may be applicable for medical disinfection and sterilization, such as refractory periapical periodontitis.

TI  == lysine substitutions convert a bacterial-agglutinating peptide into a bactericidal peptide that retains anti-lipopolysaccharide activity and low hemolytic activity.
AB  == gl13nh2 is a bacteria-agglutinating peptide derived from the sequence of the salivary protein parotid secretory protein (psp, bpifa2, splunc2, c20orf70). the  peptide agglutinates both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and shows anti-lipopolysaccharide activity in vitro and in vivo. however, gl13nh2 does not  exhibit bactericidal activity. to generate a more cationic peptide with potential bactericidal activity, three amino acid residues were replaced with lysine residues to generate the peptide gl13k. in this report, the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of gl13k were characterized. gl13k had lost the ability to agglutinate bacteria but gained bactericidal activity. substitution of individual amino acids in gl13k with alanine did not restore bacterial agglutination. gl13k was bactericidal against pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus gordonii and escherichia coli but not porphyromonas gingivalis. unlike the agglutinating activity of gl13nh2, the bactericidal activity of gl13k  against p. aeruginosa was retained in the presence of saliva. both gl13nh2 and gl13k exhibited anti-lipopolysaccharide activity. in gl13k, this activity appeared to depend on a serine hydroxyl group. gl13k protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis and the peptide exhibited a low level of hemolysis, suggesting that it may be suitable for in vivo application.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus arca interferes with porphyromonas gingivalis pathogenicity in mice.
AB  == background and objective: porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as one of  the major pathogens in chronic periodontitis, an infectious disease affecting the majority of the adult population. we have previously demonstrated that a surface  protein, arginine deiminase (arca), of streptococcus cristatus represses production of p. gingivalis long fimbriae and interrupts the formation of p. gingivalis biofilms in vitro. our in vivo studies have also shown that the distribution of p. gingivalis and s. cristatus in human subgingival plaque is negatively correlated. the objective of this study was to determine if s. cristatus arca inhibits p. gingivalis colonization and attenuates its subsequent  pathogenesis in alveolar bone loss in the murine oral cavity. material and methods: a wild-type strain of s. cristatus (cc5a) and its arca knockout mutant (arcae) were used as initial colonizers in the oral cavity of balb/cbyj mice. colonization of p. gingivalis on the existing s. cristatus biofilms was assessed  by quantitative pcr, and p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was measured 6  wk after p. gingivalis infection. results: the presence of s. cristatus cc5a, but not its arca mutant, attenuated p. gingivalis colonization in the murine oral cavity. in addition, p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was significantly lower in mice initially infected with s. cristatus cc5a than in those infected with the arca mutant. conclusion: this study provides direct evidence that s. cristatus arca has an inhibitory effect on p. gingivalis colonization, which may  in turn attenuate the pathogenicity of p. gingivalis.

TI  == antimicrobial and osteogenic effect of ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface.
AB  == ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface was prepared by hydrothermal  treatment with h(2)o(2) followed by ag plasma immersion ion implantation. streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis and candida albicans were chosen for antimicrobial tests. genes related to microbial structure or adhesion, namely glucan-binding proteins b (gbpb), fimbria protein a (fima), and agglutinin-like sequence4 (als4), were examined. the osteoblast's attachment, viability, and quantitative analysis of osteogenic gene expression (alp, ocn, runx2) on titanium surfaces were evaluated. scanning electron microscopy (sem) revealed that ag nanoparticles of approximately 10 nm were incorporated on the nanostructured surface of titanium after ag plasma immersion ion implantation. trials showed that 93.99% of s. mutans, 93.57% of p. g, and 89.78% of c. albicans were killed on the ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface. gene expressions from the three microorganisms confirmed the antimicrobial activities of the ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface. furthermore, the adhesive images and viability assays indicated that the ag-implanted titanium with a nanostructured surface did not impair osteoblasts. the expressions of osteoblast  phenotype genes in cells grown on the ag-implanted titanium surface were significantly increased. the results of this study suggest that the ag-implanted  titanium with a nanostructured surface displays good antimicrobial properties, reducing gene expressions of microorganisms, and excellent cell adhesion and osteogenic effects.

TI  == tyrosine phosphorylation and bacterial virulence.
AB  == protein phosphorylation on tyrosine has emerged as a key device in the control of numerous cellular functions in bacteria. in this article, we review the structure and function of bacterial tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. phosphorylation is catalyzed by autophosphorylating adenosine triphosphate-dependent enzymes (bacterial tyrosine (by) kinases) that are characterized by the presence of walker motifs. the reverse reaction is catalyzed by three classes of enzymes: the eukaryotic-like phosphatases (ptps) and dual-specific phosphatases; the low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatases (lmw-ptps); and the polymerase-histidinol phosphatases (php). many by kinases and tyrosine phosphatases can utilize host cell proteins as substrates, thereby contributing to bacterial pathogenicity. bacterial tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation  is also involved in biofilm formation and community development. the porphyromonas gingivalis tyrosine phosphatase ltp1 is involved in a restraint pathway that regulates heterotypic community development with streptococcus gordonii. ltp1 is upregulated by contact with s. gordonii and ltp1 activity controls adhesin expression and levels of the interspecies signal ai-2.

AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == role of gallium and silver from phosphate-based glasses on in vitro dual species  oral biofilm models of porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == phosphate-based glasses (pbgs) are excellent controlled delivery agents for antibacterial ions such as silver and gallium. the aim of this study was to assess the potential utility of novel pbgs combining both gallium and silver for  use in periodontal therapy. to this end, an in vitro biofilm model with the putative periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis, and an initial colonizer, streptococcus gordonii, was established. the effect of increasing calcium content in gallium-silver-doped pbg on the susceptibility of p. gingivalis was examined. a decrease in degradation rates (30.34, 25.19, 21.40 mug mm(-2) h(-1)) with increasing pbg calciumcontent (10, 11, 12 mol.% respectively)  was observed, correlating well with gallium and silver ion release and antimicrobial activity against planktonic p. gingivalis (approximately 5.4log(10) colony-forming units (cfu) reduction after 24h by the c10 glass compared with controls) and s. gordonii (total growth inhibition after 32h by c10, c11 and c12  glasses compared with controls). the most potent pbg (c10) was evaluated for its  ability to inhibit the biofilm growth of p. gingivalis in a newly established constant-depth film fermentor model. the simultaneous release of silver and gallium from the glass reduced p. gingivalis biofilm growth with a maximum effect (1.92log(10) cfu reduction) after 168 h. given the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and dearth of new antibiotics in development, the glasses, especially c10, would offer effective alternatives to antibiotics or may complement current therapies through controlled, localized delivery of gallium and silver ions at infected sites in the oral cavity.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of honey in vitro and antiplaque efficacy in a 4-day plaque regrowth model in vivo: preliminary results.
AB  == background: honey has a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial action that may make  it suitable for "anti-infective" treatment of periodontal disease. the aims of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of honey against oral bacteria and compare the same with 0.2% chlorhexidine; and 2) to compare antiplaque efficacy in vivo with chlorhexidine. methods: the study was conducted in two parts. in the in vitro part, the inhibitory effects of three test agents, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, honey mouthwash, and saline, against six oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512  mug/ml were tested in duplicate. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was set as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. the in vivo part consisted of a double-masked parallel clinical trial based on a 4-day plaque regrowth model. sixty-six volunteers, 20 to 24 years of age, participated in the study, and the plaque scores were compared at baseline and at the end of 4 days. the kruskal-wallis test was used for significance, and the mann-whitney u test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups. the mean plaque scores were 1.77 +/- 0.86, 1.64 +/- 0.90, and 3.27 +/- 0.83 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. results: the honey mouthrinse effectively inhibited the six tested microorganisms. the chlorhexidine gluconate  rinse had the lowest mics compared with honey and saline rinses for all test species examined. the in vivo results revealed that plaque formation was inhibited/reduced by chlorhexidine and honey rinses. conclusion: honey has antibacterial action against tested oral microorganisms and also has antiplaque action.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

TI  == bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  == pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined  against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species. a subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. for 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin mbc was within two doubling dilutions of the mic. for the remaining strains, the mic and mbc were within three to four doubling dilutions. pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the mbc was equal to the mic for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. as pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal  effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/ml. the bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as  low as 0.125 mug/ml. in conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of mbc and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. it is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. these data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of galls of quercus infectoria olivier against oral pathogens.
AB  == the galls of quercus infectoria are commonly used in malay traditional medicine to treat wound infections after childbirth. in india, they are employed traditionally as dental applications such as that in treatment of toothache and gingivitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of galls of quercus infectoria olivier against oral bacteria which are known to cause dental caries and periodontitis. methanol and acetone extracts were screened against two gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419) and two gram-negative bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586). the screening test of antibacterial activity was performed using agar-well diffusion  method. subsequently, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by using twofold serial microdilution method at a concentration ranging between 0.01 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml. minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was obtained by subculturing microtiter wells which showed no changes in colour of the indicator  after incubation. both extracts showed inhibition zones which did not differ significantly (p < 0.05) against each tested bacteria. among all tested bacteria, s. salivarius was the most susceptible. the mic ranges for methanol and acetone extracts were the same, between 0.16 and 0.63 mg/ml. the mbc value, for methanol  and acetone extracts, was in the ranges 0.31-1.25 mg/ml and 0.31-2.50 mg/ml, respectively. both extracts of q. infectoria galls exhibited similar antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. thus, the galls may be considered  as effective phytotherapeutic agents for the prevention of oral pathogens.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == in situ gastrointestinal protection against anthrax edema toxin by single-chain antibody fragment producing lactobacilli.
AB  == background: anthrax is caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis and is regarded as one of the most prominent bioterrorism threats. anthrax toxicity is induced by the tripartite toxin complex, composed of the receptor-binding anthrax protective antigen and the two enzymatic subunits, lethal factor and edema factor. recombinant lactobacilli have previously been used to deliver antibody fragments  directed against surface epitopes of a variety of pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and rotavirus. here, we addressed whether or not anthrax toxins could be targeted and neutralised in the gastrointestinal tract by lactobacilli producing recombinant antibody fragments as a model system for toxin neutralisation in the gastrointestinal lumen. results: the neutralising anti-pa scfv, 1h, was expressed in l. paracasei as a secreted protein, a cell wall-anchored protein or both secreted and wall-anchored protein. cell wall display on lactobacilli and pa binding of the anchored constructs was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. binding of secreted or attached scfv produced by lactobacilli to pa were verified by elisa. both construct were able to protect macrophages in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. finally, lactobacilli producing the cell wall attached scfv were able to neutralise the activity of anthrax edema toxin in the gi tract of mice, in vivo.  conclusion: we have developed lactobacilli expressing a neutralising scfv fragment against the pa antigen of the anthrax toxin, which can provide protection against anthrax toxins both in vitro and in vivo. utilising engineered lactobacilli therapeutically for neutralising toxins in the gastrointestinal tract can potential be expanded to provide protection against a range of additional gastrointestinal pathogens. the ability of lactobacilli to colonise the gastrointestinal tract may allow the system to be used both prophylactically  and therapeutically.

TI  == oral bacterial dna differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  == background: deoxyribonucleic acids (dna) of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human  monocytic cells (thp-1) through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and nuclear factor-kappab signaling. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. we investigate inflammatory mediator production in thp-1 cells challenged with fn and streptococcus sanguinis (ss) dna, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or pg lipopolysaccharide (lps) are affected by tlr-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). methods: thp-1 cells were stimulated with pg-dna (100 ng/mul), fn-dna (100 ng/mul), ss-dna (100 ng/mul), pg-lps (10 ng/mul), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/ml). interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using dunnett or tukey methods and paired t test. a value of p <0.05 was significant. results: inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of ss-dna (p <0.05). chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from thp-1 cells with the exception of il-6 production triggered by whole fn and ss (p <0.05). conclusions: differences exist among oral bacterial dna in inducing immune responses. by altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might  be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.

TI  == the adhesion of oral bacteria to modified titanium surfaces: role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces.
AB  == objectives: modifications of titanium (ti) implant surfaces have a significant effect on early biofilm formation and the outcome of implant procedures. the aim  of this study was to examine the role of plasma proteins and electrostatic forces in the adhesion mechanism of oral bacteria to modified ti surfaces. materials and methods: ti discs with three different types of surface modifications, machined,  acid-etched, and acid-etched and blasted, were examined for adhesion of oral bacteria: streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. following pretreatment of the ti with ion rich solutions or coating by human serum albumin or fibronectin, bacterial adhesion was examined by scanning electron microscopy and assessed quantitatively by dna analysis. ti coating by proteins as well as bacterial adhesion and their interrelationships were further  investigated through confocal scanning laser microscopy. results: acid-etched and blasted ti surfaces exhibited significantly higher amounts of bacteria adhesion than the other two surfaces. calcium was found to serve as a bridging agent in the adhesion process of s. mutans and f. nucleatum to ti surfaces. although albumin coating of the ti reduced the adhesion of s. mutans to all surfaces, it had no influence on the adhesion of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. coating the ti with fibronectin enhanced p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum adhesion. conclusions: bacterial adhesion to ti surfaces is roughness-dependent, and the adhesion mechanism is influenced by ions and proteins of the initial coating derived from  the blood.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was  unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced  virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex  members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum,  parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however,  when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity  of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

AB  == objectives: to explore the short-term effects from toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine. background: numerous reports have been seen in recent years proving the effectiveness of mouth cleaning with a toothbrush for the prevention of respiratory infections among the dependent elderly. however, the short-term effects from each oral care method have not yet been clarified. hence, an investigation was conducted by having each subject independently perform various  oral care methods for five consecutive days. materials and methods: the subjects  consisted of 12 assistance-dependent elderly who have difficulties with tooth brushing by themselves, have 10 or more residual teeth and are not yet using plate dentures. after the pre-intervention examination, each of the following oral care methods were performed on the same subject on an approximately three week basis: 1) tooth brushing 2) tongue cleaning with sponge brush 3) wiping on oral mucous with sponge brush by chlorhexidine. each method was performed independently, once a day for 5 consecutive days and the subjects were reexamined on the sixth day for comparative verification. results: consequently, toothbrushing decreased the plaque index and gingival index significantly and an  improvement of oral malodour was also acknowledged (p < 0.01). tongue cleaning with a sponge brush decreased the tongue coat score significantly (p < 0.05) and  oral malodour was also improved (p < 0.01). wiping on oral mucous with a sponge brush soaked in chlorhexidine significantly decreased opportunistic infections in the pharynx region (p < 0.05). conclusions: it was suggested that the use of not  only a toothbrush but also chlorhexidine gluconate may be indicated for dependent elderly people in whom pathogens of opportunistic infection are detected.

TI  == tobacco smoke augments porphyromonas gingivalis-streptococcus gordonii biofilm formation.
AB  == smoking is responsible for the majority of periodontitis cases in the us and smokers are more susceptible than non-smokers to infection by the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. p. gingivalis colonization of the oral cavity  is dependent upon its interaction with other plaque bacteria, including streptococcus gordonii. microarray analysis suggested that exposure of p. gingivalis to cigarette smoke extract (cse) increased the expression of the major fimbrial antigen (fima), but not the minor fimbrial antigen (mfa1). therefore, we hypothesized that cse promotes p. gingivalis-s. gordonii biofilm formation in a fima-dependent manner. fima total protein and cell surface expression were increased upon exposure to cse whereas mfa1 was unaffected. cse exposure did not  induce p. gingivalis auto-aggregation but did promote dual species biofilm formation, monitored by microcolony numbers and depth (both, p<0.05). interestingly, p. gingivalis biofilms grown in the presence of cse exhibited a lower pro-inflammatory capacity (tnf-alpha, il-6) than control biofilms (both, p<0.01). cse-exposed p. gingivalis bound more strongly to immobilized rgapdh, the cognate fima ligand on s. gordonii, than control biofilms (p<0.001) and did so in a dose-dependent manner. nevertheless, a peptide representing the mfa1 binding site on s. gordonii, sspb, completely inhibited dual species biofilm formation. thus, cse likely augments p. gingivalis biofilm formation by increasing fima avidity which, in turn, supports initial interspecies interactions and promotes subsequent high affinity mfa1-sspb interactions driving biofilm growth. cse induction of p. gingivalis biofilms of limited pro-inflammatory potential may explain the increased persistence of this pathogen in smokers. these findings may also be relevant to other biofilm-induced infectious diseases and conditions.

AB  == phytochemical investigation of a supercritical fluid extract of glycyrrhiza uralensis has led to the isolation of 20 known isoflavonoids and coumarins, and glycycarpan (7), a new pterocarpan. the presence of two isoflavan-quinones, licoriquinone a (8) and licoriquinone b (9), in a fraction subjected to gel filtration on sephadex lh-20 is due to suspected metal-catalyzed oxidative degradation of licoricidin (1) and licorisoflavan a (2). the major compounds in the extract, as well as 8, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of several major oral pathogens. compounds 1 and 2 showed the most potent antibacterial activities, causing a marked growth inhibition of the cariogenic species streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus at 10 mug/ml and the periodontopathogenic species porphyromonas gingivalis (at 5 mug/ml) and prevotella intermedia (at 5 mug/ml for 1 and 2.5 mug/ml for 2). only 1 moderately inhibited growth of fusobacterium nucleatum at the highest concentration tested (10 mug/ml).

TI  == differential expression and adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotypes.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a primary pathogen involved in the initiation and progression of adult chronic periodontitis. its colonization on oral surfaces is  a necessary first step leading to infection. fima, a subunit protein of major (long) fimbriae, is a well-known virulence factor. based on its nucleotide sequence, fima is classified into several genotypes. we compared here the transcriptional levels of the fima gene in several p. gingivalis strains using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, fimbrial display on the p. gingivalis surface using transmission electronic microscopy, and the adherence competencies of p. gingivalis strains carrying different types of fimas towards saliva and streptococcus gordonii surfaces using mutagenesis analysis. we demonstrated differential expression of each fima gene in these p. gingivalis strains. a correlation of the transcription level of fima and binding activity of p. gingivalis was revealed. we show that p. gingivalis strains with genotype i and ii of fima are efficient in interaction with saliva or s. gordonii. this work highlights the important role of fima type i and ii in p. gingivalis attachment to oral surfaces.

TI  == oral biofilm analysis of palatal expanders by fluorescence in-situ hybridization  and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
AB  == confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) of natural heterogeneous biofilm is today facilitated by a comprehensive range of staining techniques, one of them being fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). we performed a pilot study in which oral biofilm samples collected from fixed orthodontic appliances (palatal expanders) were stained by fish, the objective being to assess the three-dimensional organization of natural biofilm and plaque accumulation. fish creates an opportunity to stain cells in their native biofilm environment by the  use of fluorescently labeled 16s rrna-targeting probes. compared to alternative techniques like immunofluorescent labeling, this is an inexpensive, precise and straightforward labeling technique to investigate different bacterial groups in mixed biofilm consortia. general probes were used that bind to eubacteria (eub338 + eub338ii + eub338iii; hereafter eubmix), firmicutes (lgc354 a-c; hereafter lgcmix), and bacteroidetes (bac303). in addition, specific probes binding to streptococcus mutans (mut590) and porphyromonas gingivalis (pogi) were used. the  extreme hardness of the surface materials involved (stainless steel and acrylic resin) compelled us to find new ways of preparing the biofilm. as these surface materials could not be readily cut with a cryotome, various sampling methods were explored to obtain intact oral biofilm. the most workable of these approaches is  presented in this communication. small flakes of the biofilm-carrying acrylic resin were scraped off with a sterile scalpel, taking care not to damage the biofilm structure. forceps were used to collect biofilm from the steel surfaces.  once collected, the samples were fixed and placed directly on polysine coated glass slides. fish was performed directly on these slides with the probes mentioned above. various fish protocols were combined and modified to create a new protocol that was easy to handle. subsequently the samples were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. well-known configurations could be visualized, including mushroom-style formations and clusters of coccoid bacteria  pervaded by channels. in addition, the bacterial composition of these typical biofilm structures were analyzed and 2d and 3d images created.

AB  == objectives: this study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial effects of an o-cymen-5-ol/zinc system. methods: o-cymen-5-ol and zinc gluconate minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were  determined against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and candida albicans. synergy was investigated by checkerboard mic/mbc; inhibition of p. gingivalis protease activity and s. mutans glycolysis were investigated. slurried toothpastes containing the system were assessed in kill time assays against s. mutans and e.  coli. results: o-cymen-5-ol mic was between 1.7 mm to 3.4 mm; mbc was 3.4 mm to 6.7 mm. zinc gluconate mic was 2.8 mm to 11 mm; mbc was between 11 mm and >44 mm. the two agents in solution showed synergy (fici</=0.50) against p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, with mic of 0.42 mm/0.69 mm for o-cymen-5-ol/zinc gluconate, respectively. zinc inhibited glycolysis and protease to a greater degree than o-cymen-5-ol; glycolysis inhibition by the two agents was additive. o-cymen-5-ol/zinc chloride in toothpaste showed greater effects than placebo (120s log10 kill=7.35+/-0.40 and 4.02+/-0.40, respectively). conclusions: the zinc/o-cymen-5-ol system has direct antimicrobial effects and inhibits oral disease-related processes. synergistic effects were seen against anaerobes. a system combining o-cymen-5-ol and zinc shows properties desirable for incorporation in toothpastes.

TI  == identification of interspecies interactions affecting porphyromonas gingivalis virulence phenotypes.
AB  == background: periodontitis is recognized as a complex polymicrobial disease, however, the impact of the bacterial interactions among the 700-1,000 different species of the oral microbiota remains poorly understood. we conducted an in vitro screen for oral bacteria that mitigate selected virulence phenotypes of the important periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. method: we isolated and identified oral anaerobic bacteria from subgingival plaque of dental patients. when cocultured with p. gingivalis w83, specific isolates reduced the cytopathogenic effects of p. gingivalis on oral epithelial cells. result: in an initial screen of 103 subgingival isolates, we identified 19 distinct strains from nine species of bacteria (including actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and veilonella dispar) that protect oral epithelial  cells from p. gingivalis-induced cytotoxicity. we found that some of these strains inhibited p. gingivalis growth in plate assays through the production of  organic acids, whereas some decreased the gingipain activity of p. gingivalis in  coculture or mixing experiments. conclusion: in summary, we identified 19 strains isolated from human subgingival plaque that interacted with p. gingivalis, resulting in mitigation of its cytotoxicity to oral epithelial cells, inhibition  of growth, and/or reduction of gingipain activity. understanding the mechanisms of interaction between bacteria in the oral microbial community may lead to the development of new probiotic agents and new strategies for interrupting the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == presence of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == periodontal disease has been recently linked to a variety of systemic conditions  such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, preterm delivery, and oral cancer. the  most common bacteria associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) has not yet been studied in the malignant gingival tissues. the objective of this study was to investigate the presence of p. gingivalis in specimens from squamous cell carcinoma patients. we have performed  immunohistochemical staining to investigate the presence of p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii (s. gordonii), a non invasive oral bacteria, in paraffin embedded samples of gingival squamous cell carcinoma (n = 10) and normal gingiva  (n = 5). staining for p. gingivalis revealed the presence of the bacteria in normal gingival tissues and gingival carcinoma, with higher levels (more than 33%, p < 0.05) detected in the carcinoma samples. the staining intensity was also significantly enhanced in the malignant tissue by 2 folds (p < 0.023) compared to specimens stained for the non-invasive s. gordonii. p. gingivalis is abundantly present in malignant oral epithelium suggesting a potential association of the bacteria with gingival squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  == isolation and extraction of antimicrobial substances against oral bacteria from lemon peel.
AB  == we have isolated 4 antibacterial substances that were active against the oral bacteria that cause dental caries and periodontitis, such as streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis, from lemon peel, a waste product in the citrus industry. the isolated substances were identified as  8-geranyloxypsolaren, 5-geranyloxypsolaren, 5-geranyloxy-7-methoxycoumarin, and phloroglucinol 1-beta-d-glucopyranoside (phlorin) upon structural analyses. among these, 8-geranyloxypsolaren, 5-geranyloxypsolaren, and 5-geranyloxy-7-methoxycoumarin exhibited high antibacterial activity. these 3 compounds were effectively extracted using ethanol and n-hexane, whereas phlorin  was extracted with water. further, the above 3 compounds were present in lemon essential oil and abundantly present in the residue produced upon the cooling treatment of concentrated lemon essential oil.

TI  == comparative evaluation of two structurally related flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin  and liquiritigenin, for their oral infection therapeutic potential.
AB  == isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. the purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. in  contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans  and streptococcus sobrinus). furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward p. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (lps) was much higher when compared to 2. the activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) associated with the lps-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.

TI  == electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium grade 2 and ti6al4v alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == influence of gaseous ozone in peri-implantitis: bactericidal efficacy and cellular response. an in vitro study using titanium and zirconia.
AB  == dental implants are prone to bacterial colonization which may result in bone destruction and implant loss. treatments of peri-implant disease aim to reduce bacterial adherence while leaving the implant surface intact for attachment of bone-regenerating host cells. the aims of this study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of gaseous ozone on bacteria adhered to various titanium and zirconia surfaces and to evaluate adhesion of osteoblast-like mg-63 cells to  ozone-treated surfaces. saliva-coated titanium (sla and polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) disks served as substrates for the adherence of streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277. the test specimens were treated with gaseous ozone (140 ppm; 33 ml/s) for 6 and 24 s. bacteria were resuspended using ultrasonication, serially diluted and cultured. mg-63 cell adhesion was analyzed with reference to cell attachment, morphology, spreading, and proliferation. surface topography as well as cell morphology of the test specimens were inspected by sem. the highest bacterial adherence was found on titanium sla whereas the other surfaces revealed 50-75% less adherent bacteria. p. gingivalis was eliminated by ozone from all surfaces within 24 s to  below the detection limit (>/=99.94% reduction). s. sanguinis was more resistant  and showed the highest reduction on zirconia substrates (>90% reduction). ozone treatment did not affect the surface structures of the test specimens and did not influence osteoblastic cell adhesion and proliferation negatively. titanium (polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) had a lower colonization potential and may be suitable material for implant abutments. gaseous ozone showed selective efficacy to reduce adherent bacteria on titanium and zirconia without affecting adhesion and proliferation of osteoblastic cells. this in vitro study may provide a solid basis for clinical studies on gaseous ozone treatment of peri-implantitis and revealed an essential base for sufficient tissue regeneration.

TI  == chlorhexidine varnishes effectively inhibit porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans - an in vivo study.
AB  == background: chlorhexidine varnish (cervitec- ivoclar vivadent- liechtenstein) is  a sustained-release delivery system that can provide protection against white spots and gingivitis, which are common iatrogenic side effects of orthodontic treatment. chlorhexidine in varnish form does not depend on patient compliance, does not stain teeth or alter taste sensation like the mouth rinse. materials and methods: a split-mouth technique was followed in the treatment of 30 patients selected by stringent selection criteria, evaluating a single application of the  test varnish on two randomly allotted quadrants along with a placebo on the other two quadrants. streptococcus mutans counts responsible for white spots and p. gingivalis count [using pcr test] responsible for gingivitis were done at the start of the study, and then 1 and 3 months later. results: the chlorhexidine varnish reduced the streptococci mutans count at the end of 1 month, and this reduction was statistically significant. at the end of 3 months, there was no difference in the s. mutans counts between the two groups. there was a statistically significant reduction in the p. gingivalis count at the end of both 1 and 3 months in comparison to the placebo group. conclusion: chlorhexidine varnishes are capable of reducing s. mutans and p. gingivalis and gingivitis, thus improving the overall oral health of the patient. the side effects of chlorhexidine mouth rinses are not seen with this varnish. an application schedule of at least once a month is recommended as the effectiveness is reduced  comparatively at the end of 3 months.

TI  == b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors of oral squamous carcinoma cells are upregulated by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the up-regulation of the b7-h1 receptors in host cells might influence the chronicity of inflammatory disorders that frequently precede the development of human cancers. b7-h1 expression has been detected in the majority of human cancers, leading to anergy and apoptosis of activated t cells, and enabling tumor cells to overcome host response. porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), a putative periodontal pathogen, is an etiologic agent of periodontitis and expresses a variety of virulence factors. in this study, the expression of b7-h1  and b7-dc receptors on squamous cell carcinoma cells scc-25 and bhy and primary human gingival keratinocytes (phgk) was analyzed after infection with two virulent p. gingivalis strains in vitro. after 48h, the cells were stained with antibodies for human b7-h1 and b7-dc and further analyzed by flow cytometry. rna  was extracted and gene expression of b7-h1 or b7-dc was quantified by real time pcr. after infection with p. gingivalis, both b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors were up-regulated. the mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) increased from 4.5 to 9.9 (b7-h1) and from 6.9 to 15.0 (b7-dc) (p<0.05, respectively) in scc-25 cells. phgk showed an increase from 4.8 to 12.4 (b7-h1) and from 5.5 to 15.6 (b7-dc) (p<0.05, respectively). streptococcus salivarius k12, a commensal bacterium, caused no up-regulation. after 24h, the expression of b7h1 and b7-dc mrna in infected cells, normalized to gapdh and in relation to non-infected cells, was 6.4 fold (b7-h1) and 8.6 fold (b7-dc) higher. in phgk b7-h1/dc mrna expression increased 8.2 fold (b7-h1) and 5.9 fold (b7dc) (p<0.05) respectively. the results of the study demonstrate that in contrast to s. salivarius k12 virulent p. gingivalis strains are able to induce the expression of the b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors in squamous carcinoma cells and human gingival keratinocytes, which might facilitate immune evasion by oral cancers.

TI  == the pathogenic persona of community-associated oral streptococci.
AB  == the mitis group streptococci (mgs) are widespread in the oral cavity and are traditionally associated with oral health. however, these organisms have many attributes that contribute to the development of pathogenic oral communities. mgs adhere rapidly to saliva-coated tooth surfaces, thereby providing an attachment substratum for more overtly pathogenic organisms such as porphyromonas gingivalis, and the two species assemble into heterotypic communities. close physical association facilitates physiologic support, and pathogens such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans display resource partitioning to favour carbon sources generated by streptococcal metabolism. mgs exchange information with community members through a number of interspecies signalling systems including ai-2 and contact dependent mechanisms. signal transduction systems induced in p. gingivalis are based on protein dephosphorylation mediated by the tyrosine phosphatase ltp1, and converge on a luxr-family transcriptional regulator, cdhr. phenotypic responses in p. gingivalis include regulation of hemin uptake systems and gingipain activity, processes that are intimately linked to the virulence of the organism. furthermore, communities of s. gordonii with p. gingivalis or with a. actinomycetemcomitans are more pathogenic in animal models  than the constituent species alone. we propose that mgs should be considered accessory pathogens, organisms whose pathogenic potential only becomes evident in the context of a heterotypic microbial community.

AB  == scaffolds used in the field of tissue engineering should facilitate the adherence, spreading, and ingrowth of cells as well as prevent microbial adherence. for the first time, this study simultaneously deals with microbial and tissue cell adhesion to rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds. the cell growth  of human osteosarcoma cells (cal-72) over a time period of 3-11 days were examined on three scaffolds (plga, plla, plla-tcp) and compared to the adhesion of salivary microorganisms and representative germs of the oral flora (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, enterococcus  faecalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis). scanning electron microscopy (sem), cell proliferation measurements, and determination of the colony forming units (cfu) were performed. the cell proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp after 3, 7, and 11 days of cultivation were higher than on plga. on  day 3 the proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp, and on day 5 on plla-tcp, proved to be significantly higher compared to that of the control (culture plate). the strain which showed the most cfus on all of the investigated scaffolds was p. gingivalis, followed by e. faecalis. no significant cfu differences were determined examining p. gingivalis among the biomaterials. in contrast, e. faecalis was significantly more adherent to plga and plla compared to plla-tcp. the lowest cfu values were seen with c. albicans and p. nigrescens.  salivary born aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms adhered significantly more to  plga compared to plla-tcp. these results supported by sem point out the high potential of plla-tcp in the field of tissue engineering.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == interaction of oral bacteria with gingival epithelial cell multilayers.
AB  == primary gingival epithelial cells were cultured in multilayers as a model for the study of interactions with oral bacteria associated with health and periodontal disease. multilayers maintained at an air-liquid interface in low-calcium medium  displayed differentiation and cytokeratin properties characteristic of junctional epithelium. multilayers were infected with fluorescently labeled porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum or streptococcus gordonii, and bacterial association was determined by confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. porphyromonas gingivalis invaded intracellularly and spread from cell to cell; a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum remained extracellular and showed intercellular movement through the multilayer; whereas s. gordonii remained extracellular and predominantly associated with the superficial cell layer. none of the bacterial species disrupted barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance.  p. gingivalis did not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. however, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and s. gordonii induced interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-6 and il-8 secretion; and f. nucleatum stimulated production of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, but not p. gingivalis, increased levels of apoptosis after 24 h infection. the results indicate that the organisms with pathogenic potential were able to traverse the epithelium, whereas the commensal bacteria did not. in addition, distinct host responses characterized the interaction between the junctional epithelium and oral bacteria.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == molecular analysis of microbial communities in endotracheal tube biofilms.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most prevalent acquired infection of patients on intensive care units and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. evidence suggests that an improved understanding of the  composition of the biofilm communities that form on endotracheal tubes may result in the development of improved preventative strategies for ventilator-associated  pneumonia. methodology/principal findings: the aim of this study was to characterise microbial biofilms on the inner luminal surface of extubated endotracheal tubes from icu patients using pcr and molecular profiling. twenty-four endotracheal tubes were obtained from twenty mechanically ventilated  patients. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) profiling of 16s rrna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population, together with species specific pcr of key marker oral microorganisms and a quantitative assessment of culturable aerobic bacteria. analysis of culturable aerobic bacteria revealed a range of colonisation from no growth to 2.1x10(8) colony forming units (cfu)/cm(2) of endotracheal tube (mean 1.4x10(7) cfu/cm(2)). pcr targeting of specific bacterial species detected the oral bacteria streptococcus mutans (n = 5) and porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 5). dgge profiling of the endotracheal biofilms revealed complex banding patterns containing between 3 and 22 (mean 6) bands per tube, thus demonstrating the marked complexity of the constituent biofilms. significant inter-patient diversity was evident. the number of dgge bands detected was not related to total viable microbial counts or the duration of intubation. conclusions/significance: molecular profiling using dgge  demonstrated considerable biofilm compositional complexity and inter-patient diversity and provides a rapid method for the further study of biofilm composition in longitudinal and interventional studies. the presence of oral microorganisms in endotracheal tube biofilms suggests that these may be important in biofilm development and may provide a therapeutic target for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  == novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  == oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. to provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host  cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (rgpls), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. bacterial species belonging  to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or  three-species biofilms, with each group comprising streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis; s. gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum; or s. gordonii, f. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative pcr (qpcr) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in  single-species and multispecies biofilms. we evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and hoechst 33258 and novel syto red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy  (clsm). substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. the specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == prunus mume extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: prunus mume is a common fruit in asia, which has been used in traditional chinese medicine. in this study, we focused on the antimicrobial properties of prunus mume extract against oral pathogens related to dental caries and periodontal diseases. study design: a total of 15 oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus acidophilus, p. gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and candida species were included in the study. initially, agar diffusion assay was performed to screen the antimicrobial activities of prunus mume extract. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were then determined for sensitive species. effect of prunus mume extract on human oral keratinocytes (hok) viability was also tested. result: in the agar diffusion assay, drug suspension of 2 g/ml was able to inhibit all the bacterial species tested, but not the fungal species. mic and mbc range of prunus mume extract against the oral bacteria was 0.15625-0.0003 g/ml and p. gingivalis being the most susceptible species. prune extract did not cause any detrimental effect on hok. conclusion: prunus mume extract may be a potential candidate for developing  an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with oral pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and  specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were  the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total  nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == community signalling between streptococcus gordonii and porphyromonas gingivalis  is controlled by the transcriptional regulator cdhr.
AB  == interspecies signalling between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii serves to constrain development of dual species communities. contact with s. gordonii propagates a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signal within p. gingivalis that culminates in reduced transcription of adhesin and signalling genes. here we demonstrate the involvement of the p. gingivalis orphan luxr family transcription factor pgn_1373, which we designate cdhr, in this control pathway. expression of cdhr is elevated following contact with s. gordonii; however, regulation of cdhr did not occur in a mutant lacking the tyrosine phosphatase ltp1, indicating that cdhr and ltp1 are components of the same regulon. contact between s. gordonii and a cdhr mutant resulted in increased transcription of mfa, encoding the subunit of the short fimbriae, along with higher levels of mfa protein. expression of luxs, encoding ai-2 synthase, was also increased in the cdhr mutant after contact with s. gordonii. the mfa adhesive function and ai-2-dependent signalling participate in the formation and  development of dual species communities, and consistent with this the cdhr mutant displayed elevated accumulation on a substratum of s. gordonii. recombinant cdhr  protein bound to upstream regulatory regions of both mfa and luxs, indicating that cdhr has a direct effect on gene expression. luxs was also found to participate in a positive feedback loop that suppresses cdhr expression. interaction of mfa fimbriae with s. gordonii is necessary to initiate signalling  through cdhr. these results reveal cdhr to be an effector molecule in a negative  regulatory network that controls p. gingivalis-s. gordonii heterotypic communities.

TI  == periodontal pathogens interfere with quorum-sensing-dependent virulence properties in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background and objective: the mechanism by which periodontal pathogens dominate at disease sites is not yet understood. one possibility is that these late colonizers antagonize the quorum-sensing systems of early colonizers and render those early colonizers less resistant to environmental factors. in this study, we utilized streptococcus mutans, a well-documented oral streptococcus with many quorum-sensing-dependent properties, as an example of an earlier colonizer antagonized by periodontal pathogens. material and methods: in this study, s. mutans ng8 and s. mutans lt11 were used in experiments assessing transformation,  and s. mutans bm71 was used in experiments investigating bacteriocin production.  the effects of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola on these competence-stimulating peptide-dependent properties were evaluated in mixed-broth assays. results: both p. gingivalis (either live bacteria or membrane vesicles) and t. denticola antagonized transformation in s.  mutans ng8 and lt11. the production of bacteriocin by s. mutans bm71 was also inhibited by p. gingivalis and t. denticola. boiling of these late colonizers before addition to the broth cultures abolished their ability to inhibit s. mutans transformation and bacteriocin production. p. gingivalis and t. denticola  inactivated s. mutans exogenous competence-stimulating peptide, whereas the boiled bacteria did not. conclusions: this study demonstrated that periodontal pathogens antagonize s. mutans quorum-sensing properties. this may render s. mutans less virulent and less resistant to environmental antibacterial factors.

TI  == structural dissection and in vivo effectiveness of a peptide inhibitor of porphyromonas gingivalis adherence to streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == the interaction of the minor fimbrial antigen (mfa) with streptococcal antigen i/ii (e.g., sspb) facilitates colonization of the dental biofilm by porphyromonas gingivalis. we previously showed that a 27-mer peptide derived from sspb (designated bar) resembles the nuclear receptor (nr) box protein-protein interacting domain and potently inhibits this interaction in vitro. here, we show that the exxp motif upstream of the nr core alpha-helix contributes to the mfa-sspb interaction and that bar reduces p. gingivalis colonization and alveolar bone loss in vivo in a murine model of periodontitis. substitution of gln for pro(1171) or glu(1168) increased the alpha-helicity of bar and reduced its inhibitory activity in vitro by 10-fold and 2-fold, respectively. to determine if bar prevents p. gingivalis infection in vivo, mice were first infected with streptococcus gordonii and then challenged with p. gingivalis in the absence and  presence of bar. animals that were infected with either 10(9) cfu of s. gordonii  dl-1 or 10(7) cfu of p. gingivalis 33277 did not show a statistically significant increase in alveolar bone resorption over sham-infected controls. however, infection with 10(9) cfu of s. gordonii followed by 10(7) cfu of p. gingivalis induced significantly greater bone loss (p < 0.01) than sham infection or infection of mice with either organism alone. s. gordonii-infected mice that were subsequently challenged with 10(7) cfu of p. gingivalis in the presence of bar exhibited levels of bone resorption similar to those of sham-infected animals. together, these results indicate that both exxp and the nr box are important for  the mfa-sspb interaction and that bar peptide represents a potential therapeutic  that may limit colonization of the oral cavity by p. gingivalis.

TI  == cdkn2bas is associated with periodontitis in different european populations and is activated by bacterial infection.
AB  == epidemiological studies have indicated a relationship between coronary heart disease (chd) and periodontitis. recently, cdkn2bas was reported as a shared genetic risk factor of chd and aggressive periodontitis (agp), but the causative  variant has remained unknown. to identify and validate risk variants in different european populations, we first explored 150 kb of the genetic region of cdkn2bas  including the adjacent genes cdkn2a and cdkn2b, covering 51 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagsnps) in agp and chronic periodontitis (cp) in individuals of dutch origin (n=313). in a second step, we tested the significant  snp associations in an independent agp and cp population of german origin (n=1264). for the tagsnps rs1360590, rs3217992, and rs518394, we could validate the associations with agp before and after adjustment for the covariates smoking, gender and diabetes, with snp rs3217992 being the most significant (or 1.48, 95%  ci 1.19 to 1.85; p=0.0004). we further showed in vivo gene expression of cdkn2bas, cdkn2a, cdkn2b, and cdk4 in healthy and inflamed gingival epithelium (ge) and connective tissue (ct), and detected a significantly higher expression of cdkn2bas in healthy ct compared to ge (p=0.004). after 24 h of stimulation with porphyromonas gingivalis in streptococcus gordonii pre-treated gingival fibroblast (hgf) and cultured gingival epithelial cells (gecs), we observed a 25-fold and fourfold increase of cdkn2bas gene expression in hgfs (p=0.003) and gecs (p=0.004), respectively. considering the global importance of cdkn2bas in the disease risk of chd, this observation supports the theory of inflammatory components in the disease physiology of chd.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == effect of the antimicrobial decapeptide ksl on the growth of oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  == dental caries and periodontitis are common oral bacterial infectious diseases. their prevention and treatment requires control of the causative pathogens, such  as streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis, that exist within dental plaque. as one of the attractive future substitutes for conventional antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (amps), both natural and synthetic, have been widely tested and used for controlling bacterial infections. in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of ksl (kkvvfkvkfk-nh(2)), a novel amp, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria as well as candida albicans in vitro. streptococcus mutans, the causative agent of dental caries, was chosen for in-depth testing. bacterial susceptibility and time-kill assays were performed to investigate the sensitivity of s. mutans to ksl. the effect of ksl on biofilm formation and on pre-formed biofilm was also examined. for biofilm studies, confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) was used to observe and analyse bacterial biofilm. the results showed that ksl had antimicrobial activity against a variety of oral bacteria and fungi. streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus acidophilus were the most susceptible strains to ksl peptide [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 0.0625 mg/ml] compared with other species tested (mics of 0.125-1mg/ml). ksl also inhibited s.  mutans biofilm formation, with a minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of 0.0625-0.125 mg/ml, and reduced 1-day-old developed s. mutans biofilm, with a minimum biofilm reduction concentration of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. clsm images showed that ksl significantly reduced the viability of biofilm cells. this study suggests that ksl may have a potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == mechanistic studies of agmatine deiminase from multiple bacterial species.
AB  == one subfamily of guanidino group-modifying enzymes (gmes) consists of the agmatine deiminases (agds). these enzymes catalyze the conversion of agmatine (decarboxylated arginine) to n-carbamoyl putrescine and ammonia. in plants, viruses, and bacteria, these enzymes are thought to be involved in energy production, biosynthesis of polyamines, and biofilm formation. in particular, we  are interested in the role that this enzyme plays in pathogenic bacteria. previously, we reported the initial kinetic characterization of the agmatine deiminase from helicobacter pylori and described the synthesis and characterization the two most potent agd inactivators. herein, we have expanded our initial efforts to characterize the catalytic mechanisms of agd from h. pylori as well as streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. through the  use of ph rate profiles, pk(a) measurements of the active site cysteine, solvent  isotope effects, and solvent viscosity effects, we have determined that the agds, like pads 1 and 4, utilize a reverse protonation mechanism.

TI  == efficacy and safety of adjunctive local moxifloxacin delivery in the treatment of periodontitis.
AB  == background: moxifloxacin exerts excellent antibacterial activity against most putative periodontal pathogens and has been shown to kill bacteria in biofilm and host cells. methods: patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to receive a single subgingival application of a 0.125%, 0.4%, or 1.25% moxifloxacin gel or placebo gel immediately after full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp). clinical efficacy measurements were assessed in sites with baseline probing depth (pd) of >/=5.4 mm at 6 weeks and 3 months and any adverse  events were determined. in addition, putative periodontal pathogens and resistance of subgingival bacteria against moxifloxacin were assessed. results: data of 57 patients were included in the statistical analysis. in all treatment groups, the pd decreased from baseline to 3 months, with the greatest reduction seen in patients treated with moxifloxacin 0.4% (1.5 +/- 0.6 mm; p = 0.023 compared to placebo), followed by patients receiving moxifloxacin 1.25% (1.2 +/-  0.4), moxifloxacin 0.125% (1.1 +/- 1.1), and placebo (1.0 +/- 0.6). no linear trend for pd reduction with increasing moxifloxacin concentrations was found. porphyromonas gingivalis showed the greatest reduction in prevalence among the assessed pathogens, without any significant intergroup differences. no correlation or systematic relationship between adverse events, including bacterial resistance against moxifloxacin, and the investigational gels was found. conclusions: in periodontal pockets with pd of >/=5.4 mm, a single subgingival administration of a 0.4% moxifloxacin gel as an adjunct to srp may result in additional pd reduction compared to srp alone. in addition, the investigated moxifloxacin gels seem to be safe.

TI  == selective substitution of amino acids limits proteolytic cleavage and improves the bioactivity of an anti-biofilm peptide that targets the periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the interaction of the periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis, with oral  streptococci such as streptococcus gordonii precedes colonization of the subgingival pocket and represents a target for limiting p. gingivalis colonization of the oral cavity. previous studies showed that a synthetic peptide (designated bar) derived from the antigen i/ii protein of s. gordonii was a potent competitive inhibitor of p. gingivalis adherence to s. gordonii and subsequent biofilm formation. here we show that despite its inhibitory activity,  bar is rapidly degraded by intact p. gingivalis cells in vitro. however, in the presence of soluble mfa protein, the p. gingivalis receptor for bar, the peptide  is protected from proteolytic degradation suggesting that the affinity of bar for mfa is higher than for p. gingivalis proteases. the rate of bar degradation was reduced when the p. gingivalis lysine-specific gingipain was inhibited using the  specific protease inhibitor, z-fkck, or when the gene encoding the lys-gingipain  was inactivated. in addition, substituting d-lys for l-lys residues in bar prevented degradation of the peptide when incubated with the lys-gingipain and increased its specific adherence inhibitory activity in a s. gordonii-p. gingivalis dual species biofilm model. these results suggest that lys-gingipain accounts in large part for p. gingivalis-mediated degradation of bar and that more effective peptide inhibitors of p. gingivalis adherence to streptococci can  be produced by introducing modifications that limit the susceptibility of bar to  the lys-gingipain and other p. gingivalis associated proteases.

TI  == oral bacterial genome sequencing using the high-throughput roche genome sequencer flx system.
AB  == for over 30 years, the chain termination method of dna sequencing (commonly known as sanger sequencing) has been the mainstay of any dna sequencing project. in the past, whole-genome sequencing employing exclusively sanger chemistry has been a labor-intensive and costly exercise and an option unfeasible for the average research group. however, within the last 4 years, the introduction of three high-throughput sequencing technologies (454, solid, and illumina) has revolutionized genomics by facilitating unprecedented levels (up to gigabasepairs) of reliable dna sequence output in a relatively short time frame and at a much lower cost per sequenced basepair. here, we provide laboratory and  bioinformatic protocols that will allow the average research group to undertake high-throughput sequencing of oral bacterial genomes using the roche genome sequencer flx system which employs 454 pyrosequencing technology.

TI  == a streptococcal effector protein that inhibits porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm development.
AB  == dental plaque formation is a developmental process involving cooperation and competition within a diverse microbial community, approximately 70 % of which is  composed of an array of streptococci during the early stages of supragingival plaque formation. in this study, 79 cell-free culture supernatants from a variety of oral streptococci were screened to identify extracellular compounds that inhibit biofilm formation by the oral anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381. the majority of the streptococcal supernatants (61 isolates) resulted in lysis of p. gingivalis cells, and some (17 isolates) had no effect on cell viability, growth or biofilm formation. one strain, however, produced a supernatant that abolished biofilm formation without affecting growth rate. analysis of this activity led to the discovery that a 48&emsp14;kda protein was responsible for the inhibition. protein sequence identification and enzyme activity assays identified the effector protein as an arginine deiminase. to identify the mechanism(s) by which this protein inhibits biofilm formation, we began by examining the expression levels of genes encoding fimbrial subunits; surface structures known to be involved in biofilm development. quantitative rt-pcr analysis revealed that exposure of p. gingivalis cells to this protein for 1&emsp14;h resulted in the downregulation of genes encoding proteins that are the major subunits of two distinct types of thin, single-stranded fimbriae (fima and  mfa1). furthermore, this downregulation occurred in the absence of arginine deiminase enzymic activity. hence, our data indicate that p. gingivalis can sense this extracellular protein, produced by an oral streptococcus (streptococcus intermedius), and respond by downregulating expression of cell-surface appendages required for attachment and biofilm development.

TI  == role of arginine deiminase of streptococcus cristatus in porphyromonas gingivalis colonization.
AB  == the ability to attach to a variety of oral surfaces is an important characteristic of porphyromonas gingivalis. previous studies have demonstrated that expression and production of fima, a major subunit protein of the long fimbriae, is required for p. gingivalis colonization. here we report that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (arca) of streptococcus cristatus, represses  fima production and inhibits biofilm formation of p. gingivalis. this inhibitory  function of arca is also observed in the formation of heterotypic p. gingivalis-streptococcus gordonii biofilms. p. gingivalis is released from streptococcal substrates in the presence of arca, likely due to an inhibition of  fima production. this work suggests that arca may have the potential to be a specific antibiofilm agent to fight p. gingivalis infections.

TI  == characterization of the normal bacterial flora in peri-implant sulci of partially and completely edentulous patients.
AB  == purpose: to characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. materials and methods: clinical and radiographic parameters were  recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: in all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. the frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (a actino?mycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, t forsythensis, t denticola) was significantly higher around natural  teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. in contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. conclusions: in healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. in partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.

AB  == objective: this study explored the effect of surgical endodontic treatment of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. study design: endodontic surgery was conducted on a case of refractory periapical periodontitis with extraradicular biofilm. during the procedure, the samples of periapical tissues were collected for microbiologic analysis. the resected root ends were observed under scanning electron microscope. the patient was recalled every 3 months to evaluate the treatment effect for 1 year. results: the samples yielded  1 type of facultative anaerobic bacteria (streptococcus sanguis) and 2 types of obligate anaerobic bacteria (porphynomonas endodontalis and prevotella oralis). mature bacteria biofilms were formed on the surface of the root apexes. at the 1-year recall visit, the radiograph and the clinic examination showed the refractory periapical periodontitis was cured successfully. conclusions: the periapical bacterial biofilm may contribute to the refractory periapical periodontitis. endodontic surgery is a good option for definitive removal of an established extraradicular infection.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == effects of a composition containing lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  == we report a clinical trial of the effects of test tablets containing bovine lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria. fifteen subjects with volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in mouth air above the olfactory threshold (h(2)s >1.5 or ch(3)sh >0.5 ng/10 ml) as detected by gas chromatography were enrolled in the trial. either a test or a placebo tablet was ingested twice  at 1-h intervals in two crossover phases. mouth air was monitored for vsc levels  at the baseline before ingestion of a tablet, 10 min after the first ingestion, 1 h (just before the second ingestion), and 2 h after the first ingestion. whole saliva was analyzed at the baseline and at 2 h for bacterial numbers. at 10 min,  the level of ch(3)sh was significantly lower in the test group (median [interquartile range] = 0.28 [0.00-0.68] ng/10 ml) compared to that in the placebo group (0.73 [0.47-1.00] ng/10 ml; p = 0.011). the median concentration of ch(3)sh in the test group was below the olfactory threshold after 10 min until 2  h, whereas the level in the placebo group was above the threshold during the experimental period. no difference in the numbers of salivary bacteria was detected by culturing or quantitative pcr, but terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism detected one fragment with a significantly lower copy number  at 2 h in the test group (mean +/- standard error, 4.89 +/- 0.11 log(10) copies/10 microl) compared to that in the placebo group (5.38 +/- 0.15 log(10) copies/10 microl; p = 0.033). these results indicate a suppressive effect of the  test composition on oral malodor and suggest an influence on oral bacteria.

TI  == roles of oral bacteria in cardiovascular diseases--from molecular mechanisms to clinical cases: porphyromonas gingivalis is the important role of intimal hyperplasia in the aorta.
AB  == it has been reported that dna of oral bacterial species, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans, was detected frequently in specimens of arteriosclerotic vessels. however, the source of dna, whether from live intact bacteria or a part of the bacteria, has not been identified yet. moreover, there  was no precise evidence concerning involvement of oral bacteria in the progression of arteriosclerosis. we tried to clarify the involvement of p. gingivalis on the mechanisms of development of aortic intimal hyperplasia. intravenous administration of p. gingivalis dramatically induced intimal hyperplasia in the mouse model with photochemical impairment of the femoral artery. however there were no changes identified in the mice without aortic impairment, even with the p. gingivalis infection. concomitantly, s100 calcium-binding protein a9 (s100a9) and the embryonic isoform of myosin heavy chain (smemb), a proliferative phenotypic marker of smooth muscle cells, were significantly overexpressed on the surfaces of smooth muscle cells present in the injured blood vessels. similarly, increased expressions of s100a9 and smemb proteins were observed in aneurismal specimens obtained from p. gingivalis-infected patients. we found that bacteremia induced by p. gingivalis leads to intimal hyperplasia associated with overexpressions of s100a9 and smemb. our results strongly suggest that oral-hematogenous spreading of p. gingivalis is a causative event in the development of aortic hyperplasia in periodontitis patients.

TI  == identification of immunological parameters associated with the alveolar bone level in periodontal patients.
AB  == purpose: the present study was performed to clarify the relationship between periodontal disease severity and selected immunological parameters consisting of  serum igg titer against periodontopathogenic bacteria, the expression of the helper t-cell cytokine by gingival mononuclear cells, and patients' immunoreactivity to cross-reactive heat shock protein (hsp) epitope peptide from  p. gingivalis hsp60. methods: twenty-five patients with moderate periodontitis had their gingival connective tissue harvested of gingival mononuclear cells during an open flap debridement procedure and peripheral blood was drawn by venipuncture to collect serum. the mean level of interproximal alveolar bone was  calculated to be used as an index for periodontal disease severity for a given patient. each of selected immunologic parameters was subject to statistical management to seek their correlations with the severity of periodontal disease. results: a significant correlation could not be identified between serum igg titers against specific bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus mutans) and the severity of periodontal disease. expression of interleukin (il)-10 by gingival mononuclear cells was statistically significant in the group of patients who had higher levels of alveolar bone height. however,  a similar correlation could not be demonstrated in cases for il-4 or interferon-gamma. patients' serum reactivity to cross-reactive epitope peptide showed a significant correlation with the amount of alveolar bone. conclusions: it was concluded that expression of il-10 by gingival mononuclear cells and patients' sero-reactivity to the cross-reactive hsp peptide of p. gingivalis hsp60 were significantly correlated with alveolar bone height.

TI  == the changing faces of streptococcus antigen i/ii polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  == streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii (agi/ii) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in gram-positive bacteria. it mediates attachment of s. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. the agi/ii family polypeptides recognize salivary  glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation,  tissue invasion and immune modulation. the genes encoding agi/ii family polypeptides are found among streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. suis. evidence of functionalities for different regions of the agi/ii proteins has emerged. a sequence motif within the c-terminal portion of streptococcus gordonii sspb (agi/ii) is bound by porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. the significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. a new picture emerges of the central v (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench,  being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an n-terminal alpha-helix and a c-terminal polyproline helix. this presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == development of snap-tag-mediated live cell labeling as an alternative to gfp in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an anaerobic periodontal pathogen that resides in the complex multispecies microbial biofilm known as dental plaque. effective reporter tools are increasingly needed to facilitate physiological and pathogenetic studies of dental biofilm. fluorescent proteins are ideal reporters for conveniently monitoring biofilm growth, but are restricted by several environmental factors, such as a requirement of oxygen to emit fluorescence. we developed a fluorescent reporter plasmid, known as the snap-tag, for labeling p.  gingivalis cells, which encode an engineered version of the human dna repair enzyme o(6)-alkylguanine-dna alkyltransferase. fluorescent substrates containing  o(6)-benzylguanine covalently and specifically bind to the enzyme via stable thioether bonds. for the present study, we constructed a replicative plasmid carrying snap26b under the control of the p. gingivalis endogenous trxb promoter. the p. gingivalis-expressing snap26 protein was successfully labeled with specific fluorophores under anaerobic conditions. porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm formation was investigated using flow cells and confocal laser scanning microscopy. a specific distribution of a strong fluorescence signal was demonstrated in p. gingivalis-snap26 monospecies and bispecies biofilms with streptococcus gordonii-gfpmut3(*). these findings show that the snap-tag can be applied to studies of anaerobic bacteria in biofilm models and is a useful and advantageous alternative to existing labeling strategies.

AB  == background and objective: qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. the aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. the amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific  primers, respectively. results: the proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). among obligate anaerobes, tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. by contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). specifically, the proportion of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis or e. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. conclusion: obligate anaerobes, including t. forthysia, p. gingivalis and e. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas  streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. the proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.

AB  == fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as  an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. while n-3 pufa have  been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. the n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and alpha-linolenic acid (ala), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, alaee, epaee, dhaee were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. this study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three  major n-3 pufa, epa, dha, and ala, and their ester derivatives. our experimental  data indicated that n-3 pufa and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. this study suggested that n-3 pufa could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.

AB  == protease-activated receptors (pars), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) receptors and toll-like receptors (tlrs) play a role in innate immunity, but little is known about interaction between these receptors. the goal of this study was to investigate how silencing one receptor affects the expression of other receptors and downstream innate immune markers in response to bacteria. human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) were transfected with sirna specific for par1 or par2, then stimulated with periopathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, bridging organism between pathogens and non-pathogens fusobacterium nucleatum, or non-pathogen streptococcus gordonii. par1 or par2 knock-down resulted in up-regulated nod1 and nod2 expression with p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum stimulation (p<0.01), as well as enhanced tlr2 and tlr4 expression when cells were stimulated by bacteria that utilize tlr2 or tlr4, respectively. involvement  of pars for induction of cc chemokine ligand 20 (ccl20), a cytokine with antimicrobial properties, was observed following stimulation of the three bacterial species. furthermore, results from multiple cytokine elisa array showed receptors utilized in the induction of various innate immune markers are tailored to individual bacterium tested. our data suggest complex interplay of several receptors is required for appropriate innate immune responses to the different types of bacteria present within the oral cavity and that receptor expression itself is altered depending on which organism the cell encounters.

TI  == a new antibacterial compound from luo han kuo fruit extract (siraitia grosvenori).
AB  == luo han kuo fruit (siraitia grosvenori swingle) has been used in china for centuries as a sweetening agent, and also used to treat sore throat and cough. in our recent study, a new bioactive compound, (2r,3s,4s)-2,3-trans-3,4-cis-5,3'-bimethoxy-7-(trans-2-propenal)-3,4-flavandiol (1), named siraitiflavandiol was obtained. the structure has been determined on the basis of spectroscopic studies including 1d and 2d nmr ((1)h, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, hsqc, hmbc, and noesy), cd, ei-ms, and hr-ei-ms spectra. the new  compound was evaluated in vitro for its inhibitory ability against the growth of  oral bacterial species streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and yeast  candida albicans. the minimum inhibitory concentrations were 6, 24, and 6 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == periodontitis, periodontopathic bacteria and lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin (lf) is a component of saliva and is suspected to be a defense factor against oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans and candida albicans. periodontitis is a very common oral disease caused by periodontopathic bacteria.  antimicrobial activities and other biological effects of lf against representative periodontopathic bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia, have been widely studied. association of polymorphisms in lf with incidence of aggressive periodontitis and the role of lf in the gingival crevicular fluid as a marker of periodontitis severity have also been reported. periodontopathic bacteria reside as a biofilm in supragingival and subgingival plaque. our recent study indicated that lf exhibits antibacterial activity against planktonic forms of p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia at higher concentrations, and furthermore, lf effectively inhibits biofilm formation and reduces the established biofilm of these bacteria at physiological concentrations. a small-scale clinical study indicated that oral administration of bovine lf reduces p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the subgingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients. lf seems to be a biofilm inhibitor of periodontopathic bacteria in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == two intramolecular isopeptide bonds are identified in the crystal structure of the streptococcus gordonii sspb c-terminal domain.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is a primary colonizer and is involved in the formation of dental plaque. this bacterium expresses several surface proteins. one of them is  the adhesin sspb, which is a member of the antigen i/ii family of proteins. sspb  is a large multi-domain protein that has interactions with surface molecules on other bacteria and on host cells, and is thus a key factor in the formation of biofilms. here, we report the crystal structure of a truncated form of the sspb c-terminal domain, solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion to 1.5 a resolution. the structure represents the first of a c-terminal domain from a streptococcal antigen i/ii protein and is comprised of two structurally related beta-sandwich domains, c2 and c3, both with a ca(2+) bound in equivalent positions. in each of the domains, a covalent isopeptide bond is observed between a lysine and an asparagine, a feature that is believed to be a common stabilization mechanism in gram-positive surface proteins. s. gordonii biofilms contain attachment sites for the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis and the sspb c-terminal domain has been shown to have one such recognition motif, the sspb adherence region. the motif protrudes from the protein, and serves as a  handle for attachment. the structure suggests several additional putative binding surfaces, and other binding clefts may be created when the full-length protein is folded.

TI  == oral bacterial extracts facilitate early osteogenic/dentinogenic differentiation  in human dental pulp-derived cells.
AB  == objectives: bacterial metabolites demineralize dental hard tissues, and soluble factors lead to tertiary dentinogenesis in the area of the dentin-pulp complex. however, it is unclear whether the oral bacteria are directly involved in the differentiation of dental pulp cells. in this study, we evaluated the effect of oral bacterial extracts on cellular differentiation in human dental pulp-derived  cells (hdpc). study design: the hdpc were obtained from third molar teeth, and the cells were subcultured. the sonicated extracts were obtained from porphyromonas gingivalis (gram-negative) and streptococcus mutans (gram-positive). the effect of bacterial extracts on cellular growth and differentiation in hdpc were tested. results: alkaline phosphatase activity and bone sialoprotein (bsp) gene expression were increased in hdpc exposed to low concentrations of both sonicated extracts, whereas the activity was decreased upon exposure to high concentrations of sonicated extracts from p. gingivalis. conclusion: this is the first evidence that oral bacteria have a positive effect  on cellular differentiation in hpdc.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == epithelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine response differs across dental plaque bacterial species.
AB  == aim: the dental plaque is comprised of numerous bacterial species, which may or may not be pathogenic. human gingival epithelial cells (hgecs) respond to perturbation by various bacteria of the dental plaque by production of different  levels of inflammatory cytokines, which is a putative reflection of their virulence. the aim of the current study was to determine responses in terms of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 secretion induced by porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus gordonii in order to gauge their virulence potential. materials and methods: hgecs were challenged with the four bacterial species, live or heat killed, at various multiplicity of infections and the elicited il-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 responses were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: primary hgecs challenged with live p. gingivalis produced high levels of il-1beta, while challenge with live a. actinomycetemcomitans gave high levels of  il-8. the opportunistic pathogen f. nucleatum induces the highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the commensal s. gordonii is the least stimulatory. conclusion: we conclude that various dental plaque biofilm bacteria  induce different cytokine response profiles in primary hgecs that may reflect their individual virulence or commensal status.

TI  == bactericidal effects of different laser systems on bacteria adhered to dental implant surfaces: an in vitro study comparing zirconia with titanium.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to examine in vitro the anti-bacterial  efficacy of two different laser systems (co(2) and diode) applied to streptococcus sanguinis or porphyromonas gingivalis cells in suspensions or adhered to zirconia or titanium dental implant materials, with two different surfaces each. materials and methods: bacteria were irradiated at two different power settings with either a co(2) (lambda=10,600 nm) or a diode laser (lambda=810 nm). the lower mode is used clinically (for co(2) 100 j/cm(2), diode  50 j/cm(2)) and the higher may alter the materials' surface (for co(2) 1200 j/cm(2), diode 150 j/cm(2)). after irradiation, the number of viable bacteria was determined by culture. results: planktonic cells of both species were more resistant to the laser irradiations than bacteria that adhered to surfaces. adhered p. gingivalis were effectively killed at both wavelengths lambda=10,600 and 810 nm even at the lower settings, independent of the material. s. sanguinis  cells that adhered to either zirconia surface were effectively killed by the co(2) laser at the lower setting of 100 j/cm(2). however, the higher settings of  both lasers were needed to reduce s. sanguinis that adhered to titanium surfaces. the co(2) laser at the lower setting and the diode laser at the higher setting effectively reduced the viability of s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis that adhered to zirconia surfaces. conclusions: under irradiation conditions known not to alter zirconia implant surfaces in vitro, both co(2) laser (100 j/cm(2)) and the  diode laser (150 j/cm(2)) effectively reduced the viability of adhered s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis.

TI  == how microorganisms avoid phagocyte attraction.
AB  == microorganisms have developed several mechanisms to modulate the host immune system to increase their survival and propagation in the host. their presence in  the host is not only revealed by self-produced peptides but also through host-derived chemokines and active complement fragments. these so-called chemoattractants are recognized by g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) expressed  on leukocyte cell membranes. activation of gpcrs triggers leukocyte activation and guides their recruitment to the site of infection. therefore, gpcrs play a central role in leukocyte trafficking leading to microbial clearance. it is therefore not surprising that microorganisms are able to sabotage this arm of the immune response. different microorganisms have evolved a variety of tactics to modulate gpcr activation. here, we review the mechanisms and proteins used by major human pathogens and less virulent microorganisms that affect gpcr signaling. while viruses generally produce receptor and chemoattractant mimics, parasites and bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bordetella pertussis secrete proteins that affect receptor signaling, directly antagonize receptors, cleave stimuli, and even prevent stimulus generation. as the large arsenal of gpcr modulators aids prolonged microbial persistence in the host, their study provides us a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis.

TI  == molecular analysis of aortic intimal hyperplasia caused by porphyromonas gingivalis infection in mice with endothelial damage.
AB  == background and objective: porphyromonas gingivalis infection is thought to be a significant etiological factor in the development of cardiovascular diseases. however, scant definitive evidence has been presented concerning the pathological molecular mechanisms of these disorders. in the present study, we performed a molecular analysis of the developmental mechanisms of aortic intimal hyperplasia  induced by p. gingivalis. material and methods: the effects of p. gingivalis-induced bacteremia on intimal hyperplasia were evaluated using a mouse model of aortic hyperplasia created by photochemical-induced endothelial cell injury. alterations of gene expression profiles in injured blood vessels of the mice were extensively analyzed using dna microarray assays to identify the key molecules involved in p. gingivalis-induced hyperplasia. in addition, human aneurismal specimens from patients with or without p. gingivalis infection were analyzed histochemically. results: intravenous administration of p. gingivalis dramatically induced intimal hyperplasia in the mouse model. concomitantly, s100  calcium-binding protein a9 (s100a9) and embryonic isoform of myosin heavy chain (smemb), a proliferative phenotypic marker of smooth muscle cells, were significantly overexpressed on the surfaces of smooth muscle cells present in the injured blood vessels. similarly, increased expressions of s100a9 and smemb proteins were observed in aneurismal specimens obtained from p. gingivalis-infected patients. conclusion: we found that bacteremia induced by p.  gingivalis leads to intimal hyperplasia associated with overexpressions of s100a9 and smemb. our results strongly suggest that oral-hematogenous spreading of p. gingivalis is a causative event in the development of aortic hyperplasia in periodontitis patients.

TI  == hydrogen sulfide production from cysteine and homocysteine by periodontal and oral bacteria.
AB  == background: hydrogen sulfide is one of the predominant volatile sulfur compounds  (vscs) produced by oral bacteria. this study developed and evaluated a system for detecting hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria. methods: l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase (metase) and beta carbon-sulfur (beta c-s) lyase were used to degrade homocysteine and cysteine, respectively, to produce hydrogen sulfide. enzymatic reactions resulting in hydrogen sulfide production were assayed by reaction with bismuth trichloride, which forms a black precipitate when mixed with hydrogen sulfide. the enzymatic activities of various oral bacteria that result in hydrogen sulfide production and the capacity of bacteria from periodontal sites to form hydrogen sulfide in reaction mixtures containing l-cysteine or dl-homocysteine were assayed. results: with l-cysteine as the substrate, streptococcus anginosus fw73 produced the most  hydrogen sulfide, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis american type culture collection (atcc) 33277 and w83 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 produced approximately 35% of the amount produced by the p. gingivalis strains. finally, the hydrogen sulfide found in subgingival plaque was analyzed. using bismuth trichloride, the hydrogen sulfide produced by oral bacteria was visually detectable as a black precipitate. conclusions: hydrogen sulfide production by oral bacteria was easily analyzed using bismuth trichloride. however, further innovation is required for practical use.

TI  == clinical status and detection of periodontopathogens and streptococcus mutans in  children with high levels of supragingival biofilm.
AB  == knowledge about the presence of some important oral pathogens is an important step in better identifying children at risk for periodontal and/or caries diseases in later life. the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of streptococcus mutans (sm), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), and tannerella forsythia (tf) in gingival biofilm samples from 196 children, and to assess whether any of these pathogens are more associated with gingival inflammation extension and the decayed/missing/filled teeth (dmft/dmft)  index. the subjects presented plaque index greater than 80% and were divided in 3 groups according to the bleeding index (bi): i) low bleeding (< 30%), ii) medium  bleeding (31 - 59%) and iii) high bleeding (> 60%). the presence of each pathogen was determined by pcr. the prevalence of sm was 71.9% and the mean dmft/dmft was  6.68. the prevalence in low, medium and high bleeding groups was 43.5%, 34.5% and 46.7% for aa; 43.5%, 37.9%, and 36.7% for cr; 99.1%, 100%, and 96.7% for pg; 56.5%, 56.9%, and 66.7% for pi; and 58.3%, 60.3%, and 56.7% for tf, respectively. pg (99.0%) was the most prevalent periodontal pathogen detected followed by tf (58.7%), pi (58.2%), aa (41.3%) and cr (40.8%). our study indicated that in this  high plaque index population studied, a high prevalence of sm and high mean dmft  were observed. in addition, the presence of pi was associated with the presence of inflammation (p < 0.05) whereas cr was associated with periodontal health (p < 0.05).

TI  == negative correlation of distributions of streptococcus cristatus and porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major causative agents of adult periodontitis. one of the features of this periodontal pathogen is its ability to attach to a variety of oral bacterial surfaces and to colonize subgingival dental plaque. we have shown that streptococcus cristatus cc5a inhibits expression of fima, a gene encoding the major protein subunit of long fimbriae in p. gingivalis; as a result, s. cristatus interrupts formation of p. gingivalis biofilms. here we further demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of s. cristatus affects multiple strains of p. gingivalis and that optimal inhibitory activity correlates with levels of arginine deiminase expression in s. cristatus. more strikingly, the impact of s. cristatus on p. gingivalis colonization was revealed by comparing levels of p. gingivalis and s. cristatus in subgingival dental plaque. spearman correlation analysis indicated a negative correlation between the distributions of s. cristatus and p. gingivalis (r = -0.57; p < 0.05). these data suggest that some early colonizers of dental plaque, such as s. cristatus, may be beneficial to the host by antagonizing the colonization and accumulation of periodontal pathogens such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == polymorphism of salivary histatin gene and periodontal disease in the japanese population.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a widespread and major dental disease. recent studies have analyzed a possible relationship between polymorphism of several genes and periodontitis. histatins are salivary polypeptides with fungicidal activities against candida albicans and yeast and bactericidal activities against porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans. histatins are part of the innate defense of the oral cavity. we examined the frequency of the polymorphism  codon 23 of the histatin 3 gene (his2 allele) in relation to periodontitis in the japanese population. the subjects were 143 japanese individuals, of which 63 were healthy control subjects and 80 were periodontal patients. we isolated genomic dna from lingual mucosal cells and tested them for single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp). the incidence of polymorphism was analyzed statistically by fisher's  exact test. the results indicated that the gene polymorphism at codon 23 of the histatin 3 gene was not associated with periodontitis in the japanese population  (p = 0.166). rather, if at all, it appeared to be associated with resistance to periodontitis.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == identification of the binding domain of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis forms communities with antecedent oral biofilm constituent streptococci. p. gingivalis major fimbriae bind to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) present on the streptococcal surface, and this interaction plays an important role in p. gingivalis colonization. this study identified the binding domain of streptococcus oralis gapdh for p. gingivalis fimbriae. s. oralis recombinant gapdh (rgapdh) was digested with lysyl endopeptidase. cleaved fragments of rgapdh were applied to a  reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatograph equipped with a c18 column. each peak was collected; the binding activity toward p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin (rfima) was analyzed with a biomolecular interaction analysis system.  the fragment displaying the strongest binding activity was further digested with  various proteinases, after which the binding activity of each fragment was measured. the amino acid sequence of each fragment was determined by direct sequencing, mass spectrometric analysis, and amino acid analysis. amino acid residues 166 to 183 of s. oralis gapdh exhibited the strongest binding activity toward rfima; confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 166 to 183 of s. oralis gapdh (pep166-183, dnfgvveglmttihaytg) inhibits s. oralis-p. gingivalis biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. moreover, pep166-183 inhibited interbacterial biofilm formation by several oral streptococci and p. gingivalis strains with different types of fima. these results indicate that the binding domain of s. oralis gapdh for p. gingivalis fimbriae exists within the region encompassing amino acid residues 166 to 183 of gapdh and that pep166-183 may be a potent inhibitor of p. gingivalis colonization in the oral cavity.

AB  == introduction: clinical/microbiological studies have consistently revealed the persistence of some bacteria after conventional root canal debridement. although  this was originally attributed to the complexity of the root canal anatomy and the difficulty of delivering antibacterial agents effectively, it has emerged that the biofilm encasement of bacterial cells may confer a further mechanism of  resistance. the purpose of this study was to investigate the relative disruption  and bactericidal effects of root canal irrigants on single- and dual-species biofilms of root canal isolates. methods: biofilms of streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were grown on nitrocellulose membranes for 72 hours and immersed in naocl, edta, chlorhexidine, and iodine for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. the number of viable and nonviable bacteria disrupted from the biofilm and those remaining adherent were determined by using a viability stain in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. results: gram-negative obligate anaerobe species were more susceptible to cell removal than gram-positive facultative anaerobes. the majority of cells were disrupted after the first minute of exposure; however, the extent varied according to the agent and species. the most effective agent at disrupting biofilms was naocl. iodine was generally effective at bacterial killing but not disruption. conclusions: biofilm disruption and cell viability were influenced by the species, their coassociation in dual-species biofilms, the test agent, and the duration of exposure. the effectiveness of naocl as an endodontic irrigant was reinforced.

TI  == the effect of lactoferrin on oral bacterial attachment.
AB  == introduction: lactoferrin (lf), an iron-binding salivary glycoprotein, plays an important role in human innate defense against local mucosal infection. we hypothesized that lf interferes with initial oral bacterial attachment to surfaces by iron sequestration, so inhibiting subsequent biofilm formation. the objective was to investigate the effect of lf on the early stages of single-species and multi-species oral biofilm development. methods: streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were used in this study. glass disks of a two-track flow cell coated with flowing artificial saliva (0.3 ml/min) with and without lf (100 microg/ml) were used for studying bacterial attachment (3 h, 37 degrees c). attachment was also examined by incubating single or multiple species of test bacteria (10(7) colony-forming units/ml) with lf-coated (20-100 microg/ml) and uncoated glass slides. the effects of beta-lactoglobulin, 2,2'-dipyridyl (25-100 microg/ml), an  iron chelator, and fecl3 on attachment were also examined. results: lf inhibited  the initial attachment of s. gordonii (50.3%, p < 0.05) but not that of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. however, the attachment of a dual-species biofilm containing s. gordonii (i.e. s. gordonii/f. nucleatum or s. gordonii/p. gingivalis) was significantly reduced (48.7% or 62.1%, respectively, p < 0.05) in the presence of lf. beta-lactoglobulin did not affect the attachment of s. gordonii. in the presence of 100 microm 2,2'-dipyridyl, attachment of s. gordonii was reduced by 53.87%. no reduction in attachment was noted in s. gordonii pretreated with lf (100 microg/ml) and fecl3 (20-200 microm). conclusion: lf suppresses initial attachment of s. gordonii and s. gordonii coaggregates by iron sequestration. this may lead to subsequent inhibition of oral biofilm development.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

TI  == the degree of microbiome complexity influences the epithelial response to infection.
AB  == background: the human microflora is known to be extremely complex, yet most pathogenesis research is conducted in mono-species models of infection. consequently, it remains unclear whether the level of complexity of a host's indigenous flora can affect the virulence potential of pathogenic species. furthermore, it remains unclear whether the colonization by commensal species affects a host cell's response to pathogenic species beyond the direct physical saturation of surface receptors, the sequestration of nutrients, the modulation of the physico-chemical environment in the oral cavity, or the production of bacteriocins. using oral epithelial cells as a model, we hypothesized that the virulence of pathogenic species may vary depending on the complexity of the flora that interacts with host cells. results: this is the first report that determines the global epithelial transcriptional response to co-culture with defined complex microbiota. in our model, human immortalized gingival keratinocytes (higk) were infected with mono- and mixed cultures of commensal and pathogenic species. the global transcriptional response of infected cells was validated and confirmed phenotypically. in our model, commensal species were able to modulate the expression of host genes with a broad diversity of physiological functions and antagonize the effect of pathogenic species at the cellular level. unexpectedly,  the inhibitory effect of commensal species was not correlated with its ability to inhibit adhesion or invasion by pathogenic species. conclusion: studying the global transcriptome of epithelial cells to single and complex microbial challenges offers clues towards a better understanding of how bacteria-bacteria interactions and bacteria-host interactions impact the overall host response. this work provides evidence that the degree of complexity of a mixed microbiota does influence the transcriptional response to infection of host epithelial cells, and challenges the current dogma regarding the potential versus the actual pathogenicity of bacterial species. these findings support the concept that members of the commensal oral flora have evolved cellular mechanisms that directly modulate the host cell's response to pathogenic species and dampen their relative pathogenicity.

TI  == new methods for selective isolation of bacterial dna from human clinical specimens.
AB  == separation of bacterial dna from human dna in clinical samples may have an important impact on downstream applications, involving microbial diagnostic systems. we evaluated two commercially available reagents (molysis), molzym gmbh  & co. kg, bremen and pureprove, sirs-lab gmbh, jena, both germany) for their potential to isolate and purify bacterial dna from human dna. we chose oral samples, which usually contain very high amounts of both human and bacterial cells. three different dna preparations each were made from eight caries and eight periodontal specimens using the two reagents above and a conventional dna extraction strategy as reference. based on target-specific real-time-quantitative pcr assays we compared the reduction of human dna versus loss of bacterial dna. human dna was monitored by targeting the beta-2-microglobulin gene, while bacteria were monitored by targeting 16s rdna (total bacteria and porphyromonas gingivalis) or the glycosyltransferase gene (streptococcus mutans). we found that in most cases at least 90% of human dna could successfully be removed, with complete removal in eight of 16 cases using molysis, and two (of 16) cases using  pureprove. conversely, detection of bacterial dna was possible in all cases with  a recovery rate generally ranging from 35% to 50%. in conclusion, both strategies have the potential to reduce background interference from the host dna which may  be of remarkable value for nucleic-acid based microbial diagnostic systems.

TI  == methods for optimizing dna extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time pcr.
AB  == methods for the optimal extraction of genomic dna for real-time pcr enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and fusobacterium nucleatum. traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of dna content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time pcr approach. evidence was obtained that p. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded dna from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. this nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol  at 4 degrees c overnight. a final purification of the dna to remove any potential pcr inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of dna by real-time pcr and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.

TI  == proteomics of porphyromonas gingivalis within a model oral microbial community.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontal pathogen that resides in a  complex multispecies microbial biofilm community known as dental plaque. confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that p. gingivalis can assemble into communities in vitro with streptococcus gordonii and fusobacterium nucleatum, common constituents of dental plaque. whole cell quantitative proteomics, along with mutant construction and analysis, were conducted to investigate how p. gingivalis adapts to this three species community. results: 1156 p. gingivalis proteins were detected qualitatively during comparison of the three species model community with p. gingivalis incubated alone under the same conditions. integration of spectral counting and summed signal intensity analyses of the dataset showed that 403 proteins were down-regulated and 89 proteins up-regulated. the proteomics results were inspected manually and an ontology analysis conducted using david. significant decreases were seen in proteins involved in cell shape and the formation of the cell envelope, as well as thiamine, cobalamin, and pyrimidine synthesis and dna repair. an overall increase was seen in proteins involved in protein synthesis. hmur, a tonb dependent outer membrane receptor, was up-regulated in the community and an hmur deficient mutant was deficient in three species community formation, but was unimpaired in its ability to form mono- or dual-species biofilms. conclusion: collectively, these results indicate that p. gingivalis can assemble into a heterotypic community with f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, and that a community lifestyle provides physiologic support for p. gingivalis. proteins such as hmur, that are up-regulated, can be necessary for community structure.

TI  == human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus inhibit oral bacteria-induced macrophage activation and phagocytosis.
AB  == introduction: periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused by periodontal microorganisms. viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) and epstein-barr virus (ebv) are associated with certain types of periodontal disease, but their roles in promoting the disease are unclear. because both viruses infect human macrophages, cells which play key roles in the clearance of  pathogenic bacteria, it is likely that the viruses alter the functional capacity  of macrophages by inhibiting their defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. methods: macrophages preinfected with hcmv or ebv were evaluated following stimulation by selected oral bacteria. bacteria-induced macrophage activation was assayed by measuring the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) produced in the media, and phagocytic activity was analysed by a phagocytosis assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria. the virus-infected macrophages were also subjected to semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression of toll-like receptor 9, which is involved in the activation of phagocytosis-related pathways. results: both hcmv and ebv significantly diminished the tnf-alpha production typically induced by oral bacteria, inhibited the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and downregulated the expression of toll-like receptor 9. conclusion: infection by hcmv or ebv inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge, thereby  suggesting their pathogenic role in the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == tgf-beta1 inhibits tlr-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  == tgf-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. odontoblasts  extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from tgf-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. this study aimed to determine the role of tgf-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. we show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors tlr2 and tlr4 on the cell surface. porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum activated both tlrs, but tlr4 played a greater role. lack of cell-surface tlr2 was associated with poor response to streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus casei. tgf-beta1 inhibited tlr2 and tlr4 expression and attenuated  odontoblast responses. our findings suggest that the balance between tlr-mediated inflammation and tgf-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in  pulpal inflammation.

TI  == tlr2 sensing of f. nucleatum and s. sanguinis distinctly triggered gingival innate response.
AB  == gingival tissue faces constant exposure to micro-organisms. it functions as part  of the host response, an anti-microbial barrier that recognizes and discriminates between commensal and pathogenic bacteria. this study aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of cell wall extracts from different periodontal bacteria, commensals streptococcus sanguinis and fusobacterium nucleatum and the pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, on the innate immune response of gingival keratinocytes and the role of tlr2 in regulating this. we assayed mrna levels to determine the  expression of human beta-defensins (hbetad2, hbetad3), interleukin-1alpha, -1beta, 6 and 8 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. f. nucleatum extracts induced beta-defensin and inflammatory marker mrna expression at higher levels than p. gingivalis. extracts from the gram-positive commensal s. sanguinis did not upregulate the host response. tlr2 extinction inhibited the upregulation of beta-defensin and cytokine transcripts by f. nucleatum extracts but, in contrast, led to a weak induction of hbetad3 after challenge with s. sanguinis extracts. although f. nucleatum strongly induces innate immune and inflammatory mediators,  s. sanguinis limits their expression through tlr2. together, our data demonstrate that gingival keratinocytes recognize and discriminate between gram-positive and  gram-negative commensal extracts, in part through tlr2, to activate different signaling pathways of the innate immune host response.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of hydrolytic enzymes as dental plaque control agents.
AB  == the plaque-control potential of commercially available amylase, lipase and protease was evaluated by observing their effects on coaggregation and on bacterial viability within various plaque microcosms. a quantitative coaggregation assay indicated that protease significantly inhibited the extent of coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis (p <0.05) and of porphyromonas gingivalis and s. oralis. amylase significantly (p <0.05) increased the coaggregation of a. naeslundii versus fusobacterium nucleatum and a. naeslundii versus p. gingivalis. concomitant challenge of constant-depth film fermenter-grown plaques with the enzymes did not result in detectable ecological  perturbations (assessed by differential culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). similar dosing and analysis of multiple sorbarod devices did not reveal increases in bacterial dispersion which could result from disaggregation of extant plaques. a short-term hydroxyapatite colonization model  was therefore used to investigate possible enzyme effects on early-stage plaque development. whilst culture did not indicate significant reductions in adhesion or plaque accumulation, a vital visual assay revealed significantly increased aggregation frequency following enzyme exposure. in summary, although hydrolytic  enzymes negatively influenced binary coaggregation, they did not cause statistically significant changes in bacterial viability within plaque microcosms. in contrast, enzyme exposure increased aggregation within extant plaques.

TI  == ceragenin csa-13 exhibits antimicrobial activity against cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: ceragenin csa-13 is a bile-acid-based mimic of endogenous antimicrobial peptides and shares a mechanism of action with many of these antimicrobial agents. because csa-13 is not peptide based, it is not a substrate  for the proteases that are found in the oral cavity, which are capable of degrading antimicrobial peptides. furthermore, the simplicity of the ceragenins makes them easier to prepare and purify than antimicrobial peptides. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial activities of csa-13 against oral pathogens  and found that this compound was bactericidal against all of the strains tested.  methods: the strains used were isolates of streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas species. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using agar dilution methods. in susceptibility testing, viable counts were determined after  incubation with csa-13. results: csa-13 was potent against all 23 strains tested  with mics of 1-8 microg/ml for s. mutans and 1-16 microg/ml for 24 strains of the genus porphyromonas. the mic(50) was 2 and the mic(90) was 8 mug/ml for s. mutans. mic ranges for protease-positive p. gingivalis and p. cangingivalis were  2-16 microg/ml, and 1-2 microg/ml for protease-negative p. circumdentaria. csa-13 interacted with lipopolysaccharide-sensitized erythrocytes at a concentration of  5.0-20.0 microg/ml. conclusion: csa-13 displays broad-spectrum activity against cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria. csa-13 was effective against protease-positive porphyromonas. it was shown to bind to erythrocytes coated with lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid from diverse bacterial strains. these results suggest that csa-13 may be useful for the prevention and treatment of oral microbial diseases.

AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

AB  == background/aim: we investigated the mechanisms of adherence of salivary and serum proteins, which mimic gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), to porphyromonas gingivalis, and the effects of these adhered proteins on coaggregation and hemagglutination properties. methods: the amounts of salivary and serum proteins  adhering to p. gingivalis were determined using (3)h-labeled and non-labeled proteins. the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and streptococcus oralis or streptococcus gordonii was observed. hemagglutination was evaluated using sheep erythrocytes. proteins that interacted with zinc or copper in saliva and serum and on p. gingivalis were examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. results: the amount of salivary or serum proteins that adhered to the surface of p. gingivalis strains was increased by cations, especially zinc and copper ions. the pretreatment of bacterial cells with salivary or serum proteins before the assay inhibited coaggregation with gram-positive bacteria and hemagglutination. these phenomena were enhanced by the presence of zinc or copper ions during the pretreatment of p. gingivalis with proteins. we detected protein bands that were related to these cations in saliva  and serum and on p. gingivalis. conclusions: our findings suggest that zinc and copper ions markedly enhanced the adhesion and accumulation of salivary and serum proteins on cells of p. gingivalis and inhibited the coaggregation and hemagglutination of p. gingivalis. these cations might be useful for limiting the settlement of p. gingivalis in the gingival sulcus with the goal of preventing periodontal disease.

AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == [preparation and antibacterial activity of quaternary ammonium salt monomers].
AB  == objective: to prepare three quaternary ammonium salt (qas) monomers, and to compare their antibacterial activities against four oral bacterial strains. methods: three antibacterial monomers [methacryloxyethyl benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (dmae-bc), methacryloxyethyl m-chloro benzyl dimethyl ammonium chloride  (dmae-m-cbc), methacryloxyethyl cetyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (dmae-cb)] were  synthesized according to the general structure of target monomers. their antibacterial effects were investigated using the broth dilution test on gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica ). results: three different monomers were successfully obtained. all the tested bacterial strains were susceptible to the three monomers, among which dmae-cb exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.2 to  4.8 mg/l. conclusions: all these three qas monomers have different antibacterial  activities against four oral bacteria strains. the data indicate that dmae-cb may be a candidate antibacterial agent for oral infectious diseases.

TI  == the effects of antibiotics on in vitro biofilm model of periodontal disease.
AB  == objective: periodontal disease is considered to be a bio?film infectious disease. the effects of macrolide and tetracycline on biofilm were examined in in vitro biofilm model made of periodontal disease-associated bacteria. methods: biofilms  were made on salivary pellicle by adding streptococcus gordonii for 2 days, followed by porphyromonas gingivalis inoculation for 2, 5, or 12 days. biofilms were treated with macrolide antibiotics; erythromycin (em), azithromycin (azm) and josamycin (jom) and tetracycline antibiotic, minocycline (mino). the effects  of these antibiotics on biofilms were examined using colorimetric quantification  method, scanning electron microscope (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). results: when antibiotics were added to the biofilm 2 days after inoculation of porphyromonas gingivalis (biofilm inhibition model), all four antibiotics decreased the number of bacteria by both colorimetric method and sem  observation. when antibiotics were added to biofilms 5 or 12 days after inoculation (biofilm destruction model), those in biofilms were decreased by em and azm compared with jom and mino. moreover, clsm observation demonstrated that  em and azm killed bacteria in biofilm more deeply than jom and mino. conclusion:  these results suggest the feasibility of em and azm for the treatment of periodontal disease as a biofilm infectious disease.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, gamma interferon, and a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix form a synergistic trio that induces c-jun n-terminal kinase 1-mediated nitric oxide generation and cell death.
AB  == during infection and inflammation, bacterial and inflammatory proteases break down extracellular matrices into macromolecular fragments. fibronectin fragments  are associated with disease severity in arthritis and periodontitis. the mechanisms by which these fragments contribute to disease pathogenesis are unclear. one likely mechanism is that fibronectin fragments induce apoptosis of resident cells, which can be further modulated by nitric oxide. nitric oxide levels are increased at inflammatory sites in periodontitis patients. the aim of  this study was to examine whether a proapoptotic fibronectin matrix (afn) exerts  its action by inducing nitric oxide and whether priming by bacterial and inflammatory components exacerbates this mechanism. our data demonstrate that afn increased the levels of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) dose and time dependently in periodontal ligament (pdl) cells. these effects and  apoptosis were inhibited by inos suppression and enhanced by inos overexpression. nitric oxide and inos induction were paralleled by increased c-jun n-terminal kinase 1 (jnk-1) phosphorylation. jnk-1 overexpression enhanced the expression of nitric oxide and inos, whereas inhibiting jnk-1 by small interfering rna or a kinase mutant reversed these findings. priming pdl cells with porphyromonas gingivalis, its lipopolysaccharide (lps), or gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) further increased nitric oxide levels and apoptosis. escherichia coli and streptococcus mutans induced lesser effects. gingival fibroblasts and neutrophils responded to  a lesser degree to these stimuli, whereas keratinocytes were resistant to apoptosis. thus, proapoptotic matrices trigger nitric oxide release via jnk-1, promoting further apoptosis in host cells. lps and ifn-gamma accentuate this mechanism, suggesting that during inflammation, the affected matrices and bacterial and inflammatory components combined exert a greater pathogenic effect  on host cells.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

TI  == novel anti-microbial therapies for dental plaque-related diseases.
AB  == control of dental plaque-related diseases has traditionally relied on non-specific removal of plaque by mechanical means. as our knowledge of oral disease mechanisms increases, future treatment is likely to be more targeted, for example at small groups of organisms, single species or at key virulence factors  they produce. the aim of this review is to consider the current status as regards novel treatment approaches. maintenance of oral hygiene often includes use of chemical agents; however, increasing problems of resistance to synthetic antimicrobials have encouraged the search for alternative natural products. plants are the source of more than 25% of prescription and over-the-counter preparations, and the potential of natural agents for oral prophylaxis will therefore be considered. targeted approaches may be directed at the black-pigmented anaerobes associated with periodontitis. such pigments provide an opportunity for targeted phototherapy with high-intensity monochromatic light. studies to date have demonstrated selective killing of porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in biofilms. functional inhibition approaches, including the use of protease inhibitors, are also being explored to control periodontitis. replacement therapy by which a resident pathogen is replaced with  a non-pathogenic bacteriocin-producing variant is currently under development with respect to streptococcus mutans and dental caries.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == potential oral health benefits of cranberry.
AB  == in the past decade, cranberry extracts have been attracting ever-growing attention by dental researchers. the potential benefits of cranberry components in reducing oral diseases, including dental caries and periodontitis, are discussed in this review. a non-dialysable cranberry fraction enriched in high molecular weight polyphenols has very promising properties with respect to cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria, as well as to the host inflammatory response and enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. cranberry components  are potential anti-caries agents since they inhibit acid production, attachment,  and biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans. glucan-binding proteins, extracellular enzymes, carbohydrate production, and bacterial hydrophobicity, are all affected by cranberry components. regarding periodontal diseases, the same cranberry fraction inhibits host inflammatory responses, production, and activity of enzymes that cause the destruction of the extracellular matrix, biofilm formation, and adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis, and proteolytic activities  and coaggregation of periodontopathogens. the above-listed effects suggest that cranberry components, especially those with high molecular weight, could serve as bioactive molecules for the prevention and/or treatment of oral diseases.

TI  == a porphyromonas gingivalis tyrosine phosphatase is a multifunctional regulator of virulence attributes.
AB  == low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatases (lmwtp) are widespread in prokaryotes; however, understanding of the signalling cascades controlled by these enzymes is  still emerging. porphyromonas gingivalis, an opportunistic oral pathogen, expresses a lmwtp, ltp1, that is differentially regulated in biofilm communities. here we characterize the enzymatic activity of ltp1 and, through the use of mutants that lack ltp1 or expresses catalytically defective ltp1, show that tyrosine phosphatase activity constrains both monospecies biofilm development and community development with the antecedent oral biofilm constituent streptococcus  gordonii. exopolysaccharide production is downregulated by ltp1 through transcriptional regulation of multiple genes involved in biosynthesis and transport. furthermore, ltp1 regulates transcriptional activity of luxs and thus  impacts ai-2-dependent signalling in biofilm communities. in the absence of ltp1  transcription across the hmu haemin uptake locus is reduced, and consequently uptake of haemin is impaired in the ltp1 mutant. the gingipain proteinases kgp and rgpa/b remain phosphorylated in the ltp1 mutant. phosphorylated rgps are poorly secreted, whereas cell surface activity of phosphorylated kgp is enhanced. by controlling the activity of several virulence-associated properties, ltp1 may  restrain the pathogenic potential of p. gingivalis and maintain a commensal interaction with the host.

AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with oral streptococci requires a motif that resembles the eukaryotic nuclear receptor box protein-protein interaction domain.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis initially colonizes the oral cavity by interacting with  organisms in supragingival plaque, such as the oralis group of oral streptococci. this interaction involves the association of the streptococcal antigen i/ii with  the minor fimbrial antigen (mfa1) of p. gingivalis. our previous studies showed that a peptide (bar) derived from antigen i/ii inhibits p. gingivalis adherence and subsequent biofilm formation on streptococcal substrates. in addition, screening a combinatorial peptide library identified select amino acid substitutions in the nitvk active region of bar that increased the adherence of p. gingivalis to streptococci. here we report that incorporating these residues in a synthetic peptide results in more-potent inhibition of p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation (i(50) [50% inhibition] at 0.52 microm versus i(50) at 1.25 microm for bar). in addition, a second structural motif in bar, comprised of the amino acids kkvqdllkk, was shown to contribute to p. gingivalis  adherence to streptococci. consistent with this, the kkvqdllkk and nitvk motifs are conserved only in antigen i/ii proteins expressed by the oralis group of streptococci, which interact with p. gingivalis. interestingly, the primary and secondary structures and the functional characteristics of the amphipathic vqdll  core alpha-helix resemble the consensus nuclear receptor (nr) box protein-protein interacting domain sequence (lxxll) of eukaryotes. bar peptides containing amino  acid substitutions with the potential to disrupt the secondary structure of vqdll were less-effective inhibitors of p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation,  suggesting that the alpha-helical character of vqdll is important. furthermore, replacing the lysines that flank vqdll with acidic amino acids also reduced inhibitory activity, suggesting that the association of vqdll with mfa1 may be stabilized by a charge clamp. these results indicate that the mfa1-interacting interface of streptococcal antigen i/ii encompasses both the kkvqdllkk and nitvk  motif and suggest that the adherence of p. gingivalis to streptococci is driven by a protein-protein interaction domain that resembles the eukaryotic nr box. thus, both motifs must be taken into account in designing potential peptidomimetics that target p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation.

TI  == predominant bacteria recovered from a periodontitis site in a hamster model raised by silk-ligature with porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  == we isolated oral bacteria that coexisted with porphyromonas gingivalis in a hamster periodontitis model. as predominant bacteria in the periodontitis site, collinsella-reltaed strains, eubacterium-reltaed strains, streptococcus suis-related strains, and veillonella parvula-reltaed strains were detected. in addition, actinomyces, bacteroides, and p. gingivalis were also isolated predominantly. the results suggest that the bacterial composition of the periodontitis site in hamsters is complex, as in human periodontitis.

TI  == analysis of the activity to induce toll-like receptor (tlr)2- and tlr4-mediated stimulation of supragingival plaque.
AB  == background: the deleterious effects of the accumulation of supragingival plaque are well known, but the role of the proinflammatory property of supragingival plaque in periodontal diseases has not been completely elucidated. the aim of this study was to determine the relevance of toll-like receptor (tlr)2- and tlr4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque to periodontal parameters. methods: we isolated 144 supragingival plaque samples and analyzed tlr2- and tlr4-stimulating activity using genetically engineered chinese hamster ovary reporter cells that express a reporter molecule upon activation of nuclear factor-kappa b through tlr2 or tlr4. the numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans cells in each plaque sample were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: the activity to induce tlr4-mediated stimulation, but not tlr2-mediated stimulation, was positively associated with the plaque score and bleeding on probing score of the  teeth from which the plaque samples were taken. the activity to induce tlr2-mediated stimulation, but not tlr4-mediated stimulation, was negatively associated with probing depth and clinical attachment level. the ratio of tlr4-/tlr2-mediated stimulation was positively associated with all of those parameters. the number of p. gingivalis cells in each plaque sample was associated with the plaque score and clinical attachment level, but no strong association was observed between the ratio of examined bacteria in each plaque sample and the activity to induce tlr2- or tlr4-mediated stimulation, except for  a weak correlation between the ratio of a. actinomycetemcomitans cells and the activity to induce tlr4-mediated stimulation. conclusion: the tlr2- and tlr4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque is associated with clinical parameters for gingivitis and periodontitis.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == antimicrobial effect and ph of chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide alone and  associated with other materials.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate gel, calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] and their combination with iodoform and zinc oxide powder as intracanal medications against select microorganisms, and to measure the ph changes caused by these medications. antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. the zones of  growth inhibition were measured and the results were analyzed statistically by kruskal-wallis test (p<0.05). the ph of the pastes was measured right after preparation, after 24 h and 1 week later. the largest mean zones of microbial inhibition were produced by 2% chx gel, followed by ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + iodoform, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + zinc oxide, and ca(oh)2 +  water. the mean ph of all medications stayed above 12.0 during the whole experiment, except for chx gel (ph=7.0). the results of this study showed that all medications had antimicrobial activity, but the most effective against the tested microorganisms were 2% chx gel, followed by its combination with ca(oh)2 and iodoform.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.

TI  == interactions between salivary bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  == coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. bifidobacterium adolescentis olb6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii jcm8350, streptococcus mitis ols3293, streptococcus sanguinis jcm5708, veillonella parvula atcc17745 or porphyromonas gingivalis ob7124, but it did coaggregate with fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using fish revealed that b. adolescentis olb6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. it did, however, adhere to biofilms of a. naeslundii, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with a. naeslundii nor with v.  parvula. these results suggest that the adhesion of b. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. heat- or proteinase k-treated f. nucleatum could not coaggregate with b. adolescentis. similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase k-treated b. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. it is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of b. adolescentis and f. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. the data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == transcutaneous immunization with an outer membrane protein of porphyromonas gingivalis without adjuvant elicits marked antibody responses.
AB  == background/aims: we have previously reported that specific immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies induced by transcutaneous immunization (tci) with a 40-kda outer membrane protein (40k-omp) of porphyromonas gingivalis, with cholera toxin (ct) as adjuvant, inhibited coaggregation by p. gingivalis. in this study, we further  pursue the potential of the 40k-omp as a transcutaneous vaccine. methods/results: tci of rats administered 40k-omp elicited significant 40k-omp-specific serum igg  and iga, as well as salivary igg antibody titers. importantly, these antibody responses were induced without adjuvant. thus, both serum and saliva antibody titers induced by tci with the 40k-omp alone were identical to those of 40k-omp plus cholera toxin as adjuvant. the serum antibody responses induced by 40k-omp persisted for more than 140 days. on the other hand, salivary igg anti-40k-omp antibodies were gradually decreased. analysis of antibody-forming cells (afcs) confirmed the antibody titers by detecting high numbers of 40k-omp-specific igg afcs in spleen and cervical lymph node. conclusion: since 40k-omp-specific igg inhibited the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with streptococcus gordonii, and the hemagglutinin activity of p. gingivalis, tci with the 40k-omp may be important as an adjuvant-free immunogen for the prevention of chronic periodontitis.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == susceptibility to various oral antiseptics of porphyromonas gingivalis w83 within a biofilm.
AB  == the origin of chronic periodontal disease is strongly related to the nature and physiology of the subgingival bacterial biofilm, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is a main protagonist. this study was conducted in vitro, to test the  susceptibility of the w83 strain of p gingivalis to several oral antiseptics, bearing in mind its mode of growth as biofilm. to this end, the investigators inoculated a brain-heart infusion broth with streptococcus gordonii, to which p gingivalis was added before perfusion for 7 d via a closed circuit containing a modified robbins device. then, various antiseptics were perfused through the circuit over 30 min, and their bactericidal effects were evaluated after culture  by comparison of the mean proportion of bacteria killed. the average proportion of p gingivalis w83 killed after 15 min of contact with antiseptics was 90.51% (+/-4.78) for chlorhexidine 0.2%, 89.87% (+/-6.58) for povidone-iodine 1%, and 98.6% (+/-0.86) for listerine (mcneil-ppc, inc., morris plains, nj). after 30 min of contact, survival of p gingivalis was nil, irrespective of the antimicrobial agent used. preliminary results show that antiseptic mouth rinses, when used in pure concentrations in the traditional way, are effective in killing p gingivalis w83 within a biofilm. furthermore, in light of these experiments, it appears that the best results are obtained when listerine is used; however, new trials should  be conducted to confirm this observation.

TI  == effects of 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid and its ester derivatives on biofilm formation by two oral pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid, active principle isolated from acronychia baueri schott, and its ester derivatives on biofilm formation by two important oral pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans. the parent acid and conjugates with vanillic acid, 2-hydroxynaphthoquinone and guaiacol caused a significant and reproducible inhibition of p. gingivalis biofilm formation. this effect could be related to the ability of the compounds to inhibit bacterial growth. these compounds also efficiently caused a reduction of biofilm formation by s. mutans, a phenomenon not related to growth inhibition. these data suggest that 3-(4'-geranyloxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-2-trans propenoic acid and some of its ester derivatives may have a therapeutic/preventive potential for oral infections.

TI  == analysis of the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used for dental analgesia.
AB  == seven local anaesthetics and their active anaesthetic components [ultracaine d-s  (articaine hydrochloride), carbostesin (bupivacaine hydrochloride), scandicaine (mepivacaine hydrochloride), xylonest (prilocaine hydrochloride), xylocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride), hostacaine (butanilicaine phosphate) and novocaine (procaine hydrochloride)] were tested for their antimicrobial activity against 311 bacterial strains from 52 different species and 14 candida albicans strains.  the tested pathogens were members of the oral flora, and partly members of the skin and intestinal flora. additionally, the antimicrobial activity of methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, sodium disulfite, adrenaline hydrogen tartrate and adrenaline (the preservative and vasoconstrictive components of the anaesthetics) was tested. for determination of mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), the agar dilution method using wilkins-chalgren agar was applied. the trade preparation ultracaine d-s showed the most prominent antimicrobial activity with regard to both mic and mbc. ultracaine d-s and its active substance, articaine hydrochloride, showed similar mic values, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity is mainly caused by the anaesthetic component. novocaine showed the lowest antimicrobial activity and did not inhibit 35 of the species tested. the mic values of all local anaesthetics were between 0.25 and 16 mg ml(-1). the routinely applied concentration of ultracaine d-s was roughly four times higher, and of hostacaine was two times higher, than the mbc values for the tested bacteria, whereas for the other anaesthetics, the mbc values were not reached or exceeded with the concentrations used. the mic range of the preservatives was 0.5-1.0 mg ml(-1) for methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and 0.2-0.5 mg ml(-1) for sodium disulfite. the articaine mic values were two to three serial dilution steps lower, and the butanilicaine mic values one to two serial dilution steps lower, than the mic of the preservatives. the mepivacaine mean mic values were slightly lower for fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and staphylococcus aureus, but higher for streptococcus  intermedius, compared with the preservative methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. the same result was found with streptococcus intermedius and lidocaine. screening of 20 mic values of 4 pure anaesthetic substances and the corresponding preservative found 2/20 instances where the mics of the preservatives against 5 representative species (67 strains) were lower, indicating that the antimicrobial effect was mainly due to the preservative, but 18/20 results where the pure anaesthetic component showed greater antimicrobial effects compared with the preservative. the in vitro results for carbostesin, scandicaine and especially for novocaine indicate that a local disinfection should be done prior to injection of the anaesthetics. due to the results obtained with nosocomial strains (escherichia coli, s. aureus and pseudomonas), disinfection of the mucous membranes should be  performed routinely in immunocompromised patients, regardless of the anaesthetic  used.

AB  == clp proteases and chaperones are ubiquitous among prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and in many pathogenic bacteria the clp stress response system is also involved in regulation of virulence properties. in this study, the roles of clpb, clpc, and clpxp in stress resistance, homotypic and heterotypic biofilm formation, and intracellular invasion in the oral opportunistic pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. absence of clpc and clpxp, but not clpb, resulted in diminished tolerance to high temperatures. response to oxidative stress was not affected by the loss of any of the clp proteins. the clpc and clpxp mutants demonstrated elevated monospecies biofilm formation, and the absence of clpxp also enhanced heterotypic p. gingivalis-streptococcus gordonii biofilm formation. all clp mutants adhered to gingival epithelial cells to the same level as the wild type; however, clpc and clpxp were found to be necessary for entry into host epithelial cells. clpb did not play a role in entry but was required for intracellular replication and survival. clpxp negatively regulated the surface exposure of the minor fimbrial (mfa) protein subunit of p. gingivalis, which stimulates biofilm formation but interferes with epithelial cell entry. collectively, these results show that the clp protease complex and chaperones control several processes that are important for the colonization and survival of p. gingivalis in the oral cavity.

TI  == effect of tissue fluids on hydrophobicity and adherence of enterococcus faecalis  to dentin.
AB  == this in vitro study was carried out to determine (1) the hydrophobicity of selected oral bacteria, (2) the influence of growth media (saliva and serum) and  mode of growth (planktonic or biofilm) on the hydrophobicity of enterococcus faecalis, and (3) the influence of growth media and conditioning fluids on the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the ability to bind to a hydrocarbon phase (xylene) was used as an index of relative hydrophobicity of cells. fluorescent microscopy-based technique was used to assay the bacterial adherence to dentin. results showed that bacteria involved in the primary stage of oral biofilm formation such as streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis are relatively more hydrophobic than e. faecalis. the hydrophobicity of e. faecalis was significantly increased during starvation and biofilm mode of growth (p < .05). the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin was appreciably increased after starvation and when dentin was conditioned with saliva. it was observed that surface conditioning of dentin with saliva and starvation can enhance the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the findings from  this study indicated that the coronal leakage of saliva and the physiologic state of microbes might play an important role in the adherence and biofilm formation of bacteria to root canal dentin.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis and the autophagic pathway: an innate immune interaction?
AB  == autophagy is a mechanism used to maintain several intracellular functions essential to eukaryotic cells. recently, a role for autophagy in innate and adaptive immunity has also been established including the elimination of invading bacteria. although some intracellular pathogens are killed by autophagy, several  others subvert autophagy to the pathogen's benefit for survival and replication.  porphyromonas gingivalis, an important periodontal pathogen, has been shown to stimulate autophagy in endothelial cells and to use the autophagic pathway to its advantage. in human coronary artery endothelial cells (hcaec), p. gingivalis localizes within autophagosomes. after intracellular uptake, p. gingivalis transits from early autophagosomes to late autophagosomes and prevents the formation of autolysosomes, either by delaying the autophagosome-lysosome fusion  or by redirecting the normal autophagic trafficking. in addition, p. gingivalis was also found to stimulate autophagy in human aortic endothelial cells (haec) since co-localization of lc3-ii, an autophagosome marker, with p. gingivalis was  observed. the trafficking of p. gingivalis into the autophagic pathway appears to be dependent upon the host cell type. survival of p. gingivalis through the subversion of the host autophagic pathway can be considered a bacterial strategy  to evade the innate immune system and persist in the host.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to examine the diversity of bacterial  species in the infected root canals of teeth associated with endodontic abscesses by cloning and sequencing techniques in concert with denaturing high-performance  liquid chromatography. methods: samples collected from five infected root canals  were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with universal 16s ribosomal dna primers. products of these pcrs were cloned and sequenced. denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) was used as a screening method to  reduce the number of clones necessary for dna sequencing. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria and a range of 7-13 different bacteria were found per root canal sample. in total, 48 different oral clones were detected among the five root canal samples. olsenella profusa was the only species present in all samples. porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, dialister invisus, lachnospiraceae oral clone, staphylococcus aureus, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, peptostreptococcus micros and enterococcus faecalis were found in two of the five samples. the majority of the taxa were present in only one sample, for example tannerella forsythia, shuttleworthia satelles and filifactor alocis. some facultative anaerobes that are frequently isolated from endodontic infections such as e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus  and lactobacillus spp. were also found in this study. conclusion: clonal analysis of the microflora associated with endodontic infections revealed a wide diversity of oral species.

TI  == compressed mints and chewing gum containing magnolia bark extract are effective against bacteria responsible for oral malodor.
AB  == flavors and natural botanic extracts are often used in chewing gum and compressed mints for breath freshening and relief of oral malodor. the oral malodor is a result of bacterial putrification of proteinaceous materials from food or saliva. in this study, magnolia bark extract (mbe) and its two main components, magnolol  and honokiol, were evaluated by the minimum inhibition concentration (mic) test.  the inhibitory effect of mbe mint was further evaluated by a kill-time assay study. in addition, an in vivo study was performed on nine healthy volunteers postlunch. saliva samples were taken before and after subjects consumed mints and gum, with and without mbe. listerine mouthwash was included as a positive control. the testing results indicated that mbe and its two main constituents demonstrated a strong germ-kill effect against bacteria responsible for halitosis and also streptococcus mutans, bacteria involved in dental caries formation. the  mic of magnolol, honokiol, and mbe on porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and s. mutans ranged from 8 to 31 microg/ml. kill-time assay results indicated that mints containing 0.2% mbe reduced more than 99.9% of three oral bacteria within 5 min of treatment. the in vivo study demonstrated that mbe containing mints reduced total salivary bacteria by 61.6% at 30 min and 33.8% at  60 min postconsumption. in comparison, the flavorless mint reduced total salivary bacteria by 3.6% at 30 min and increased total bacteria by 47.9% at 60 min. the mbe containing chewing gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 43.0% at 40 min, while placebo gum reduced total salivary bacteria by 18.0%. in conclusion, mbe demonstrated a significant antibacterial activity against organisms responsible for oral malodor and can be incorporated in compressed mints and chewing gum for  improved breath-freshening benefits.

TI  == identification of a signalling molecule involved in bacterial intergeneric communication.
AB  == the development of complex multispecies communities such as biofilms is controlled by interbacterial communication systems. we have previously reported an intergeneric communication between two oral bacteria, streptococcus cristatus  and porphyromonas gingivalis, that results in inhibition of fima expression. here, we demonstrate that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (arca), of s. cristatus serves as a signal that initiates intergeneric communication. an arca-deficient mutant of s. cristatus is unable to communicate with p. gingivalis. furthermore, arginase activity is not essential for the communication, and arca retains the ability to repress expression of fima in the  presence of arginine deiminase inhibitors. these results present a novel mechanism by which intergeneric communication in dental biofilms is accomplished.

TI  == susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms  for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. material and methods: twenty strains  of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and human beta defensin-3. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. results: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to ll-37 than the others (p=0.004). the susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on  the species but not on the strains. the periodontopathic bacteria, especially actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003).  in addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. conclusion: our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some  periodontopathic bacteria.

AB  == objective: down's syndrome (ds) individuals suffer from an increased susceptibility to infections. here, we assessed age-related changes in the salivary-specific humoral immunity of ds subjects. design: parotid and whole saliva were collected from a young group of ds (yds, n=30, 23.3+/-4 years), an older group of ds individuals (ods, n=10, 51.9+/-8 years) and compared to two age-matched groups of healthy volunteers--a young group (yc, n=29, 22.8+/-5 years) and an older group (oc, n=10, 48.4+/-9 years). the levels of total iga, and specific antibodies to three common oral pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans)  were analysed. results: the limited increases in iga concentrations could not compensate the dramatic reduction in the salivary flow rate observed in ds individuals. therefore, the median secretion rates of the specific antibodies in  whole and parotid saliva were 70-77% and 34-60% (respectively) lower in yds individuals as compared to yc and farther 77-100% and 75-88% (respectively) lower in ods compared to yds. in contrast, the antibody secretion rates were similar for parotid saliva, or even increased for whole saliva of oc, compared with yc. consequently, a dramatic cumulative extreme reduction (>92%) in the bacterial specific salivary antibodies differentiated the adult ds individuals from to their age-matched controls. conclusions: our results indicate a severe immunodeficiency in the secretion rate of the specific salivary iga response of in ds individuals which intensifies with age.

TI  == targeted profiling of oral bacteria in human saliva and in vitro biofilms with quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == an in vitro plaque model based on the use of human salivary bacteria and tooth-like surfaces was previously developed for studying the formation of oral biofilm and its use for pre-clinical testing of candidate antimicrobial or antiplaque agents. in this study, a quantitative taqman pcr assay (qpcr) was developed to compare the bacterial compositions of in vitro biofilms to parent saliva samples, and to determine the relative contributions of different species  in the formation of the oral biofilm. in addition, the growth inhibition of saliva-derived plaque was evaluated by chlorhexidine. with this assay, which consisted of primer/probe sets targeting either 16s rdna sequences present in public databases or cloned ribosomal intergenic spacer region (isr) sequences, 15 oral bacteria derived from saliva as well as those that were responsible for biofilm formation in an in vitro plaque model were rapidly identified and quantified. among the target organisms were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, micromonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, tannerella forsythensis, and veillonella parvula. primer and probe sets developed were both sensitive and specific. the relative profiles of a number of bacteria in 45-h-old biofilms were determined and, when compared to saliva samples, it was found that most of the bacteria identified in  saliva also populated the in vitro plaque, including some anaerobes. brief exposure of biofilms to chlorhexidine resulted in significant losses in viability. this new broad spectrum qpcr assay in combination with the in vitro plaque model will be of significant value in the quantitative study of the microbial composition of human saliva, saliva-derived plaque, and pre-clinical evaluation of potential antimicrobial and antiplaque molecules.

TI  == association of a high-molecular weight arginine-binding protein of fusobacterium  nucleatum atcc 10953 with adhesion to secretory immunoglobulin a and coaggregation with streptococcus cristatus.
AB  == introduction: fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregates with a diverse range of bacterial species, and binds to host tissues and proteins such as immunoglobulin. these interactions may support the attachment of a variety of organisms to oral surfaces and can facilitate the invasion of soft tissues. we hypothesized that coaggregation with streptococci and immunoglobulin binding may occur by a common  adhesin sensitive to l-arginine. methods: repeated mixing of f. nucleatum with non-immune secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) and recovery of non-agglutinating cells isolated a spontaneous mutant (isolate 21) of f. nucleatum that was defective in s-iga binding. wild-type and mutant f. nucleatum were compared by coaggregation and adhesion assays. results: isolate 21 exhibited significantly reduced s-iga binding and coaggregation with oral streptococci but not with porphyromonas gingivalis. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the mutant was deficient compared to wild-type for  a single protein of approximately 360 kilodaltons. the corresponding protein was  isolated from wild-type f. nucleatum protein preparations by coprecipitation with arginine-agarose beads. this protein was able to bind both streptococcus cristatus and s-iga. mass spectrometry analysis indicated that this protein was closely related to putative autotransporter proteins in other f. nucleatum strains and was a 100% match to the deduced amino acid sequence of a 10,638-base-pair open reading frame in the incomplete genome sequence of f. nucleatum atcc 10,953. peptides identified by ms-ms analysis spanned most of the  predicted amino acid sequence, suggesting that the mature protein is not subject  to postsecretory cleavage. conclusion: coaggregation represents a novel function  within the autotransporter class of proteins, which are often associated with virulence.

AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == involvement of minor components associated with the fima fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis in adhesive functions.
AB  == the fima fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis, the causative agent of periodontitis, have been implicated in various aspects of pathogenicity, such as  colonization, adhesion and aggregation. in this study, the four open reading frames (orf1, orf2, orf3 and orf4) downstream of the fimbrilin gene (fima) in strain atcc 33277 were examined. orf2, orf3 and orf4 were demonstrated to encode  minor components of the fimbriae and were therefore renamed fimc, fimd and fime,  respectively. immunoblotting analyses revealed that inactivation of either fimc or fimd by an ermf-ermam insertion, but not inactivation of orf1, was accompanied by concomitant loss of the products from the downstream genes, raising the possibility that fimc, fimd and fime constitute a transcription unit. the fime mutant produced fimc and fimd, but fimbriae purified from it contained neither protein, suggesting that fime is required for the assembly of fimc and fimd onto  the fimbrilin (fima) fibre. the fimc, fimd and fime mutants lost autoaggregation  abilities. fimbriae purified from these three mutants showed attenuated binding activities to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of streptococcus oralis and to two extracellular matrix proteins, fibronectin and type i collagen. these  results suggest that fime, as well as fimc and fimd, play critical roles in the adhesive activities of the mature fima fimbriae in p. gingivalis.

TI  == periodontal bacterial dna suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  == certain cpg motifs found in bacterial dna enhance immune responses through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. our objective was to determine if dna from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral  cavity. streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (gtf), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-gtf, or alum-gtf together with either escherichia coli dna, fusobacterium nucleatum dna, or porphyromonas gingivalis dna. contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-gtf plus bacterial dna (p. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody, salivary iga antibody, and t-cell proliferation to gtf compared to animals immunized with alum-gtf alone. a diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-gtf with the p. gingivalis dna either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and dna was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. since tlr triggering by dna induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [socs]), the effects  of p. gingivalis dna and gtf exposure on rat splenocyte production of socs family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. p. gingivalis dna significantly up-regulated socs1 and socs5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. these results suggested that dna from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive socs components triggered by innate mechanisms.

TI  == identification of periodontopathic bacteria in gingival tissue of japanese periodontitis patients.
AB  == introduction: the identification of invading periodontopathic bacteria in tissues is important to determine their role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.  the objective of this study was to identify periodontopathic bacteria in diseased gingival tissue of periodontitis patients. methods: subgingival plaque and gingival tissue were collected from 32 generalized chronic periodontitis (cp), 16 generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and eight localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) patients. detection frequencies and quantities of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythensis were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. the prevalences of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sobrinus were also examined and the distribution of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes was observed. results: p. gingivalis and t. forsythensis were detected in approximately 70% of tissue samples and 50% of plaque samples in the three periodontitis groups. prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in tissue samples was higher in the lagp (63%) group  than in either the cp (16%) or the gagp (38%) group. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c was detected in 50% of lagp patients. detection frequencies of s. oralis and s. sobrinus were markedly low in both plaque and tissue samples from all three periodontitis groups. amounts of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythensis in the tissue samples were not different among the three periodontitis groups. conclusion: p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythensis can localize in diseased gingival tissue and may be involved in periodontal tissue destruction. serotype c is the predominant serotype of a. actinomycetemcomitans in japanese lagp patients.

TI  == surface modification of orthodontic wires with photocatalytic titanium oxide for  its antiadherent and antibacterial properties.
AB  == objective: to test the antiadherent and antibacterial properties of surface modification of orthodontic wires with photocatalytic titanium oxide (tio(2)). materials and methods: tio(2) was coated on the surface of the orthodontic wires  by a sol-gel thin film dip-coating method. bacterial adhesion to the wires was evaluated by the weight change of the wires. the antibacterial activity of the surface-modified orthodontic wires was demonstrated by the dilution agar plate method for streptococcus mutans and spectrophotometry for porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the orthodontic wires coated with the photocatalytic tio(2)  showed an antiadherent effect against s. mutans compared with the uncoated wires. the bacterial mass that bound to the tio(2)-coated orthodontic wires remained unchanged, whereas that of the uncoated wires increased by 4.97%. furthermore, the tio(2)-coated orthodontic wires had a bactericidal effect on s. mutans and p. gingivalis, which cause dental caries and periodontitis, respectively. the antiadherent and antibacterial mechanisms of tio(2) to break down the cell wall of those bacteria were revealed by scanning electron microscopy. conclusion: the  surface modification of orthodontic wires with photocatalytic tio(2) can be used  to prevent the development of dental plaque during orthodontic treatment.

TI  == subgingival plaque microbiota in hiv positive patients.
AB  == aim: to describe and compare the predominant bacterial and fungal species associated with gingivitis, periodontitis, and linear gingival erythema (lge), in hiv positive subjects with different immune status. methods: viral loads and cd4  levels determined hiv disease status. from pooled subgingival plaque, 16s and 18s rdna were cloned and sequenced to determine species identity. results: one hundred and nine bacterial species were identified from 14 subjects. nearly half  of the species were not cultivable. notably, the classical putative periodontal pathogens, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia were below the limit of detection and were not detected. species of gemella, dialister, streptococcus and veillonella were predominant. in one hiv positive subject with periodontitis and low viral load, gemella morbillorum, a known opportunistic pathogen, constituted 84% of the clones. saccharomyces cerevisiae was the only fungal species detected in an lge subject and in periodontitis subjects with high viral loads. in periodontitis patients with low viral loads, candida albicans was predominant, while s. cerevisiae was only a minor component. conclusion: these case studies suggest that other bacterial species, rather than  the classical periodontal pathogens, may be involved in periodontal diseases of subjects with hiv. these data are indicative of opportunistic infections in a highly susceptible immunocompromised host.

TI  == gingival epithelial cell transcriptional responses to commensal and opportunistic oral microbial species.
AB  == transcriptional profiling and ontology tools were utilized to define the biological pathways of gingival epithelial cells modulated by coculture with the  oral commensal streptococcus gordonii and the opportunistic commensal fusobacterium nucleatum. overall, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii perturbed the gingival epithelial cell transcriptome much less significantly than the oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans perturbed the transcriptome, indicating that there was a greater degree of host adaptation by the commensal species (m. handfield, j. j. mans, g. zheng, m. c. lopez, s. mao, a. progulske-fox, g. narasimhan, h. v. baker, and r. j. lamont, cell. microbiol. 7:811-823, 2005). the biological pathways significantly impacted by f. nucleatum and s. gordonii included the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. differential regulation of gadd45 and dusp4, key components of the mapk pathway, was confirmed at the protein level by western blotting. modulation of the mapk pathway is likely to affect host cell proliferation and differentiation. in addition, both the mapk and toll-like receptor pathways ultimately converge on cytokine gene expression.  an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of secreted interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 demonstrated that f. nucleatum induced production of these cytokines, whereas s.  gordonii inhibited secretion from the epithelial cells. stimulation of secretion  of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells may reflect the invasive phenotype of f. nucleatum and contribute to the greater pathogenic potential of f. nucleatum than of s. gordonii.

TI  == evaluation of subgingival bacteria in the dog and susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in italy for treatment of canine infections. of the anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by peptostreptococcus + porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with escherichia coli or pasteurella multocida. resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin  + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics  tested. the emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.

TI  == egg yolk-derived immunoglobulin (igy) against porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kda outer membrane protein inhibits coaggregation activity.
AB  == the anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis, a major pathogen in periodontitis, aggregates with a number of oral bacteria to form dental plaque, which is important for its colonization. we previously cloned the gene coding the 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp) of p. gingivalis 381 and produced large amounts of the recombinant (r) protein. affinity-purified rabbit antiserum against r40-kda omp effectively inhibited the coaggregation activity of p. gingivalis to oral bacteria, thus 40-kda omp was thought to be an important coaggregation factor of p. gingivalis. further, since it is conserved among many  p. gingivalis strains, this coaggregation factor may be an effective target for passive immunotherapy against p. gingivalis infection. recently, passive immunization approaches using a specific antibody produced from hen egg yolk (igy) have been developed for oral infectious diseases, and shown to be convenient and economic. in the present study, we immunized hens intramuscularly  with r40-kda omp and obtained highly purified igy from the egg yolks. the purified igy specifically recognized r40-kda omp and also reacted with a functional coaggregation-associated domain peptide of 40-kda omp. our results demonstrated that a ratio of purified igy as low as 2.5 microg/150 microl significantly inhibited the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with streptococcus gordonii, which was verified by a visual coaggregation assay and radioactivity-based quantitative micro-coaggregation assay. we concluded anti-r40-kda omp igy may be useful for passive immunization against periodontal diseases caused by p. gingivalis infection.

TI  == sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  == aim: to explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (uv) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. methodology: the sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to uv light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm uv, at a fluence of 1-20 mj cm(-2). an experimental model was  designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of uv light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. results: direct exposure to relatively low doses of uv light (2-7 mj cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. furthermore, an enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to uv light (p < 0.001). uv was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. when 4 bacterial  cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the uv light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. conclusions: the application of uv light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the uv light dose adapted accordingly.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius promotes mucin putrefaction and malodor production by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == although the contribution of the oral microbiota to oral malodor is well-documented, the potential role of gram-positive micro-organisms is unclear.  in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that gram-positive micro-organisms contribute to malodor production by deglycosylating oral glycoproteins, rendering them susceptible to subsequent proteolysis. to this end, we examined the effect of streptococcus salivarius on porphyromonas gingivalis-mediated putrefaction of  a model glycoprotein (pig gastric mucin). malodor was scored by two odor judges,  and volatile sulfides were determined with the use of a sulfide monitor. mucin degradation was followed by electrophoresis on sds-page. results showed that the  addition of s. salivarius or beta-galactosidase promoted mucin degradation and concomitant malodor production. addition of glycosidic inhibitors (p-aptg and glucose) inhibited this process. these results suggest that gram-positive micro-organisms such as s. salivarius contribute to oral malodor production by deglycosylating salivary glycoproteins, thus exposing their protein core to further degradation by gram-negative micro-organisms.

TI  == structural characterization of peptide-mediated inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm formation.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a periodontal pathogen whose primary niche is the anaerobic environment of subgingival dental plaque, but initial colonization of the oral cavity is likely to occur on supragingival surfaces that already support robust biofilm communities. our studies have shown that p. gingivalis adheres to  streptococcus gordonii through interaction of the minor fimbrial antigen mfa1 with a specific region of the streptococcal sspb polypeptide (residues 1167 to 1193) designated bar. we show that a synthetic peptide comprising the bar sequence potently inhibits p. gingivalis adherence to s. gordonii (50% inhibitory concentration = 1.3 microm) and prevents the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. however, a retroinverso peptide that possessed the same side chain topology as that of bar was inactive, suggesting that interactions of mfa1 with the peptide backbone of bar are important for binding. a conformationally constrained analog of bar inhibited p. gingivalis adherence and biofilm formation but at a lower specific activity than that of bar. therefore, to further define the structural features of the mfa1-bar interaction, we functionally screened combinatorial libraries of bar in which active site residues (asn1182, thr1184, and val1185) were replaced with each of the 19 common amino acids. peptides containing positively charged amino acids at position 1182 or hydrophobic residues at position 1185 bound p. gingivalis more efficiently than did control peptides containing asn and val at these positions, suggesting that electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may contribute to mfa1-sspb binding. in contrast, replacement of pro or gly at these positions was detrimental to adherence, suggesting that perturbation of the bar secondary structure influences activity.  the net effect of substitutions for thr1184 was less pronounced either positively or negatively than that at the other sites. these results define physicochemical  characteristics of the interacting interface of mfa1 and sspb and suggest that peptides or peptidomimetics with greater specific inhibitory activity than that of bar can be developed. these compounds may represent potential therapeutics that target some of the first molecular interactions that allow p. gingivalis to  colonize the oral cavity.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis genes involved in community development with streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the causative agents of adult periodontitis, develops biofilm microcolonies on substrata of streptococcus gordonii but not on  streptococcus mutans. p. gingivalis genome microarrays were used to identify genes differentially regulated during accretion of p. gingivalis in heterotypic biofilms with s. gordonii. thirty-three genes showed up- or downregulation by array analysis, and differential expression was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr. the functions of the regulated genes were predominantly related to metabolism and energy production. in addition, many of the genes have  no current known function. the roles of two upregulated genes, ftsh (pg0047) encoding an atp-dependent zinc metallopeptidase and ptpa (pg1641) encoding a putative tyrosine phosphatase, were investigated further by mutational analysis.  strains with mutations in these genes developed more abundant biofilms with s. gordonii than the parental strain developed. ftsh and ptpa may thus participate in a regulatory network that constrains p. gingivalis accumulation in heterotypic biofilms. this study provided a global analysis of p. gingivalis transcriptional  responses in an oral microbial community and also provided insight into the regulation of heterotypic biofilm development.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

AB  == objective: oral epithelia function as a microbial barrier and are actively involved in recognizing and responding to bacteria. our goal was to examine a tissue engineered model of buccal epithelium for its response to oral bacteria and proinflammatory cytokines and compare the tissue responses with those of a submerged monolayer cell culture. design: the tissue model was characterized for  keratin and beta-defensin expression. altered expression of beta-defensins was evaluated by rt-pcr after exposure of the apical surface to oral bacteria and after exposure to tnf-alpha in the medium. these were compared to the response in traditional submerged oral epithelial cell culture. results: the buccal model showed expression of differentiation specific keratin 13, hbd1 and hbd3 in the upper half of the tissue; hbd2 was not detected. hbd1 mrna was constitutively expressed, while hbd2 mrna increased 2-fold after exposure of the apical surface  to three oral bacteria tested and hbd3 mrna increased in response to the non-pathogenic bacteria tested. in contrast, hbd2 mrna increased 3-600-fold in response to bacteria in submerged cell culture. hbd2 mrna increased over 100-fold in response to tnf-alpha in the tissue model and 50-fold in submerged cell culture. thus, the tissue model is capable of upregulating hbd2, however, the minimal response to bacteria suggests that the tissue has an effective antimicrobial barrier due to its morphology, differentiation, and defensin expression. conclusions: the oral mucosal model is differentiated, expresses hbd1 and hbd3, and has an intact surface with a functional antimicrobial barrier.

AB  == background: antimicrobial peptides are components of the innate immunity that play an important role in systemic and oral health. objectives: the antibacterial activity of the amphibian-derived k4 -s4(1-15)a antimicrobial peptide was tested  against oral pathogens associated with caries and periodontitis and compared with the activities of the human-derived antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and dhvar4a. methods: growth inhibition of planktonic bacteria was tested using standard microdilution assays. live/dead staining followed by confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm) was used to determine the bactericidal effect of k4 -s4(1-15)a  on streptococcus mutans attached to a glass surface or grown as biofilm. results: the cariogenic species s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus paracasei and actinomyces viscosus were resistant to ll-37 found in the oral cavity. porphyromonas gingivalis was the species most resistant to the three tested peptides. k4 -s4(1-15)a demonstrated the highest activity against the tested planktonic bacteria. in addition, k4 -s4(1-15)a was bactericidal to surface-attached s. mutans as well as to s. mutans biofilms grown in vitro. however, surface attachment increased s. mutans resistance to the antimicrobial peptide. conclusions: our results support growing evidence suggesting the use of  antimicrobial peptides for prevention and treatment of oral disease.

TI  == selective inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis growth by a factor xa inhibitor, dx-9065a.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a causative bacterium of adult periodontitis. however, there is no drug specific for p. gingivalis and for its virulence factor. objectives: the objective of this study was to examine the effects of a new selective inhibitor of activated factor x, dx-9065a, on growth of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria. methods: we incubated p. gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria in the presence or absence of dx-9065a and examined the effect of dx-9065a on bacterial growth and trypsin-like activity in its cultures. we also examined the effects of dx9065a on amidolytic activity of purified trypsin-like proteinases (gingipains rgpa and rgpb), from p. gingivalis and on trypsin-like activity in gingival crevicular fluids from patients with adult periodontitis. results: dx-9065a selectively inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, and its effect on p. gingivalis was bactericidal. trypsin-like proteinase activity was detected  in p. gingivalis, and the activity was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. dx-9065a even inhibited amidolytic activity of rgpa and rgpb from p. gingivalis. furthermore, trypsin-like proteinase activity in gingival crevicular fluids was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. conclusions: dx-9065a inhibits p. gingivalis growth in part through to its ability to inhibit the trypsin-like proteinase activity in p. gingivalis and may be useful for a new drug for treatment of adult periodontitis.

TI  == antimicrobial effect in vitro of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide impregnated  gutta-percha points.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of points containing antiseptics used for temporary obturation in endodontics. points containing calcium hydroxide (roeko and hygienic), and chlorhexidine (roeko) were tested and gutta-percha points served as control (meta dental corp.). the following microorganisms were studied: streptococcus mutans (sm), enterococcus faecalis (ef), staphylococcus aureus (sta), candida albicans (ca), fusobacterium  nucleatum (fn) atcc 25586, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) atcc 33277, and prevotella intermedia (pi) atcc 25611. the experiments were organized in three stages: 1st stage: one point of each kind was placed on agar plates previously seeded with microorganisms. 2nd stage: another group of points was immersed in broth for 24 hours and placed on the seeded agar. samples were then incubated at  37 degrees in the conditions of oxygen and for the time required by each microorganism. the zones of bacterial inhibition around each point were measured. the ph values of the broths were recorded. 3rd stage: the immersion broths were inoculated with suspensions of microorganisms, incubated, seeded on plates by dissemination and incubated. cfu counts were performed. results: points containing chlorhexidine showed inhibition zones with every microorganism in the  1st stage and, in the 2nd stage, with most of the microorganisms studied, except  for fn and pi. calcium hydroxide containing points did not inhibit any of the microorganisms assessed. broth ph values did not exhibit any changes. cfu counts  of the broths in which chlorhexidine points had been immersed showed total inhibition for all the microorganisms. the differences between materials were statistically significant (p<0.05) (anova). in the conditions of this study, chlorhexidine-containing points proved to be effective against most of the tested strains.

TI  == role of the porphyromonas gingivalis inlj protein in homotypic and heterotypic biofilm development.
AB  == the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis expresses a homolog of the internalin  family protein inlj. inactivation of inlj reduced monospecies biofilm formation by p. gingivalis. in contrast, heterotypic p. gingivalis-streptococcus gordonii biofilm formation was enhanced in the inlj-deficient mutant. the results indicate a nuanced role for inlj in regulating biofilm accumulations of p. gingivalis.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == effect of muc7 peptides on the growth of bacteria and on streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the susceptibility of selected bacteria as well as streptococcus mutans biofilm to muc7 peptides and compare the activities with those of other known antimicrobial peptides. methods: mic and mbc of peptides for s. mutans, escherichia coli, streptococcus gordonii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using the microdilution method. for s. mutans, the effects of the peptides on the kinetics of growth inhibition, time-killing, and on biofilm formation and reduction were also examined. for biofilm studies, polystyrene microtitre plates, calgary biofilm device (cbd) and hydroxylapatite (ha) discs, along with crystal violet and alamar blue dyes, and/or em observations, were employed. results: s. mutans was the most susceptible to all peptides tested (mics of 9.4-25.0 microm), compared with the other species (mics of 3.1->100 microm). muc7 peptides (except muc7-12-mer-l4) exerted 2-fold higher activity against s. mutans than hsn5-12-mer and magainin-ii, and faster killing of s. mutans than hsn5-12-mer. the muc7 peptides also had an effect on s. mutans biofilm. on the polystyrene plates, they suppressed the biofilm formation, with mbic(50) of 6.25-12.5 microm, and reduced the 1 day developed biofilm in a batch  culture, with mbrc(50) of 25-50 microm. on the cbd pegs, the viabilities of the biofilm were suppressed by >95% in the presence of muc7 peptides at 4x mic (50 microm). one day developed biofilm viabilities were inhibited by 49-75%. on ha, the formation of biofilm (as observed by em) was also considerably reduced. conclusions: muc7 peptides present somewhat preferential antimicrobial activity against s. mutans. they also have an effect on in vitro formation and reduction of the preformed s. mutans biofilm.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

TI  == streptococcus gordonii utilizes several distinct gene functions to recruit porphyromonas gingivalis into a mixed community.
AB  == dental plaque biofilm formation proceeds through a developmental pathway initiated by the attachment of pioneer organisms, such as streptococcus gordonii, to tooth surfaces. through a variety of synergistic interactions, pioneer organisms facilitate the colonization of later arrivals including porphyromonas gingivalis, a potential periodontal pathogen. we have investigated genes of s. gordonii required to support a heterotypic biofilm community with p. gingivalis.  by screening a plasmid integration library of s. gordonii, genes were identified  that are crucial for the accumulation of planktonic p. gingivalis cells into a multispecies biofilm. these genes were further investigated by specific mutation  and complementation analyses. the biofilm-associated genes can be grouped into broad categories based on putative function as follows: (i) intercellular or intracellular signalling (cbe and spxb), (ii) cell wall integrity and maintenance of adhesive proteins (mure, msra and atf), (iii) extracellular capsule biosynthesis (pgsa and atf), and (iv) physiology (gdha, ccma and ntpb). in addition, a gene for a hypothetical protein was identified. biofilm visualization and quantification by confocal microscopy confirmed the role of these genes in the maturation of the multispecies community, including biofilm architectural development. the results suggest that s. gordonii governs the development of heterotypic oral biofilms through multiple genetic pathways.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

TI  == effect of a stannous fluoride dentifrice on the sulcular microbiota: a prospective cohort study in subjects with various levels of periodontal inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  == studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) sampling methods. the purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and gcf samples using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. a total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. the mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (sd+/-4.7). on average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (sd+/-2.9). the  proportion of streptococcus oralis (p<0.02) and fusobacterium periodonticum (p<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). the gcf samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). the proportions of tannerella forsythia (t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola were both higher in gcf samples (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). the microbial  composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of porphyromonas gingivalis. a combination of gcf and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == involvement of periodontopathic anaerobes in aspiration pneumonia.
AB  == increasing evidence has linked the anaerobic bacteria forming periodontopathic biofilms with aspiration pneumonia in elderly persons. in experiments designed to eliminate the potent respiratory pathogens forming biofilms in the oral cavity, we have shown that the mechanical and chemical oral cleansing using povidone-iodine effectively reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae in patients scheduled to undergo oral surgery requiring endotracheal intubation. we confirmed the pathogenicity of periodontopathic anaerobic bacteria for aspiration pneumonia in an experimental mouse model. based upon the finding of the coexistence of porphyromonas gingivalis with treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis lesions, we innoculated a mixed culture of p.  gingivalis and t. denticola into the mouse trachea; the resulting infection induced inflammatory cytokine production and caused pneumonia. in another series  of investigations, professional oral health care (pohc), mainly cleansing administered by dental hygienists once a week for 24 months to elderly persons requiring daily care, resulted in the reduction of the number of total anaerobes, candida albicans, and staphylococcus species and in the number of cases of fatal  aspiration pneumonia. we also found that the pohc treatment of elderly persons for 6 months in the winter season reduced the salivary levels of protease, trypsin-like activity, and neuraminidase and also decreased the frequency of influenza cases.

AB  == objectives: to assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. design: lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. the agar dilution method of the nccls was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of  20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. mic was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. slight growth was defined as  marked growth reduction (mgr). the e-test was used to determine the mics of tetracycline and penicillin-g for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-mic of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). results: eighteen strains (55%) were  sensitive to the extracts (mics 5-20 mg/ml). most of these were periodontal pathogens with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (mic 5-10mg/ml). veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. except for lactobacillus acidophilus that showed mgr at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. the extracts were active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic 10-20 mg/ml) but not against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. the presence of the khat extracts at  a sub-mic resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. conclusions: khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. there is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. further investigation is needed to identify the active components and  assess their clinical relevance.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == comparative study between the effects of photodynamic therapy and conventional therapy on microbial reduction in ligature-induced peri-implantitis in dogs.
AB  == background: progressive peri-implant bone losses, which are accompanied by inflammatory lesions in the soft tissues, are referred to as peri-implantitis. the aim of this study was to compare the effects of photodynamic therapy (pdt) and conventional technique on microbial reduction in ligature-induced peri-implantitis in dogs. methods: eighteen third premolars from nine labrador retriever dogs were extracted and the implants were submerged. after osseointegration, peri-implantitis was induced. after 4 months, ligature was removed and natural bacterial plaque was allowed to form for another 4 months. the animals were then randomly divided into two groups. in the conventional group, they were treated using mucoperiosteal flaps for scaling the implant surface and chlorexidine (conventional) irrigation. in the pdt group, only mucoperiosteal scaling was carried out before photodynamic therapy. inside the peri-implant pocket, a paste-based azulene photosensitizer was placed and then a  gaalas low-power laser (lambda=660 nm, p=40 mw, e=7.2 j for 3 minutes) was used.  microbiological samples were obtained before and immediately after treatment. before treatment, one implant was removed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy to validate the contamination. results: the results of this study showed that prevotella sp., fusobacterium sp., and s. beta-haemolyticus were significantly reduced for both groups. after treatment, no significant differences were observed between the groups. conclusion: these findings suggest  that photodynamic therapy is a non-invasive method that could be used to reduce microorganisms in peri-implantitis.

TI  == identification of candidate periodontal pathogens and beneficial species by quantitative 16s clonal analysis.
AB  == most studies of the bacterial etiology of periodontitis have used either culture-based or targeted dna approaches, and so it is likely that pathogens remain undiscovered. the purpose of this study was to use culture-independent, quantitative analysis of biofilms associated with chronic periodontitis and periodontal health to identify pathogens and beneficial species. samples from subjects with periodontitis and controls were analyzed using ribosomal 16s cloning and sequencing. several genera, many of them uncultivated, were associated with periodontitis, the most numerous of which were gram positive, including peptostreptococcus and filifactor. the genera megasphaera and desulfobulbus were elevated in periodontitis, and the levels of several species or phylotypes of campylobacter, selenomonas, deferribacteres, dialister, catonella, tannerella, streptococcus, atopobium, eubacterium, and treponema were  elevated in disease. streptococcus and veillonella spp. were found in high numbers in all samples and accounted for a significantly greater fraction of the  microbial community in healthy subjects than in those with periodontitis. the microbial profile of periodontal health also included the less-abundant genera campylobacter, abiotrophia, gemella, capnocytophaga, and neisseria. these newly identified candidates outnumbered porphyromonas gingivalis and other species previously implicated as periodontopathogens, and it is not clear if newly identified and more numerous species may play a more important role in pathogenesis. finally, more differences were found in the bacterial profile between subjects with periodontitis and healthy subjects than between deep and shallow sites within the same subject. this suggests that chronic periodontitis is the result of a global perturbation of the oral bacterial ecology rather than  a disease-site specific microbial shift.

TI  == interactions of oral pathogens with toll-like receptors: possible role in atherosclerosis.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlr) function as important signal transducers that mediate innate immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens through pattern recognition of virulence molecules. although tlrs mediate protection against infection, it is also likely that they may have a pathophysiologic role in certain inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis. in atherosclerotic lesions, endothelial cells  and macrophages have been shown to upregulate tlr expression and may respond to tlr agonists of microbial origin, resulting in detrimental inflammatory reactions. some of these potential tlr-activating virulence factors may be of oral origin. the detection in atherosclerotic plaques of dna specific for porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontal pathogens suggests that these pathogens disseminate into the systemic circulation and localize in atheromas. the potential of periodontal and some other oral pathogens to activate tlrs in vivo is suggested by findings from cell culture experiments on interactions of selected virulence protein adhesins with tlrs and their coreceptors. specifically, we have shown that proinflammatory cytokine induction by p. gingivalis fimbriae was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to tlr2, tlr4, cd14, and beta2 integrins, but not by immunoglobulin isotype controls. cytokine induction by bacteroides forsythus protein a depended heavily on cd14 and tlr2. we also found that the ability of streptococcus mutans protein agi/ii to stimulate cytokine release was partially dependent on cd14 and tlr4. moreover, p. gingivalis fimbriae induced tlr-dependent activation of nuclear factor-kappab and upregulation of costimulatory molecules in monocytic cells. these proinflammatory activities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, and similar inflammatory mechanisms could potentially operate in atherosclerosis. studies by  other groups have shown that p. gingivalis is capable of stimulating low-density  lipoprotein oxidation, foam cell formation, and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque through induction of matrix metalloproteinases. interestingly, at least some of these activities can be induced by tlr agonists (lipopolysaccharide and heat-shock protein-60) from chlamydia pneumoniae, a major risk factor in atherosclerosis. future research in animal models and in vitro cellular systems with defined mutations in tlrs may implicate tlr participation in oral pathogen-mediated atherosclerotic processes, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for the epidemiological findings linking oral pathogens to atherosclerotic  disease.

TI  == the bioinformatics resource for oral pathogens.
AB  == complete genomic sequences of several oral pathogens have been deciphered and multiple sources of independently annotated data are available for the same genomes. different gene identification schemes and functional annotation methods  used in these databases present a challenge for cross-referencing and the efficient use of the data. the bioinformatics resource for oral pathogens (brop)  aims to integrate bioinformatics data from multiple sources for easy comparison,  analysis and data-mining through specially designed software interfaces. currently, databases and tools provided by brop include: (i) a graphical genome viewer (genome viewer) that allows side-by-side visual comparison of independently annotated datasets for the same genome; (ii) a pipeline of automatic data-mining algorithms to keep the genome annotation always up-to-date; (iii) comparative genomic tools such as genome-wide orf alignment (goal); and (iv) the oral pathogen microarray database. brop can also handle unfinished genomic sequences and provides secure yet flexible control over data access. the  concept of providing an integrated source of genomic data, as well as the data-mining model used in brop can be applied to other organisms. brop can be publicly accessed at http://www.brop.org.

TI  == short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis and their role in coadhesion with streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, one of the causative agents of adult periodontitis, attaches and forms biofilms on substrata of streptococcus gordonii. coadhesion and biofilm development between these organisms requires the interaction of the short fimbriae of p. gingivalis with the sspb streptococcal surface polypeptide.  in this study we investigated the structure and binding activities of the short fimbriae of p. gingivalis. electron microscopy showed that isolated short fimbriae have an average length of 103 nm and exhibit a helical structure with a  pitch of ca. 27 nm. mfa1, the major protein subunit of the short fimbriae, bound  to sspb protein, and this reaction was inhibited by purified recombinant mfa1 and monospecifc anti-mfa1 serum in a dose-dependent manner. complementation of a polar mfa1 mutant with the mfa1 gene restored the coadhesion phenotype of p. gingivalis. hence, the mfa1 structural fimbrial subunit does not require accessory proteins for binding to sspb. furthermore, the interaction of mfa1 with sspb is necessary for optimal coadhesion between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii.

TI  == fiber optic fluorescence microprobe for endodontic diagnosis.
AB  == successful endodontic therapy requires total debridement as well as complete obturation of the root canal to the cemento-dentinal junction. the goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy for the detection and localization of pathological dentin, pulpal remnants, and microorganisms within the root canal. specific aims were to identify: 1) characteristic excitation/emission spectra for healthy dentin, decayed dentin, enamel, and pulp; 2) the potential of specific spectral data for  differentiating between these tissues; and 3) the potential of spectral data for  detecting the presence and identifying four common endodontic pathogens. fluorescence spectra were determined in the tissues of permanent human teeth, extirpated healthy and necrotic pulps, and four endodontic pathogens. excitation/emission spectra were collected at 366 nm, 405 nm, and 440 nm excitation. marked differences in spectral signatures between the different tissues under investigation were observed. we postulate that the differences in fluorescence spectra of decayed vs. healthy dentin are due to the loss of mineralized tissue components and increased organic presence and water in these tissues. pulpal tissue showed distinctly different fluorescence spectra from healthy and decayed dentin, providing a basis for differentiating between tissue  categories. each bacterial species demonstrated distinct spectral emission patterns.

TI  == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == survey of oral microbial diversity using pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == polymicrobial biofilms in the human oral cavity exhibit marked diversity. pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) surveys microbial diversity by displaying pcr-generated 16s rdna fragments that migrate at different distances, reflecting the differences in the base-pair (i.e., % g+c) composition of the fragment. this study examined dgge-generated diversity profiles of cultivable bacteria from individuals with different caries status. initially, we developed a set of pcr-dgge running conditions appropriate to oral  bacteria. next, we assessed migration standards from known oral bacterial reference strains. to test the methods, we profiled 20 bacterial saliva samples cultivated from young adults. the study produced a battery of species-specific 16s rdna amplicons that could be used as a migration distance standard necessary  for computer-assisted profile analysis. from the clinical samples, we found a significantly greater diversity of oral microbes in caries-free individuals compared with caries-active individuals (p = 0.01). these findings suggest thtat  a portion of oral microbiota of caries-active individuals may be absent, suppressed, or replaced.

TI  == inhibitory effect of garlic extract on oral bacteria.
AB  == garlic (allium sativum) has long been known to have antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties but there are few data on its effects against oral bacterial species particularly putative periodontal pathogens or their enzymes. filter sterilised, aqueous extract of garlic was tested for ability to inhibit the growth of a range of oral species and to inhibit the trypsin-like and total protease activity porphyromonas gingivalis. the garlic extract (57.1% (w/v), containing 220 microg/ml allicin) inhibited the growth and killed most of the organisms tested. in general, the minimal inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the gram-negative strains (garlic mic range 35.7-1.1 mg/ml; allicin mean mic 4.1 microg/ml; mean mbc 7.9 microg/ml) were lower than those for the gram-positive strains tested (garlic mic range 142.7-35.7 mg/ml; allicin mean mic 27.5 microg/ml; mean mbc 91.9 microg/ml). also, of the organisms tested, the  putative periodontal pathogens had among the lowest mics (17.8-1.1 mg/ml garlic)  and mbcs (35.7-1.1 mg/ml garlic). time-kill curves for streptococcus mutans and p. ginigvalis, showed that killing of the latter started almost immediately, whereas there was a delay before s. mutans was killed. the garlic extract also inhibited the trypsin-like and total protease activity of p. gingivalis by 92.7%  and 94.88%, respectively. these data indicate that garlic extract inhibits the growth of oral pathogens and certain proteases and so may have therapeutic value, particularly for periodontitis.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

AB  == objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned  in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival  plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella  forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and  t3. levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3). mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns). proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3. conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.

TI  == phototargeting oral black-pigmented bacteria.
AB  == we have found that broadband light (380 to 520 nm) rapidly and selectively kills  oral black-pigmented bacteria (bpb) in pure cultures and in dental plaque samples obtained from human subjects with chronic periodontitis. we hypothesize that this killing effect is a result of light excitation of their endogenous porphyrins. cultures of prevotella intermedia and p. nigrescens were killed by 4.2 j/cm2, whereas p. melaninogenica required 21 j/cm2. exposure to light with a fluence of  42 j/cm2 produced 99% killing of p. gingivalis. high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of various amounts of different porphyrin molecules in bpb. the amounts of endogenous porphyrin in bpb were 267 (p. intermedia), 47 (p. nigrescens), 41 (p. melaninogenica), and 2.2 (p. gingivalis) ng/mg. analysis of bacteria in dental plaque samples by dna-dna hybridization for 40 taxa before and after phototherapy showed that the growth of the four bpb was decreased by 2 and 3 times after irradiation at energy fluences  of 4.2 and 21 j/cm2, respectively, whereas the growth of the remaining 36 microorganisms was decreased by 1.5 times at both energy fluences. the present study suggests that intraoral light exposure may be used to control bpb growth and possibly benefit patients with periodontal disease.

AB  == introduction: this study evaluates the efficacy of various antimicrobial treatments for orofacial infections on the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) criteria. methods: a complete a literature search was undertaken to establish the mic90 values of the five microorganisms most frequently isolated in odontogenic infections and the pharmacokinetic parameters of 13 antibiotics used in these infections. pharmacokinetic simulations were then carried out with mean population parameters and efficacy indexes were calculated for the 47 treatment regimens analyzed. for  drugs showing time-dependent antibacterial killing, the time above mic (t > mic)  was calculated. for drugs with concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, the auc/mic was calculated. results: amoxicillin-clavulanic (500 mg/8 h or 1000 mg/12 h) and clindamycin (300 mg/6 h) in the time-dependent killing group and moxifloxacin (400 mg/24 h) in the concentration-dependent group showed adequate efficacy indexes against the five pathogens considered to be the most commonly implicated in odontogenic infections. the spiramycin plus metronidazole combination, present in the commercial formulation rhodogyl, did not reach satisfactory pk/pd indexes. conclusion: pk/pd indexes, which are useful predictors of the potential efficacy of antibacterial therapy, were used with ontogenic infections in the present study. the pk/pd simulations showed that amoxicillin-clavulanic, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were the most suitable antibiotics for this kind of infection. clinical trials are required to confirm that this methodology is useful in these pathologic processes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of croton cajucara benth linalool-rich essential oil on artificial biofilms and planktonic microorganisms.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that a linalool-rich essential oil from croton cajucara benth presents leishmanicidal activity. in the present study, we demonstrate that this essential oil inhibits the growth of reference samples of candida albicans, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sobrinus, porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus mutans cell suspensions, all of them associated with oral cavity disease. the purified linalool fraction was only inhibitory for c. albicans. microbes of saliva specimens from human individuals with fixed orthodontic appliances, as well as the reference strains,  were used to construct an artificial biofilm which was exposed to linalool or to  the essential oil. as in microbial suspensions, the essential oil was toxic for all the microorganisms, while the purified linalool fraction mainly inhibited the growth of c. albicans. the compounds of the essential oil were separated by thin  layer chromatography and exposed to the above-cited microorganisms. in this analysis, the proliferation of the bacterial cells was inhibited by still uncharacterized molecules, and linalool was confirmed as the antifungal component of the essential oil. the effects of linalool on the cell biology of c. albicans  were evaluated by electron microscopy, which showed that linalool induced a reduction in cell size and abnormal germination. neither the crude essential oil  nor the purified linalool fraction is toxic to mammalian cells, which suggests that the essential oil or its purified components may be useful to control the microbial population in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.

TI  == periodontal infections and pre-term low birth weight: a case-control study.
AB  == objective: pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (plbw)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. there is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence plbw infants. recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for plbw. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and plbw by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. methods:  clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum.  subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were  analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. in all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. statistical methods included student's t-test, fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. results: the cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). there were no statistically  significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental  and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than  in the cases (p<0.05). the occurrence rates of p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and s. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). according to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, p. micros and c. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of plbw (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). conclusion: the present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, p. micros and c. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for plbw, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of plbw. further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and plbw.

AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == phototoxic effect of visible light on porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum: an in vitro study.
AB  == the antibacterial effect of visible light irradiation combined with photosensitizers has been reported. the objective of this was to test the effect  of visible light irradiation without photosensitizers on the viability of oral microorganisms. strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus faecalis in suspension or grown on agar were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400-500 nm. these wavelengths are used to photopolymerize composite resins widely used for dental restoration. three photocuring light sources, quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp, light-emitting diode and plasma-arc, at power densities between 260 and 1300 mw/cm2 were used for up to 3 min. bacterial samples were also exposed to a near-infrared diode laser (wavelength, 830 nm), using identical irradiation parameters for comparison. the results show that blue light sources exert a phototoxic effect on p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum. the minimal inhibitory dose for p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum was 16-62 j/cm2, a value significantly lower than that for s. mutans and s. faecalis (159-212 j/cm2). near-infrared diode laser irradiation did not affect any of the bacteria tested. our results suggest that visible light sources without exogenous photosensitizers have a phototoxic effect mainly on gram-negative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == increase in cariogenic bacteria after initial periodontal therapy.
AB  == this study examined the hypothesis of an intra-oral shift, during initial periodontal therapy, from a periopathogenic to a cariogenic flora. seventy-one patients with periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment strategies: (1) scaling and root planing, quadrant by quadrant, at two-week intervals (nc); (2) full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 hrs (frp); or (3) full-mouth disinfection within 24 hrs, including antiseptics [chlorhexidine (chx) or amine fluoride/stannous fluoride (f) for 2 mos, or chx for 2 mos followed by f for 6 mos (chx+f)]. at baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 mos, bacterial samples were taken from supra- and subgingival plaque, saliva, and tongue. the detection frequencies and relative proportions of streptococcus mutans increased in the nc and frp groups, but decreased in the f group. in the chx group, these species disappeared temporarily, but they disappeared for the entire 8 mos in the chx+f group. these observations were similar for all sample locations. the periopathogens decreased in all groups. this finding confirms the  abovementioned hypothesis and indicates a need for caries prophylactic regimens.

TI  == microbiological basis of oral infections and sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  == because oral infections are common, the physician must understand the underlying  etiology, pathogeny, and other variables that determine how these processes evolve in order to choose the most appropriate antibiotic drug. the special characteristics of the oral cavity determine the make-up of the microflora that lives there. different anaerobic species belonging to the peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, gemella, and porphyromonas genera are of particular interest, as are the aerobic species streptococcus, staphylococcus, and corynebacterium. each of these microorganisms occupies a different microniche within the oral cavity, and the prevailing balance is upset when conditions become modified as a result of illness or due to dental interventions such as tooth extraction or tooth scaling and polishing. pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria (actinomyces, prevotella intermedia species, etc.) can develop in these  conditions, as can yeasts (candida sp., histoplasma capsulatum), virus (herpes simplex, papilomavirus), and parasites (entamoeba gingivalis, trichomonas tenax). when infection occurs, the patients s immune system reacts by means of inborn immunity (non-specific) and acquired immunity (specific). empirical treatment is  administered that should be based on etiological data and on the antimicrobial sensitivity of the pathogen that is causing the infection. however, oral microflora sensitivity to different antibiotics is currently declining and there  is a noticeable trend towards resistances. as a consequence of all this, the treatment of oral infections must also aim to restore the ecological balance of the oral cavity and to minimize the emergence of resistance in the microorganisms present in the mouth. hence, epidemiological oral pathogen sensitivity studies must be conducted, fostering the administration of appropriate antibiotics at proper doses and keeping specialists abreast of the latest trends. in recent decades, oral infections comprise one of the most common pathologies in the general population, due in large part to infectious complications associated with poor oral hygiene. this in turn, translates into an increased need and demand for dental care, while at the same time, it requires that the professional accurately understand the etiological factors involved, as well as the pathogeny and different variables that determine the specificity of these kinds of infections,  so as to be able to choose the appropriate antimicrobial drugs for proper treatment.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics against periodontopathogenic bacteria within epithelial cells: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: periodontopathogenic bacteria can invade and survive within epithelial cells, but susceptibility of intracellular infection to antibiotics used in periodontitis treatment has not been studied to date. methods: kb cells were infected by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, strain nctc 9710; porphyromonas gingivalis, strains atcc 33277 and jh16-1; or streptococcus constellatus, strain j012b. after 2, 4, and 12 hours the bactericidal effect of antibiotics (clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin) on intracellular microorganisms was tested at a concentration up to the 100-fold minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined separately on planktonic bacteria. results: the p. gingivalis strains differed in their invasiveness and atcc 33277 was 100-fold more invasive than jh16-1. doxycycline and clindamycin at a concentration 10-fold mic had no effect, but p. gingivalis intercellular infection was significantly reduced by metronidazole at 10-fold mic after 2 and 4 hours. moxifloxacin was effective, but a 100-fold mic concentration was necessary to reduce p. gingivalis strains intracellular growth to 7% of the control. other  bacterial species grown inside the kb cells were more susceptible to antibiotics. clindamycin at 10-fold mic reduced the number of intracellular s. constellatus after 4 and 12 hours. this bacterium was eliminated by moxifloxacin at 50-fold mic. intracellular a. actinomycetemcomitans was killed by 10-fold mic of doxycycline and moxifloxacin after 4 hours incubation. conclusions: moxifloxacin  was the most efficient antibiotic to treat intracellular infection. however, taking into account the mic values and the levels of antibiotics in gingival fluid, elimination of intracellular bacteria by antibiotics alone seems to be questionable.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == identification of early microbial colonizers in human dental biofilm.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the first colonizers within in vivo dental biofilm and to establish potential population shifts that occur during the early phases of biofilm formation. methods and results: a 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization assay was employed to identify 40 different bacterial strains. dental biofilm samples were collected from 15 healthy subjects, 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after tooth cleaning and the composition of these samples was compared with that of whole saliva collected from the same individuals. the bacterial distribution in biofilm samples was distinct from that in saliva, confirming the selectivity of the adhesion process. in the very early stages, the predominant tooth colonizers were found to be actinomyces species. the relative proportion of streptococci, in particular streptococcus mitis and s. oralis, increased at the expense of actinomyces species between 2 and 6 h while the absolute level of actinomyces remained unaltered. periodontal pathogens such as tannerella forsythensis(bacteroides forsythus), porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola as well as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were present in extremely low levels at all the examined time intervals in this healthy group of  subjects. conclusion: the data provide a detailed insight into the bacterial population shifts occurring within the first few hours of biofilm formation and show that the early colonizers of the tooth surface predominantly consist of beneficial micro-organisms. significance and impact of the study: the early colonizers of dental plaque are of great importance in the succession stages of biofilm formation and its overall effect on the oral health of the host.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases--review of publications].
AB  == nowadays periodontal diseases are treated as a one of a social diseases. the main consequences of them are: premature teeth loss and possibility of inducing, aggravating and modifying many systemic disorders, such as endo- and myocarditis, glomerulonephritis, iriditis, retinitis, rheumatic polyarthritis. the scientific  data performed in the last 10 years indicate links between periodontitis and atheromatosis, coronary heart disease and acute coronary events, including myocardial infarction. in this study reported was the epidemiological dependences between periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. there were described hypotheses  of negative influence of periodontal foci on induction and progression of inflammation in coronary vessel walls and destabilisation of atheromatous plaques, also was included theory of direct bacterial invasion and cytokine theory. there were shown results of studies which proved the presence of genetic  material of main periodontal bacterial pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, in atheromatous plaques in coronary arteries. there were noted other potential mechanisms of induction of acute coronary events connected with platelet aggregation induced by specific proteins  secreted by streptococcus sanguis and the role of helicobacter pylori infection,  the bacteria from periodontal pockets that is presently more often isolated. analysing these data it was concluded, that the co-operation between cardiologists and dentists, especially the periodontologists, is necessary during the treatment of coronary heart disease. periodontal therapy should be included as an additional element of cardiological therapy. education of patients is also  very important for prophylaxis of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of endodontic files after cleaning and steam sterilization procedures.
AB  == background: infection control procedures are essential for modern dental practice and they are continually evolving to meet the dental profession's high standards. the present study evaluated the efficacy of two cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers on endodontic files, and evaluated the effect of biological debris on the subsequent sterilization of files. methods: stainless steel and nickel-titanium (niti) files were examined upon removal from the manufacturer's packaging, after instrumentation in root canals of human teeth inoculated with a  broth containing two anaerobic species and one facultative anaerobic species of bacteria, and after instrumentation and cleaning with either an ultrasonic bath or a thermal disinfector. for each file, the bacterial numbers were quantified using routine microbiological techniques in an anaerobic chamber. results: no bacteria were detected from files direct from their packets. the size, taper and  type of file did not affect the ability of either of the cleaning procedures to reduce bacterial numbers. however, an absence of bacteria was more likely when files were cleaned in the thermal disinfector. no bacteria were detected from files that were-subjected to steam sterilization irrespective of the type of prior cleaning procedure. conclusions: steam sterilization eliminated all bacteria from the endodontic files irrespective of the presence of biological debris. the majority of bacteria were eliminated from endodontic files after either ultrasonic cleaning or using a thermal disinfector.

TI  == oral streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates interaction  with porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with plaque-forming bacteria is necessary for its colonization in periodontal pockets. participation of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and p. gingivalis fimbriae in this interaction has been reported. in this investigation, the contribution of various oral streptococcal gapdhs to interaction with p. gingivalis fimbriae was examined. streptococcal cell surface gapdh activity was measured by incubation of a constant number of streptococci with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and analysis for the conversion of nad+ to nadh based  on the absorbance at 340 nm. coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric assay. cell surface gapdh activity was correlated with coaggregation activity (r = 0.854, p < 0.01) with spearman's rank correlation coefficient. s. oralis atcc 9811 and atcc 10557, streptococcus gordonii g9b, streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556, and streptococcus parasanguinis atcc 15909 exhibited high cell surface gapdh activity and coaggregation activity; consequently, their cell surface gapdhs were extracted with mutanolysin and purified on a cibacron blue sepharose column. subsequently, their dna sequences were elucidated. purified gapdhs bound p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin by western blot assay, furthermore, their dna sequences displayed a high degree of homology with one another. moreover, s. oralis recombinant gapdh inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and the aforementioned five streptococcal strains in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that gapdhs of various  plaque-forming streptococci may be involved in their attachment to p. gingivalis  fimbriae and that they may contribute to p. gingivalis colonization.

TI  == antibiotic resistance profile of the subgingival microbiota following systemic or local tetracycline therapy.
AB  == background: tetracyclines have been extensively used as adjunctives to conventional periodontal therapy. emergence of resistant strains, however, has been reported. this study evaluated longitudinally the tetracycline resistance patterns of the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects treated with systemic or local tetracycline therapy+scaling and root planing (srp). methods: thirty chronic periodontitis patients were randomly assigned to three groups: srp+500 mg of systemic tetracycline twice/day for 14 days; srp alone and srp+tetracycline fibers (actsite) at four selected sites for 10 days. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from four sites with probing pocket depths (ppd)> or =6 mm in each patient at baseline, 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months post-therapy. samples were dispersed and diluted in pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized ringer's solution, plated on trypticase soy agar (tsa)+5% blood with or without 4 microg/ml of tetracycline and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. the percentage of resistant microorganisms were determined and the isolates identified by dna probes and the checkerboard method. significance of differences among and within  groups over time was sought using the kruskal-wallis and friedman tests, respectively. results: the percentage of resistant microorganisms increased significantly at 1 week in the tetracycline groups, but dropped to baseline levels over time. the srp+actsite group presented the lowest proportions of resistant species at 6 and 12 months. no significant changes were observed in the srp group. the predominant tetracycline-resistant species included streptococcus  spp., veillonela parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, gemella morbillorum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). a high percentage of sites with resistant aa, porphyromonas gingivalis and tanerella forsythensis was observed in all groups at baseline. however, t. forsythensis was not detected in any group and p. gingivalis was not present in the srp+actsite group at 1 year post-therapy. aa was still frequently detected in all groups after therapy. however, the greatest reduction was observed in the srp+actsite group. conclusion: local or systemically administered tetracycline results in transitory selection of subgingival species intrinsically resistant to this drug. although the percentage of sites harboring periodontal pathogens resistant to tetracycline were quite elevated in this population, both therapies were effective in reducing their prevalence over time.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == efficacy of antibiotics to strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria within a single species biofilm - an in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: this study examined differences in the efficacy of antibiotics against a single strain of three periodontal pathogens grown in an artificial biofilm. methods: single species biofilms were established with artificial saliva and one of the following bacterial strains: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  y4, streptococcus constellatus 384b (a clinical isolate) and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277. the efficacy of the antibiotics clindamycin, doxycycline,  metronidazole, and moxifloxacin to these bacteria was determined using concentrations up to 100-fold minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) to planctonic bacteria over 48 h. results: the ability of the bacteria to form a biofilm varied. the biofilms of s. constellatus 384b and a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 contained more viable bacteria and showed a larger thickness in sem photographs than those of p. gingivalis atcc 33277. the antibiotics tested showed different efficacy for the different strains. moxifloxacin was the most efficient antibiotic: onefold mic was sufficient to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and p. gingivalis atcc 33277 after 48 h. however, only the 50-fold mic completely eradicated s. constellatus 384b. sem photographs underlined the damaging effect of moxifloxacin on the biofilm structure. conclusion: the complete removal of bacteria by the use of antibiotics alone seems to be impossible when taking into  account mic values and the level of antibiotics in gingival fluid.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a  second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.

TI  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to confirm the relationships between oral malodor  and periodontal condition, oral malodor and tongue coating, and to investigate the secretory-immunoglobulin a (s-iga) level in saliva in relation to the accumulation of tongue coating. methods: fifty-four patients complaining of oral  malodor were included in the study. their periodontal conditions, tongue coating  status and salivary characteristics (flow rate, protein and s-iga concentrations) were assessed in addition to the level of volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) in oral cavity. the patients were divided into three groups according to their tongue coating level. results: there are significant relationships between oral malodor  and specific periodontal parameters used. the degree of tongue coating was also significantly correlated with the amount of h2s, ch3sh and the total amount of vsc determined. the concentration of s-iga in the group identified as slight tongue coating was significantly higher than in the moderate or the severe group. by western immunoblotting analysis, a high level of s-iga specific to streptococcus species was recognized in all groups, whereas the reactivity of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum with s-iga was very weak in  both the slight and the moderate groups. conclusion: data herein indicate that tongue coating is closely related to oral malodor. furthermore, s-iga in saliva may influence the accumulation of tongue coating, and s-iga antibodies directed to streptococcus species may play a role in protective immunity against the initial colonization of tongue plaque.

TI  == glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of streptococcus oralis functions as a coadhesin for porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  == cohesive interactions between porphyromonas gingivalis and plaque-forming bacteria, such as streptococcus oralis, are considered to play an important role  in the colonization of p. gingivalis in periodontal sites. although p. gingivalis fimbriae have been reported to mediate coaggregation with s. oralis, the s. oralis molecule involved has not been identified. we identified the coadhesin of  s. oralis atcc 9811 and purified it by affinity column chromatography. we found that the molecular mass of the purified protein was approximately 40 kda. dot blot and western blot assays showed binding of the 40-kda protein to p. gingivalis fimbriae. further, turbidimetric assays showed that the coadhesin inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and s. oralis in a dose-dependent manner. analyses of the amino-terminal sequences of the protein and its lysyl endopeptidase-cleaved fragments revealed that the coadhesin was identical to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh). next, we cloned the gene that encodes s. oralis gapdh and found that the sequence had a high degree of homology with the sequences of gapdhs of various bacteria, including streptococcus gordonii and fusobacterium nucleatum. to confirm the contribution of s. oralis gapdh to the interaction with p. gingivalis, a recombinant gapdh protein was generated in escherichia coli; this protein bound to p. gingivalis fimbriae and had an inhibitory effect on coaggregation. these results suggest that s. oralis gapdh functions as a coadhesin for p. gingivalis fimbriae. in addition, considering the high degree of homology of the gapdhs of various bacteria, those  of other plaque-forming bacteria also may contribute to the colonization of p. gingivalis.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis genes involved in fima regulation.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an important component of the complex plaque biofilm  that is a direct precursor of periodontal disease. the major fimbriae are required for attachment to oral surfaces and are an important virulence factor. fimbrillin (fima) expression in p. gingivalis is inhibited by surface molecule of streptococcus cristatus, an early colonizer of dental plaque. in this study, differential display pcr was used to identify p. gingivalis genes that are regulated in response to s. cristatus. of several differentially expressed genes, pg2131 and pg2167 were upregulated by s. cristatus signaling molecules. a null mutant of pg2167 did not transcriptionally regulate fima following exposure to s. cristatus. in fact, fima transcription was enhanced in the pg2167 mutant, suggesting that pg2167 may act to repress fima expression. in contrast, a mutation in pg2131 did not affect transcription of fima in the presence of s. cristatus. however, production of fimbrillin was significantly diminished in the  pg2131 mutant, implicating involvement in posttranscriptional regulation in fimbriation. these data suggest that p. gingivalis fimbriation is controlled by more than one regulation mechanism, involving both transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes.

TI  == innate immune response of oral and foreskin keratinocytes: utilization of different signaling pathways by various bacterial species.
AB  == the innate immune response is critical for the epithelial antimicrobial barrier.  the human beta-defensins are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides that are made by epithelial cells and that play a role in mucosal and skin defenses. human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) is expressed constitutively in epithelial tissues, whereas hbd-2 and hbd-3 are expressed in response to bacterial stimuli or inflammation. previous studies showed that hbd-2 was induced by fusobacterium nucleatum cell wall extract without the involvement of the nf-kappab transcription factors, which typically are associated with innate immunity and inflammation. the goal of this study was to characterize signaling pathways involved in hbd-2 induction in response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. cultured human oral and foreskin keratinocytes were treated separately with inhibitors of nf-kappab, c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk), and p38 and then stimulated with oral commensal streptococcus gordonii, oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, skin commensal staphylococcus epidermidis, or skin pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. different bacteria induced different levels of hbd-2 and in response to the various inhibitors tested, although certain common patterns were observed for commensal-  and pathogen-stimulated cells. hbd-2 induction by all bacteria tested was partially or completely blocked by inhibitors of the jnk and p38 pathways. however, in addition, hbd-2 induction by pathogenic bacteria in both oral and foreskin keratinocytes was blocked by inhibitors of nf-kappab. the results indicate that commensal and pathogenic bacteria utilize different pathways in hbd-2 induction and suggest that epithelial cells from different body sites have  common signaling mechanisms to distinguish between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  == cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. we tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. the essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against p. gingivalis. all the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of s. mutans. this study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. from the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibody inhibiting dipeptidylaminopeptidase iv activity of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species implicated as an important pathogen in the development of adult periodontitis. we previously cloned a gene encoding dipeptydilaminopeptidase iv (dapiv) from p. gingivalis. in the present study, for immunological diagnosis and development of  passive immunization, we produced a mouse monoclonal antibody (mab) capable of inhibiting the dapiv activity of p. gingivalis using highly purified recombinant  dapiv as an immunogen. the constructed mab, designated as mab-pg-dap-1, significantly inhibited dapiv activity in p. gingivalis, as well as slightly inhibited that in other gram-negative bacteria such as porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella loesheii, whereas no inhibition was seen in the gram-positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus. furthermore, the mab did  not inhibit dapiv enzyme activity in human serum. this novel mab may be useful for the development of immunological diagnosis capability and in passive immunization.

AB  == objectives: microbial flora and gingival conditions were compared between a group of patients with phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia as a test group, a control group of patients who were administered phenytoin without gingival hyperplasia and a blank group who took no phenytoin and no gingival hyperplasia in mentally retarded patients. materials and methods: subgingival plaque samples  were collected from a pht-induced overgrown gingival pocket and microbiological experiments were performed by culture and pcr methods. results: the predominant genera in total cultivable bacteria from subgingival plaque samples were streptococcus and actinomyces with recovery ranges of 37.6-42.1% and 23.4-25.5% of total bacteria, respectively, in all groups. the test group showed a significantly higher level of obligate gram-negative rods than the control and blank groups. black-pigmented obligate anaerobic gram-negative rods were detected in 10.3% of total cultivable bacteria in the test group. the black-pigmented rods were predominantly prevotella intermedia in the test group and prevotella nigrescens in the control and blank groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis were also detected in the test group with small values. conclusions: these results suggested that black-pigmented rods, particularly p. intermedia, could be habitable in the environment of gingival hyperplasia.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == reduction of potential respiratory pathogens by oral hygienic treatment in patients undergoing endotracheal anesthesia.
AB  == purpose: this study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of mechanical and chemical prophylactic oral cleansing treatments for reducing potential respiratory pathogens existing in the oral cavity. methods: thirty-two patients scheduled to undergo oral and maxillofacial surgery that required endotracheal anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the two groups, the oral cleansing group (n = 16) or the noncleansing group (n = 16). culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods were used to detect and enumerate pathogens. oral cleansing was carried out with an electric toothbrush capable of automatically supplying and aspirating povidone-iodine solution before surgery, followed by rinsing twice a day after surgery. cephazolin (3 g x day(-1)) was given to all patients for 5 days after surgery. results: the pcr detection rates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and porphyromonas gingivalis in gargle samples before treatment were 87.5%, 68.8%, 53.1%, and 40.6%, respectively. oral cleansing reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. in contrast, there was no significant reduction of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus species, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or p. aeruginosa in subjects who underwent systemic cephazolin administration without oral cleansing. conclusion: the combination of mechanical and chemical oral cleansing resulted in a significant reduction of potential respiratory pathogens  in the oral cavity.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == application of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to the analysis of  microbial communities of subgingival plaque.
AB  == objectives: denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was applied to the microbiologic examination of subgingival plaque. materials and methods: the pcr primers were designed from conserved nucleotide sequences on 16s ribosomal rna gene (16srdna) with gc rich clamp at the 5'-end. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  was performed using the primers and genomic dnas of typical periodontal bacteria. the generated 16srdna fragments were separated by denaturing gel. results: although the sizes of the amplified dna fragments were almost the same among the  species, 16srdnas of the periodontal bacteria were distinguished according to their specific sequences. the microflora of clinical plaque samples were profiled by the pcr-dgge method, and the dominant 16srdna bands were cloned and sequenced. simultaneously, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were detected by an ordinary pcr method. in the deep periodontal pockets, the bacterial community structures were complicated and p. gingivalis was the most dominant species, whereas the dgge profiles were simple and streptococcus or neisseria species were dominant in the shallow pockets. the  species-specific pcr method revealed the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the clinical samples. however, corresponding bands were not always observed in the dgge profiles, indicating a lower sensitivity of the dgge method. conclusion: although the dgge method may have a lower sensitivity than the ordinary pcr methods, it could visualize the bacterial qualitative compositions and reveal the major species of the plaque. the dgge analysis and following sequencing may have the potential to be a promising bacterial examination procedure in periodontal diseases.

AB  == this pilot study evaluated, by culture testing, the effectiveness of lethal photosensitization for the microbiological treatment of peri-implantitis in dogs. experimental peri-implantitis was induced by ligature placement for 2 months. following ligature removal, plaque control was instituted by scrubbing with 0.12% chlorhexidine daily for 12 months. subsequently, mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated for scaling the implant surface. microbial samples were obtained with paper points before and after treatment of implant surfaces by means of 100 microg/ml toluidine blue o (tbo,) and were exposed, for 80 s, to light with a wavelength of 685 nm from a 50 mw gaalas diode laser. the mean initial and final  bacterial counts were 7.22 +/- 0.20 and 6.84 +/- 0.44 cfu/ml, respectively for tvc (p < 0.0001); 6.19 +/- 0.45 and 3.14 +/- 3.29 cfu/ml for p. intermedia/nigrescens (p = 0.001); 5.98 +/- 0.38 and 1.69 +/- 2.90 cfu/ml for fusobacterium spp. (p = 0.001); and 6.07 +/- 0.22 to 1.69 +/- 2.94 cfu/ml for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (p = 0.0039). it may be concluded that lethal photosensitization resulted in a reduction of the bacterial count. complete elimination of bacteria was achieved in some samples.

AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp,  beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was  detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  == it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to  identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2  was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by  ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria  faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2  and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.

TI  == antibacterial activity of synthetic human b defensin-2 against periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. human b defensin-2 (hbd-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or  stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. this peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. therefore, it is thought that hbd-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. however, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. the aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. the antibacterial activity of synthetic hbd-2 was tested against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and escherichia coli. antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were  performed in vitro. the antibacterial activity of hbd-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. furthermore, the activity of  hbd-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. our results suggest the possibility that synthetic  hbd-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.

TI  == pcr method is essential for detecting mycobacterium tuberculosis in oral cavity samples.
AB  == tuberculosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, and infection by mycobacterium  tuberculosis has been increasing in immunocompromised hosts, including elderly persons. m. tuberculosis-infected persons may receive dental treatment. to evaluate the risk of m. tuberculosis infection in dental clinics, we examined the detection rates of m. tuberculosis in sample of mixed saliva, dental plaque, extracted teeth, caries lesions, and denture plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the detection rates by pcr in samples from mixed saliva, dental plaque, caries lesions and denture plaque obtained from tuberculosis patients were 98.0%, 92.0%, 89.0%, and 100%, respectively. the detection rates by the culture method were 17.3%, 2.0%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. m. tuberculosis also was detected from the nontuberculous mycobacteria-infected group. strains of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum inhibited the growth of clinical strains of m. tuberculosis, but strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans did not. the present study concludes that the pcr method is essential for detecting m. tuberculosis in oral samples.

TI  == antibacterial characteristics of newly developed amphiphilic lipids and dna-lipid complexes against bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of newly  developed amphiphilic lipids and dna/lipid complexes against two types of oral bacteria and two types of hospital infection bacteria. nine amphiphilic lipids were quantitatively prepared from the reaction of n-alkyl alcohol, alpha-amino acids, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. nine dna-lipid complexes were prepared by the  simple mixing of dna and amphiphilic lipids. the dna-lipid complexes were insoluble in water. the antibacterial activity of lipids and dna-lipid complexes  against porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated by the disk-diffusion method. seven artificial lipids showed antibacterial behavior; in particular, the lipids prepared from n-decyl alcohol and glycine and from n-decyl alcohol and l-alanine  showed antibacterial activity against the four bacterial strains used in this study. on the other hand, the lipids of glutamic acid derivatives did not show any antibacterial activity against the four bacteria strains except for the lipid with an n-octyl group. five dna-lipid complexes also had an antibacterial effect. the complex prepared from dna and glycine decyl ester p-toluenesulfonic acid salt exhibited antibacterial activity against the four types of bacteria strains. in this study it was found that lipids and dna-lipid complexes with a mono-decyl group or a mono-dodecyl group have more favorable antibacterial activity.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) for direct visualization of bacteria in periapical lesions of asymptomatic root-filled teeth.
AB  == whether micro-organisms can live in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth is under debate. the aim of the present study was to visualize and identify micro-organisms within periapical lesions directly, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) in combination with epifluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). thirty-nine periapical lesions were surgically removed, fixed, embedded in cold polymerizing resin and sectioned. the probe eub  338, specific for the domain bacteria, was used together with a number of species-specific 16s rrna-directed oligonucleotide probes to identify bacteria. to control non-specific binding of eub 338, probe non 338 was used. alternatively, dapi (4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining was applied to record prokaryotic and eukaryotic dna in the specimens. hybridization with non 338 gave no signals despite background fluorescence of the tissue. the eubacterial probe showed bacteria of different morphotypes in 50 % of the lesions. rods, spirochaetes and cocci were spread out in areas of the tissue while other parts seemed bacteria-free. bacteria were also seen to co-aggregate inside the tissue, forming microcolonies. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis and treponemes of phylogenetic group i were detected with specific probes. in addition, colonies with streptococcus spp. were seen in some lesions. a number of morphotypes occurred that could not be identified with the specific probes used, indicating the presence of additional bacterial species. clsm confirmed that bacteria were located in different layers  of the tissue. accordingly, the fish technique demonstrated mixed consortia of bacteria consisting of rods, spirochaetes and cocci in asymptomatic periapical lesions of root-filled teeth.

TI  == genetic relatedness and phenotypic characteristics of treponema associated with human periodontal tissues and ruminant foot disease.
AB  == treponema have been implicated recently in the pathogenesis of digital dermatitis (dd) and contagious ovine digital dermatitis (codd) that are infectious diseases  of bovine and ovine foot tissues, respectively. previous analyses of treponemal 16s rdna sequences, pcr-amplified directly from dd or codd lesions, have suggested relatedness of animal treponema to some human oral treponema species isolated from periodontal tissues. in this study a range of adhesion and virulence-related properties of three animal treponema isolates have been compared with representative human oral strains of treponema denticola and treponema vincentii. in adhesion assays using biotinylated treponemal cells, t. denticola cells bound in consistently higher numbers to fibronectin, laminin, collagen type i, gelatin, keratin and lactoferrin than did t. vincentii or animal treponema isolates. however, animal dd strains adhered to fibrinogen at equivalent or greater levels than t. denticola. all treponema strains bound to the amino-terminal heparin i/fibrin i domain of fibronectin. 16s rdna sequence analyses placed ovine strain ub1090 and bovine strain ub1467 within a cluster that was phylogenetically related to t. vincentii, while ovine strain ub1466 appeared more closely related to t. denticola. these observations correlated with phenotypic properties. thus, t. denticola atcc 35405, gm-1, and treponema ub1466  had similar outer-membrane protein profiles, produced chymotrypsin-like protease  (ctlp), trypsin-like protease and high levels of proline iminopeptidase, and co-aggregated with human oral bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus crista. conversely, t. vincentii atcc 35580, d2a-2, and animal strains ub1090 and ub1467 did not express ctlp or trypsin-like protease and did not co-aggregate with p. gingivalis or s. crista. taken collectively, these results suggest that human oral-related treponema have broad host specificity and that similar control or preventive strategies might be developed for human and animal treponema-associated infections.

TI  == production of a single-chain variable fraction capable of inhibiting the streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase in bacillus brevis: construction of a chimeric shuttle plasmid secreting its gene product.
AB  == periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases, in these days, and the  passive immunization is one of the most effective approaches for prevention. for  this purpose, we have constructed mouse and human monoclonal antibodies to inhibit the porphyromonas gingivalis-associated hemagglutination and coaggregation. in addition, an artificial antibody, single-chain variable fraction, or scfv, which also inhibited the hemagglutination, was constructed. specifically for dental caries, mouse and human monoclonal antibodies that inhibited the glucosyltransferase (gtf) activity, responsible for biofilm formation, were also constructed. the advantage of scfv over the native antibody  is that the former molecule does not induce possible side-effects due to fc, such as autoimmune disease, because it consists only of variable regions originating from both heavy and light chains. to increase the abilities of the antibody preparations, we attempted to construct an additional scfv using bacillus brevis, a secretion-proficient gram-positive bacterium, as a host cell. an scfv protein possessing the same biological activity as that of the parental antibody was successfully secreted from a b. brevis transformant following the construction of a chimeric shuttle plasmid, which was accomplished by employing a new heterodimer system.

TI  == the photobleaching of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine in microbial systems.
AB  == front-face illumination spectroscopic techniques were used to study photobleaching of disulfonated aluminium phthalocyanine (alpcs2) in the bacteria  and yeast cells escherichia coil, porphyromonas gingivalis (gram-negative bacteria), streptococcus mutans (a gram-positive bacterium), and the yeast candida albicans. the photobleaching of alpcs2 with the microbes studied is complex, involving reactive species generated by type i and type ii processes with the rate dependent on the relative contributions of the different photobleaching mechanisms. the average rate of photobleaching of the alpcs2 monomer in the presence of both e. coli and c. albicans increases as the fluence  of the illumination source decreases. the effects of oxygen and sensitiser concentration on the rate of alpcs2 photobleaching in these systems are also investigated.

TI  == [the influence of two implant materials on the growth of three subgingival predominant bacteria].
AB  == objective: commercially pure titanium and titanium alloy as dental implants have  show impressive clinical results. despite the high success rates, some implants do fail. compared to those studies on osseointegration of implants, the information pertaining to their failure is little. further studies on the relationship between implant material and micro-organism are needed. the purpose  of this investigation is to study the effect of two commonly used implant materials titanium (ta2) and ti-6ai-4v alloy (tc4) on the growth behaviour of three subgingival predominant bacteria streptococcus sanguis (s. s), porphyromanus gingivalis (p. g), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. n) and their mixture. methods: under anaerobic condition, bacterial suspensions of s.s, p.g, f.n and their mixture were incubated together with the two implant materials respectively, setting the same bacterial suspensions as controls. after 2, 7 and  14 days, the bacterial growth amount was assayed by means of clone forming unit (cfu) method. the ph value of the bacterial suspension was determined by ph-meter. results: the results showed that there was no difference in amount of bacterial growth or ph value between ta2 group and tc4 group (p > 0.05). there was also no statistically significant change as to the proportion of individual bacteria in bacterial mixture or the ph value of culture suspension. conclusion:  under the condition of this investigation, the two studies implant materials have no examined influences on the growth of the subgingival bacteria and the ph value of their culture environment.

TI  == [investigation on interaction between streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis in specific pathogen-free rats].
AB  == objective: to examine whether endogenous s. sanguis could prevent, or reduce the  colonization of the virulent p. gingivalis strain. methods: first, 10 specific pathogen-free wistar rats were divided into 2 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days. successful implantation of the endogenous strain of s. sanguis, isolated from one of the rats before doxycycline administration, and p. gingivalis 381 within 14 days of observation were demonstrated in the rats of each group respectively. then, 30 spf rats were divided into 6 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days to all the rats. afterwards, the rats in group a and b were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with p. gingivalis, the rats in group c and e were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with s. sanguis. then, the rats in group  a were inoculated for 5 days with s. sanguis, and rats in group c and d were inoculated for 5 days with p. gingivalis. the rats in group f served as negative  control. after inoculation, the levels of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis in the mouths of the rats were determined after 12, 24, 36 hours, 7 days and 14 days. results: both pre-colonization of s. sanguis and superinfection with s. sanguis did reduce the level of p. gingivalis in experimental rats. however, the reduction only maintained quite short time, about 36 hours. it was not caused by  the decreased level of s. sanguis after 36 hours because the level of s. sanguis  kept stable during the observation period of 14 days. conclusion: that s. sanguis function as the effector strain requires the successful implantation of s. sanguis as well as s. sanguis producing antagonistic action efficiently in vivo.

TI  == periodontal diseases, caries, and microbial composition of the subgingival plaque in children: a longitudinal study.
AB  == the present study compares periodontal parameters, caries, and levels of colony forming units (cfu) of bacteria from subgingival plaque of permanent teeth, to those of primary teeth examined 4 years previously. six children who had periodontitis and 5 who had no periodontitis in primary teeth (groups a and b respectively) were examined. the microbial examination included the number of cfu of the total anaerobic count, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. the differences in cfu values for the permanent teeth between groups a and b were not significant. group a had significantly higher gingival inflammation values in the permanent teeth than group b. permanent teeth had significantly higher cfu values of p. gingivalis than the primary teeth. based on the present limited sample, the number of cfu from bacteria of the subgingival plaque of primary teeth are not an adequate predictor of periodontal disease or caries in the permanent teeth.

TI  == bacterial colonization of zirconia ceramic surfaces: an in vitro and in vivo study.
AB  == purpose: the microbial colonization of new ceramic materials developed for abutment manufacturing was assessed. materials and methods: the materials used in these experiments were disks of 'as-fired' and 'rectified' ceramic material made  of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals stabilized with yttrium (y-tzp) and commercially pure grade 2 titanium (ti) with corresponding eluates. they were tested in vitro with the following bacteria: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, and porphyromonas gingivalis. proliferation  was evaluated on plates by inhibitory halos around pits, previously inoculated with eluates obtained from the materials. bacterial adhesion on materials was quantified by spectrophotometric evaluation of the slime production by the same bacteria. moreover, early bacterial adhesion was evaluated in human volunteers and observed with sem. results: no inhibition of bacterial proliferation using eluates was observed. in vitro as-fired and rectified y-tzp showed significantly  more adherent s. mutans than did ti disks, while s. sanguis seemed to adhere easily to ti specimens. no differences were noted for actinomyces spp and p. gingivalis. in vivo y-tzp accumulated fewer bacteria than ti in terms of the total number of bacteria and presence of potential putative pathogens such as rods. no differences were observed between rectified and as-fired y-tzp. discussion: overall, y-tzp accumulates fewer bacteria than ti. conclusion: y-tzp  may be considered as a promising material for abutment manufacturing.

TI  == luxs-based signaling in streptococcus gordonii: autoinducer 2 controls carbohydrate metabolism and biofilm formation with porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == communication based on autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is widespread among gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, and the ai-2 pathway can control the expression of genes  involved in a variety of metabolic pathways and pathogenic mechanisms. in the present study, we identified luxs, a gene responsible for the synthesis of ai-2,  in streptococcus gordonii, a major component of the dental plaque biofilm. s. gordonii conditioned medium induced bioluminescence in an ai-2 reporter strain of vibrio harveyi. an isogenic mutant of s. gordonii, generated by insertional inactivation of the luxs gene, was unaffected in growth and in its ability to form biofilms on polystyrene surfaces. in contrast, the mutant strain failed to induce bioluminescence in v. harveyi and was unable to form a mixed species biofilm with a luxs-null strain of the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. complementation of the luxs mutation in s. gordonii restored normal biofilm formation with the luxs-deficient p. gingivalis. differential display pcr demonstrated that the inactivation of s. gordonii luxs downregulated the expression of a number of genes, including gtfg, encoding glucosyltransferase; frua, encoding extracellular exo-beta-d-fructosidase; and lacd encoding tagatose  1,6-diphosphate aldolase. however, s. gordonii cell surface expression of sspa and sspb proteins, previously implicated in mediating adhesion between s. gordonii and p. gingivalis, was unaffected by inactivation of luxs. the results suggest that s. gordonii produces an ai-2-like signaling molecule that regulates  aspects of carbohydrate metabolism in the organism. furthermore, luxs-dependent intercellular communication is essential for biofilm formation between nongrowing cells of p. gingivalis and s. gordonii.

TI  == similarity of the oral microbiota of pre-school children with that of their caregivers in a population-based study.
AB  == this study evaluated the similarity between the oral microbiota of young children and that of their adult caregivers. oral samples from children (174 dentate and 18 pre-dentate) aged 6-36 months and their caregivers in saipan were assayed using a dna probe assay. many species including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces species, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium  nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in dentate and pre-dentate children, whereas bacteroides forsythus was detected only in dentate children. a higher percentage of children were positive for the detection of an individual species if the caregiver was also positive. there were significant relative risks of species detection between dentate children and their caregivers. by logistic regression, there were significant positive associations between species detection in caregiver and in child, but not between species detection and child age or maternal education level. in conclusion, dental pathogens were detected in young, including pre-dentate, children. the microbial profiles of children were strongly associated with the microbiota of their caregivers.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

AB  == aims: to determine the expediency of a microtitre assay system for establishing,  quantifying and antimicrobial testing of two representative oral pathogens. methods and results: streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used. morphological characteristics of the attached population were evaluated. biofilm  growth was evaluated spectrophotometrically (undisturbed and 1 n naoh dissipated  biofilm). the minimum concentration of chlorhexidine gluconate that inhibited biofilm growth was determined. growth of the biofilms was successfully monitored  by direct optical density measurements or those re-suspended in 1 n naoh. the latter was necessary when glucans were present in strep. mutans biofilms. the minimum concentration of chlorhexidine gluconate that inhibited biofilm growth was 1.25 microg ml(-1) for both species. the attached bacteria exhibited common biofilm characteristics. significance and impact of the study: the assay system developed was especially useful for monitoring the growth of adherent strep. mutans in the presence of glucans, which is particularly significant for the study of anti-plaque chemicals.

TI  == microbial/host interactions: mechanisms involved in host responses to microbial antigens.
AB  == the indigenous oral microflora and the host are normally in a state of equilibrium; however, the introduction of a pathogen can result in innate and adaptive immune responses that either contribute to the development of the disease or lead to host immunity. the interactions between the microorganisms and the host are very dynamic, thus allowing the complex interplay between host molecules and bacterial antigens. in this article, we focus on the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of and host responses to two oral pathogens: the gram-negative bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis, implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease, and the gram-positive streptococcus mutans, a primary agent  involved in dental caries formation. furthermore, we address mechanisms involved  in the ability of select adjuvants and delivery systems to potentiate mucosal and systemic immune responses to microbial vaccine antigens.

TI  == stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == enhanced neutrophil emigration and porphyromonas gingivalis reduction following pgg-glucan treatment of mice.
AB  == periodontal disease is the consequence of a mixed gram-negative infection in the  gingival sulcus and has been associated with deficits in the neutrophil response. a novel, and heretofore untested, alternative approach to therapy is the use of biological-response modulators that enhance the neutrophil response. poly-beta1-6-glucotriosyl-beta1-3-glucopyranose glucan (pgg-glucan) is an immunomodulator, derived from yeast, which specifically enhances neutrophil priming, phagocytosis and bacterial killing while failing to induce inflammatory  cytokine expression. the hypothesis tested was that pgg-glucan could enhance host resistance to a gram-negative periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. chambers were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsolumbar region of c57bl/6j mice and allowed to heal for 14 days. pgg-glucan was administered subcutaneously to one-half of the animals and saline to the other half. in the first set of experiments the chambers were inoculated with p. gingivalis (a7436) at 4 x 10 (6), 4 x 10 (7), and 4 x 10 (8) colony-forming units (cfu). in the second set of  experiments the chambers were inoculated with 5 x 10 (8) cfu of either p. gingivalis or streptococcus sanguis, a gram-positive oral microbe that is not periodontopathic. chambers were sampled over the following 2 weeks. the results demonstrated that: (1). bacterial cfu and neutrophils increased with increasing bacterial inoculum (p<0.02); (2). bacterial cfu were lower in the pgg-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (p<0.02); and (3). neutrophil counts were higher in the pgg-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (p<0.01). these results indicate that pgg-glucan significantly enhances neutrophil emigration and bacterial killing, thus decreasing the bacterial infection in this model system.

AB  == the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.

TI  == influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  == the influence of secondary colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. hydroxyapatite (hap) discs coated with streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3h-labeled bacterial cell suspension of  f. nucleatum or a. naeslundii and then in a 14c-labeled p. gingivalis cell suspension. bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. the cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. these two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of p. gingivalis. human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of p. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to s. sanguis-coated hap discs. adherence of p. gingivalis and a. naeslundii was  strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of f. nucleatum was affected the least.  treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of p. gingivalis. the rate of decrease was much smaller in f. nucleatum. these results indicate that both f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii enhance the adherence of p. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of p. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.

TI  == role of the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein in the development of porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms on streptococcal substrates.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an aggressive periodontal pathogen that persists in the mixed-species plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces. p. gingivalis cells attach to the plaque commensal streptococcus gordonii and this coadhesion event leads to the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. binding of these organisms is multimodal, involving both the p. gingivalis major fimbrial fima protein and the  species-specific interaction of the minor fimbrial mfa1 protein with the streptococcal sspb protein. this study examined the contribution of the mfa1-sspb interaction to p. gingivalis biofilm formation. p. gingivalis biofilms readily formed on substrata of s. gordonii dl1 but not on streptococcus mutans cells which lack a coadhesion-mediating homologue of sspb. an insertional inactivation  of the mfa1 gene in p. gingivalis resulted in a phenotype deficient in s. gordonii binding and unable to form biofilms. furthermore, analysis using recombinant streptococci and enterococci showed that p. gingivalis biofilms formed on enterococcus faecalis strains expressing sspb or translational fusions  of sspb with spap (the non-adherent sspb homologue in s. mutans) containing the p. gingivalis adherence domain (sspb adherence region, bar) of sspb. in contrast, an isogenic ssp null mutant of s. gordonii dl1 was unable to support biofilm growth, even though this strain bound to p. gingivalis fima at levels similar to  wild-type s. gordonii dl1. finally, site-specific mutation of two functional amino acid residues in bar resulted in sspb polypeptides that did not promote the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. these results suggest that the induction of p. gingivalis biofilms on a streptococcal substrate requires functional sspb-minor fimbriae interactions.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == in vivo induction of proinflammatory cytokines in mouse tissue by porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease initiated by a multitude of bacteria. persistent infection leads to generation of various inflammatory mediators, resulting in tissue destruction and osteoclastic resorption of the alveolar bone. this study describes a novel in vivo murine calvarial model to assess the effects of oral pathogens on the expression of three proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha] which are involved in bone resorption. we chose porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans as prototype oral pathogens. we also tested  the effects of streptococcus gordonii, an oral commensal supragingival microorganism, considered a non-pathogen. live bacteria were injected into subcutaneous tissue overlying the parietal bone of mice calvaria for 6 days. at the end of the experimental period, tissues overlying the calvaria were removed and analyzed for proinflammatory cytokine expression by northern blotting. cytokine mrna was not detected in the tissue over the calvaria of control animals. in contrast, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans elicited mrna expression of all three cytokines, tnfalpha being the highest (tnfalpha > > il-1beta > il-6). p. gingivalis was more potent than a. actinomycetemcomitans in  inducing cytokine expression. in contrast, s. gordonii induced only low levels of mrna for il-1beta and tnfalpha but no il-6 mrna induction. these results suggest  that oral microorganisms with access to host tissues elicit a battery of proinflammatory cytokines. there were clear differences in profiles and, interestingly, a commensal bacterium also stimulated bone resorptive cytokine expression in host tissues.

TI  == mice lacking monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 have enhanced susceptibility to an interstitial polymicrobial infection due to impaired monocyte recruitment.
AB  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) is an important chemokine that induces monocyte recruitment in a number of different pathologies, including infection. to investigate the role of mcp-1 in protecting a host from a chronic interstitial polymicrobial infection, dental pulps of mcp-1(-/-) mice and controls were inoculated with six different oral pathogens. in this model the recruitment of leukocytes and the impact of a genetic deletion on the susceptibility to infection can be accurately assessed by measuring the progression of soft tissue  necrosis and osteolytic lesion formation. the absence of mcp-1 significantly impaired the recruitment of monocytes, which at later time points was threefold higher in the wild-type mice than in mcp-1(-/-) mice (p < 0.05). the consequence  was significantly enhanced rates of soft tissue necrosis and bone resorption (p < 0.05). we also determined that the mcp-1(-/-) mice were able to recruit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) to a similar or greater extent as controls and to produce equivalent levels of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific total immunoglobulin g (igg) and igg1. these results point to the importance of mcp-1 expression and monocyte recruitment in antibacterial defense and demonstrate that antibacterial defense is not due to an indirect effect on pmn recruitment or modulation of the adaptive immune response.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == passive immunization against dental caries and periodontal disease: development of recombinant and human monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == indigenous micro-organisms in the oral cavity can cause two major diseases, dental caries and periodontal diseases. there is neither agreement nor consensus  as to the actual mechanisms of pathogenesis of the specific virulence factors of  these micro-organisms. the complexity of the bacterial community in dental plaque has made it difficult for the single bacterial agent of dental caries to be determined. however, there is considerable evidence that streptococcus mutans is  implicated as the primary causative organism of dental caries, and the cell-surface protein antigen (sa i/ii) as well as glucosyltransferases (gtfs) produced by s. mutans appear to be major colonization factors. various forms of periodontal diseases are closely associated with specific subgingival bacteria. porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as an important etiological agent of adult periodontitis. adherence of bacteria to host tissues is a prerequisite for  colonization and one of the important steps in the disease process. bacterial coaggregation factors and hemagglutinins likely play major roles in colonization  in the subgingival area. emerging evidence suggests that inhibition of these virulence factors may protect the host against caries and periodontal disease. active and passive immunization approaches have been developed for immunotherapy  of these diseases. recent advances in mucosal immunology and the introduction of  novel strategies for inducing mucosal immune responses now raise the possibility  that effective and safe vaccines can be constructed. in this regard, some successful results have been reported in animal experimental models. nevertheless, since the public at large might be skeptical about the seriousness  of oral diseases, immunotherapy must be carried out with absolute safety. for this goal to be achieved, the development of safe antibodies for passive immunization is significant and important. in this review, salient advances in passive immunization against caries and periodontal diseases are summarized, and  the biotechnological approaches for developing recombinant and human-type antibodies are introduced. furthermore, our own attempts to construct single-chain variable fragments (scfv) and human-type antibodies capable of neutralizing virulence factors are discussed.

TI  == modulating airway defenses against microbes.
AB  == prevention and treatment of respiratory infections remain an important health care challenge as the us population ages, contains more susceptible or high-risk  people, and encounters new pathogens or antibiotic resistant bacteria. reasonably protective vaccines against very common microbes are available for childhood and  adult immunization, but, generally, these are underutilized. a broader definition of higher risk individuals is evolving, which will include more for immunization. different approaches to vaccine development through design of new component vaccines are necessary. this review has updated host defense mechanisms at three  levels in the human respiratory tract: naso-oropharynx (upper airways), conducting airways, and alveolar space. examples of representative pathogenic microbes have been inserted at the respective airway segment where they may colonize or create infection (influenza, measles virus, porphyromonas gingivalis  causing periodontitis, bordetella pertussis, chlamydia pneumoniae, streptococcus  pneumoniae, and bacillus anthracis ). hopefully, microbe-host interactions will suggest new approaches for preventing these kinds of infections.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles in refractory periodontal disease.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to examine subgingival microbial profiles associated with refractory periodontitis and to seek such profiles in periodontally healthy, periodontally well-maintained elder  and untreated periodontitis subjects. methods: 36 subjects were defined as refractory on the basis of further attachment loss after scaling and root planing, surgery and systemically administered antibiotics. a total of 890 subgingival plaque samples (mean/subject=24.7) were taken from the mesial aspect  of each tooth in each subject at baseline and individually processed for their content of 40 subgingival taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. cluster  analysis was performed on mean within subject species counts using the chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. significant differences among clusters for individual and complexes of species were sought using the kruskal wallis test. the microbial profiles of the refractory subjects were compared with those of 27 periodontally healthy subjects (n plaque samples=708), 35 periodontally well-maintained elder subjects (n plaque samples=801) and 115 untreated adult periodontitis subjects (n plaque samples=2871). results: 28 of 36 refractory subjects fell into 4 clusters with >29% similarity. 10 of 40 species and 4 of 7 complexes differed significantly among clusters. profile (cluster) i (n=4) was characterized by high proportions of "yellow" and "green" complex species, profile ii (n=3) by low total counts and high proportions of "orange" and "purple" complex species, profile iii (n=9) by high total counts and counts of actinomyces and "purple" complex species, profile iv (n=12) by high proportions of "red" and "orange" complex species. the mean profiles of each cluster were subjected to cluster analysis with microbial data from 4380 (mean 24.7) baseline subgingival plaque samples from 27 periodontally healthy, 35 treated, well-maintained elders and 115 untreated adult periodontitis subjects. 12 clusters were formed with >41% similarity. 3 of the refractory profiles were detected in 3 cluster groups. profile ii in a cluster of 1 healthy, 1 elder and 4 untreated periodontitis subjects; profile iii in a cluster of 1 healthy, 2 elder  and 12 periodontitis subjects; profile iv, with 1 healthy and 5 untreated periodontitis subjects. the profile not detected in non refractory subjects was dominated by streptococcus species. 9 clusters did not harbor refractory profiles. 11.1% of healthy, 8.6% of elder and 18.3% of periodontitis subjects were in clusters exhibiting refractory microbial profiles. conclusions: 4 subgingival microbial profiles were detected among refractory subjects. "refractory microbial profiles" could be detected in subjects who had not yet exhibited refractory disease.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == oral bacteria and respiratory infection: effects on respiratory pathogen adhesion and epithelial cell proinflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == several microbiologic and epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between dental plaque, poor oral health, and respiratory diseases such as nosocomial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). a number of hypotheses are suggested to help explain how oral bacteria may participate in  the pathogenesis of respiratory infection. resident bacteria in oral secretions are likely aspirated along with respiratory pathogens and may affect the adhesion of the later organisms to the respiratory epithelium. preliminary studies performed in our laboratory suggest that oral bacteria may modulate the adhesion  of respiratory pathogens to epithelial cell lines. in addition, oral bacterial products or cytokines in oral/pharyngeal aspirates may stimulate cytokine production from respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. the resulting inflamed epithelium may be more susceptible to  respiratory infection. further preliminary data are presented that some species of oral bacteria may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cell lines to an extent similar to that seen for respiratory pathogens.

TI  == identification of 40-kda outer membrane protein as an aggregation factor of porphyromonas gingivalis to streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, aggregates with other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus gordonii. we previously succeeded in gene cloning the 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp) from p. gingivalis. although recombinant (r) 40-kda omp itself did not show aggregation activity, the affinity-purified antibody against 40-kda romp inhibited the aggregation activity of p. gingivalis cells toward s. gordonii which is one of the first oral bacteria to colonize on tooth surfaces and can be expected to support subsequent colonization of other bacteria. in this study, in order to clarify the pathological role of 40-kda omp, we used a cross-linking reagent to construct a polymeric form of r40-kda omp and examined its aggregation activity. the polymeric r40-kda omp significantly expressed aggregation activity with s. gordonii cells. moreover, the antibody against r40-kda omp inhibited the aggregation activity of the polymeric r40-kda omp. these findings clearly demonstrate that 40-kda omp, as a multivalent form, is one of the important aggregation factors on the cell surface of p. gingivalis.

AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of acute periradicular abscesses by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses of endodontic origin by using a molecular genetic method. study design: pus was collected by aspiration from 27 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 49 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with ubiquitous bacterial 16s  rrna gene primers. results: the results of the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis revealed that 37 of the 49 dna probes tested were reactive with one or more samples. the number of bacterial species in the pus samples ranged from 1 to 33 (mean, 5.9). eighteen of the 27 pus samples were positive for at least one dna probe. the most prevalent species found were: bacteroides forsythus (29.6% of the cases); porphyromonas gingivalis (29.6%); streptococcus constellatus (25.9%), prevotella intermedia (22.2%), prevotella nigrescens (22.2%), fusobacterium periodonticum (18.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (18.5%), and  eikenella corrodens (18.5%). conclusions: the microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods could provide additional knowledge regarding the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses by detecting  bacterial species that are difficult--or even impossible--to grow.

TI  == association of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways with gingival epithelial cell responses to porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  == mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase pathways are key factors in host signaling events and can also play important roles in the internalization of pathogenic bacteria by host cells. porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can efficiently invade human gingival epithelial cells (gecs). in this study, we examined the activation of map kinase pathways in gecs infected with p. gingivalis. c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) was activated after 5 min of infection  with p. gingivalis, whereas noninvasive streptococcus gordonii did not have a significant effect on jnk activation. in contrast, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) 1/2 was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner by p. gingivalis, but not by s. gordonii, after a 15-min exposure. nonmetabolically active p. gingivalis cells were unable to modulate map kinase activity. u0126, a specific inhibitor of mek1/2 (erk1/2 kinase), and toxin b, a specific inhibitor of rho family gtpases, had no effect on p. gingivalis invasion. genistein, a tyrosine protein kinase inhibitor, blocked uptake of p. gingivalis. the transcriptional regulator nf-kappab was not activated by p. gingivalis. these results suggest that p. gingivalis can selectively target components of the map kinase pathways.  erk1/2, while not involved in p. gingivalis invasion of gecs, may be downregulated by internalized p. gingivalis. activation of jnk is associated with the invasive process of p. gingivalis.

TI  == adrenomedullin expression in pathogen-challenged oral epithelial cells.
AB  == adrenomedullin, a multifunctional peptide, is expressed by many surface epithelial cells and, previously, we have demonstrated that adrenomedullin has antimicrobial activity. the oral cavity contains an epithelium that is permanently colonized by microflora, yet infections in a host are rare. we exposed oral keratinocytes to whole, live cells from four microorganisms commonly isolated from the oral cavity, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and eikenella corrodens. there was upregulation of protein and gene expression in these cells in response to bacterial suspensions, but not with the yeast, candida albicans. we propose there is a potential role for microbial products in enhancing mucosal defense mechanisms and that adrenomedullin participates in the prevention of local infection, thus contributing to host defense mechanisms.

TI  == discrete protein determinant directs the species-specific adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  == for pathogens to survive in the human oral cavity, they must identify a suitable  niche in the complex multispecies biofilm that exists on oral tissues. the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis adheres to streptococcus gordonii by interacting with a specific region of the streptococcal sspb polypeptide, designated bar. however, it does not adhere to streptococcus mutans, which expresses spap, a highly conserved homolog of sspb. comparison of the predicted secondary structure of bar with the corresponding region of spap suggested that the substitution of asn for gly1182 and val for pro1185 in sspb may confer a unique local structure that is not conserved in spap. a synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids that encompassed residues 1167 to 1193 of sspb promoted avid adherence of p. gingivalis, whereas a peptide derived from the region corresponding to bar in spap was inactive. substitution of gly1182 and pro1185 for asn1182 and val1185 in sspb by site-specific mutation generated proteins that were predicted to assume an spap-like secondary structure, and the purified proteins did not promote p. gingivalis adherence. furthermore, enterococcus faecalis strains expressing the site-specific mutants did not support adherence of p. gingivalis cells. in contrast, p. gingivalis adhered efficiently to e. faecalis strains expressing intact sspb or sspb-spap chimeric proteins containing bar. these results suggest that a region of sspb consisting of 26 amino acids is  sufficient to mediate the adherence of p. gingivalis to s. gordonii and that the  species specificity of adherence arises from its interaction with a discrete structural determinant of sspb that is not conserved in spap.

TI  == evaluation of co-aggregation among streptococcus mitis, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == aims: to develop a semi-quantitative method for evaluating co-aggregation reactions among three bacterial species, and to examine the influence of fusobacterium nucleatum on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis. methods and results: the method involves coating hydroxyapatite (hap) discs with streptococcal cells and treatment with radio-labelled bacterial cell suspensions. the sensitivity of the method was estimated by comparison with a turbidometric co-aggregation assay. results from the two methods were in close agreement. streptococcus mitis-coated hap discs were immersed in a 3h-labelled fus. nucleatum cell suspension and then a 14c-labelled p. gingivalis cell suspension.  the discs were then pyrolysed to recover and quantify the released 3h and 14c radioactivity. the number of fus. nucleatum cells on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. conclusion: the data indicate that the method closely reflects co-aggregation characters, and that fus. nucleatum has a positive effect on the adherence of p. gingivalis. significance and impact of the study: the present method, which is designed to mimic the oral environment, should prove useful in the semi-quantitative evaluation of co-aggregation reactions.

TI  == kappacin, a novel antibacterial peptide from bovine milk.
AB  == caseinomacropeptide (cmp) is a heterogeneous c-terminal fragment (residues 106 to 169) of bovine milk kappa-casein composed of glycosylated and phosphorylated forms of different genetic variants. we have demonstrated that cmp has growth-inhibitory activity against the oral opportunistic pathogens streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and against escherichia coli. cmp was fractionated using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc), and each fraction was tested for activity against s. mutans in a 96-well-plate broth assay. fractions were characterized by n-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. the active form of cmp was shown to be the nonglycosylated, phosphorylated kappa-casein (residues 106 to 169) [kappa-casein(106--169)], which we have designated kappacin. endoproteinase glu-c was used to hydrolyze cmp, and the generated peptides were separated using rp-hplc and gel filtration-hplc and then tested for activity against s. mutans. the peptide ser(p)(149)kappa-casein-a(138--158) was the only peptide generated by endoproteinase glu-c digestion that exhibited growth-inhibitory activity. peptides corresponding to the sequences of the inhibitory peptide ser(p)(149)kappa-casein-a(138--158) and its nonphosphorylated counterpart kappa-casein-a(138--158) were chemically synthesized and tested for antibacterial activity. the synthetic ser(p)(149) kappa-casein-a(138--158) displayed growth-inhibitory activity against s. mutans (mic, 59 microg/ml [26 microm]). the nonphosphorylated peptide, however, did not inhibit growth at the concentrations  tested, indicating that phosphorylation is essential for activity.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == inhibition of epithelial cell apoptosis by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is periodontal pathogen that is capable of invading gingival epithelial cells (gecs). apoptotic responses of primary cultures of gecs to p. gingivalis were investigated with a dna fragmentation elisa assay. p. gingivalis induced a transient increase in gec dna fragmentation; however, after  prolonged incubation gecs did not undergo apoptosis. furthermore, p. gingivalis blocked apoptosis in gecs following stimulation with camptothecin. immunoblotting of gecs with bcl-2 or bax antibodies showed that p. gingivalis up-regulated bcl-2 levels in gecs, whereas bax levels were transiently elevated and declined after 24 h stimulation. streptococcus gordonii did not affect levels of either molecule. rt-pcr demonstrated that induction of bcl-2 occurs at the transcriptional level. the results suggest that p. gingivalis can inhibit apoptosis in gecs by up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic molecule bcl-2. the prevention of host cell apoptosis may represent a strategy for p. gingivalis survival within invaded gecs.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

AB  == objective: to describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. methods: the study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (ap), six localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. results: prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in ap and rpp patients, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella  corrodens were associated with ap, ljp and rpp patients. the other bacterial species, including actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp. and eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. conclusions: the data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different  periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine digluconate and hydrogen peroxide on porphyromonas gingivalis hemin binding and coaggregation with oral streptococci.

TI  == antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  == particulate bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. this material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. the aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (nb), artificial saliva (as) or dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (dmem + 10%fcs), with or without particulate bioglass. all bacteria showed reduced viability following  exposure to bioglass in all the media after 1 h. this antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in  either bm broth or 40% horse serum (hs) in rpmi. a considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. in further experiments it was found that the viability of s. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to nb pre-incubated with bioglass. additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline  solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. moreover, a solution of nb and naoh (of equivalent ph) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with bioglass. thus, particulate bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. this may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.

TI  == membranotropic effects of the antibacterial agent triclosan.
AB  == triclosan is a broad-spectrum hydrophobic antibacterial agent used in dermatological preparations and oral hygiene products. to gain further insight into the mode of action of triclosan we examined its effects on membranes by performing leakage titrations of different oral bacteria and studying its interaction with model membranes through the use of different biophysical techniques. there was negligible efflux of intracellular material from streptococcus sobrinus at the minimal inhibitory concentration of triclosan; whatever leakage did occur commenced only at much higher concentrations. in contrast, no leakage was observed at even the minimal bactericidal concentration  for porphyromonas gingivalis. triclosan decreased the onset temperature of the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-3-[phospho-rac-glycerol] membranes and was immiscible with these lipids in the fluid phase at concentrations greater than 5 mol%. steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements of different phospholipid/triclosan samples using 3-(p-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatrienyl)-phenylpropionic acid were consistent with the calorimetric data. incorporation of increasing amounts of triclosan into 1,2-dielaidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (depe) vesicles induced the nonlamellar h(ii) hexagonal phase at low temperatures and new immiscible phases at temperatures below the main transition of depe. taking these results together  suggests that the antibacterial effects of triclosan are mediated at least in part through its membranotropic effects, resulting in destabilized structures which compromise the functional integrity of cell membranes without inducing cell lysis.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in primary sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the effect of primary sjogren's syndrome (pss) on the microbial flora in the different predilection sites for oral disorders is needed  for planning preventive treatment. we carried out microbial analysis of samples from the dorsum of the tongue, smooth mucosa, supragingival tooth surfaces, and the gingival crevice region of 20 patients with pss. methods: a clinical oral examination was performed and whole unstimulated and stimulated secretion rates were measured. results: compared with healthy controls, subjects with pss harbored higher numbers and frequencies of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans in the supragingival plaque. on the smooth mucosa and  tongue, the pss subjects displayed an increased frequency of c. albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics, and enterococci. c. albicans was detected about  twice as frequently in the supragingival plaque as it was on the tongue. in the gingival crevice region, the pss group harbored slightly lower proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens than controls. the clinical and microbial differences were mainly due to the pss subjects with a stimulated secretion rate of < 0.5 ml/min. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any subject with pss. conclusion: the microbial flora in the different ecosystems reflected the status of oral disorders in the subjects with pss. specific site sampling and analysis in subjects with pss revealed further differences compared  with controls, and is therefore preferable to saliva sampling for oral treatment  planning and for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatment and of preventive measures implemented in individuals with pss.

AB  == fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. type i fimbriae and p pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type ii secretion system. curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. oral pathogens,  such as eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. these fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens have type 4-like  fimbriae, whereas p. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. to date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. the putative major fimbrial subunits, fima and fimp of a. naeslundii and fap1 of s. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. the presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both s. parasanguis and a. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. the model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.

TI  == move of adults with mental retardation from institutions to community-based living: changes in the oral microbiological flora.
AB  == in the western world, the policy of deinstitutionalization and integration of individuals with mental retardation is generally accepted. we tested the hypothesis that de-institutionalization may lead to changes of habits with a potential to influence oral health. when 57 adults with mental retardation moved  from an institution to community-based living, their oral hygiene habits, gingival bleeding, and a three-day food record were registered one month before and 9 and 21 months after the move. mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans  in supragingival plaque, and c. albicans on mucous membranes were analyzed. after 21 months of community-based living, fewer persons showed high classes of mutans  streptococci, growth of p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, and high frequency of sucrose intake, and more subjects showed growth of c. albicans. in a short perspective, the indicators of oral diseases suggest an unchanged or lower risk of oral diseases after the de-institutionalization of individuals with moderate or severe mental retardation.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == investigation on interaction between streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis in specific pathogen-free rats.
AB  == objective: to examine whether endogenous streptococcus can prevent or reduce the  colonization of the virulent porphyromonas gingivalis strain. methods: successful implantation of the endogenous strain of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis 381 within  14 days was demonstrated in the study rats following administration of doxycycline for 7 days. thirty specific pathogen-free (spf) rats were divided into 6 groups. after administration of doxycycline for 7 days, groups a and b were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with p. gingivalis. group c and e were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with s. sanguis. then, group a was inoculated for 5 days with s. sanguis, and rats in group c and d were inoculated  for 5 days with p. gingivalis. group f served as a negative control. after inoculation, the levels of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis in the mouths of the rats were determined at 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 7 days, and 14 days. results: both precolonization of s. sanguis and superinfection with s. sanguis reduced the level of p. gingivalis in experimental rats. however, the reduction was maintained for only 24 to 36 hours. the level of s. sanguis remained stable during the 14-days observation period. conclusion: s. sanguis to function as the  effector strain, the successful implantation of s. sanguis and the antagonistic action efficiently produced in vivo by s. sanguis is required.

TI  == oral immunization with recombinant streptococcus gordonii expressing porphyromonas gingivalis fima domains.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative anaerobe, is implicated in the etiology of adult periodontitis. p. gingivalis fimbriae are one of several critical surface virulence factors involved in both bacterial adherence and inflammation.  p. gingivalis fimbrillin (fima), the major subunit protein of fimbriae, is considered an important antigen for vaccine development against p. gingivalis-associated periodontitis. we have previously shown that biologically active domains of p. gingivalis fimbrillin can be expressed on the surface of the human commensal bacterium streptococcus gordonii. in this study, we examined the  effects of oral coimmunization of germfree rats with two s. gordonii recombinants expressing n (residues 55 to 145)- and c (residues 226 to 337)-terminal epitopes  of p. gingivalis fima to elicit fima-specific immune responses. the effectiveness of immunization in protecting against alveolar bone loss following p. gingivalis  infection was also evaluated. the results of this study show that the oral delivery of p. gingivalis fima epitopes via s. gordonii vectors resulted in the induction of fima-specific serum (immunoglobulin g [igg] and iga) and salivary (iga) antibody responses and that the immune responses were protective against subsequent p. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss. these results support the potential usefulness of the s. gordonii vectors expressing p. gingivalis fimbrillin as a mucosal vaccine against adult periodontitis.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == altered antigenicity in periodontitis patients and decreased adhesion of porphyromonas gingivalis by environmental temperature stress.
AB  == periodontopathogenic bacteria survive various environmental changes during the progression of periodontal disease. alterations in metabolism and protein expression will have to take place to adapt their physiological functions to environmental stress. we examined the effects of an elevation of 2 degrees c in temperature on the adhesive ability and antigenicity of porphyromonas gingivalis. elevation of growth temperature of p. gingivalis from 37 degrees c to 39 degrees  c remarkably suppressed the expression of surface filamentous structures, such as fimbriae, as well as the adhesive capacities to salivary components and streptococcus oralis. sera of severe periodontitis patients revealed a marked increase in serological activity with 39 degrees c cells than with 37 degrees c cells. the alteration of protein profiles of bacterial surface components by temperature elevation was demonstrated by sds-page, and their western blot profiles were also different from those of cells grown at 37 degrees c. although  a uniform trend was not found in the altered patterns, sera from severe periodontitis patients detected more antigenic proteins in cells grown at 39 degrees c than 37 degrees c cells. these observations suggest that p. gingivalis  downregulates the expression of fimbriae and alters its adhesive capacity and antigenicity by the temperature stress that could occur during the disease progression.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

AB  == endodontic sealers that possess both optimum flow ability and antimicrobial properties may theoretically assist in the elimination of microorganisms located  in confined areas of the root canal system. the antimicrobial effects and the flow rate of the following sealers were investigated and compared: kerr pulp canal sealer ewt, grossman's sealer, thermaseal, sealer 26, ah plus, and sealer plus. the agar diffusion test was used to assess the antimicrobial activity of the sealers. in the flow assay, the sealers were placed between two glass slabs and a weight of 500 g was placed on the top of the glass. the diameters of the formed discs were recorded. all root canal sealers tested showed some antimicrobial activity against most of the microorganisms. there were no significant differences between the materials tested (p > 0.05). all root canal sealers also flowed under the conditions of this study. statistical analysis of the results revealed that ah plus and kerr pulp canal sealer ewt had flow values  significantly superior to the other sealers tested (p > 0.05). taken together, these findings suggest that these sealers have the potential to help in the microbial control in the root canal system.

TI  == the sensitivity of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum to different (pseudo)halide-peroxidase combinations compared with mutans streptococci.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  == recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. it has been proposed that dental plaque  bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. in this regard, streptococcus sanguis and p. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. here we report that p. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and trepenoma denticola failed to  aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of p. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. in summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by p. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) p. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.

AB  == background: treatment with titanium dental implants is in general successful. however, an unknown number of implants do not integrate and are removed either by exfoliation or at the time of second stage surgery. it would be of importance to  identify subjects at risk and predict early implant failure. methods: in a retrospective study serum igg antibody titers and avidity in sera from 40 subjects who had experienced titanium dental implant treatments with non-osseo-integration as the outcome (noti) and in sera from 40 age and gender matched control subjects who had received successful titanium dental implants (soti) were studied. serum igg titers to whole cell actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus intermedius sonicated antigen preparations were studied by elisa. results: serum igg antibody titers to s. aureus were significantly higher in subjects with soti than in noti (p<0.001) suggesting that higher titers indicate  protection against implant failure as a result of s. aureus infection. statistically significant higher serum igg antibody avidity to p. gingivalis and  b. forsythus were found in subjects with soti than in subjects with noti (p<0.01  and p<0.001, respectively). statistical analysis failed to demonstrate antibody titer or avidity differences to the other pathogens studied. the likelihood that  soti was associated with a high od reading for s. aureus was 13.1:1 (p<0.001). whether subjects were edentulous or not, or if they had lost teeth because of periodontitis or caries did not seem to matter. conclusion: serum igg antibodies  relative to b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and s. aureus may be associated with the  outcome of implant procedures and explain why early implant failures occur.

TI  == intergeneric communication in dental plaque biofilms.
AB  == dental plaque is a complex biofilm that accretes in a series of discrete steps proceeding from a gram-positive streptococcus-rich biofilm to a structure rich in gram-negative anaerobes. this study investigated information flow between two unrelated plaque bacteria, streptococcus cristatus and porphyromonas gingivalis.  a surface protein of s. cristatus caused repression of the p. gingivalis fimbrial gene (fima), as determined by a chromosomal fima promoter-lacz reporter construct and by reverse transcription-pcr. signaling activity was associated with a 59-kda surface protein of s. cristatus and showed specificity for the fima gene. furthermore, p. gingivalis was unable to form biofilm microcolonies with s. cristatus. thus, s. cristatus is capable of modulating virulence gene expression  in p. gingivalis, consequently influencing the development of pathogenic plaque.

TI  == identification of a porphyromonas gingivalis receptor for the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein.
AB  == colonization of the plaque biofilm by the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis  is favored by the presence of antecedent organisms such as streptococcus gordonii. coadhesion between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii can be mediated by the sspb protein of s. gordonii; however, the p. gingivalis cognate receptor for this protein has not been identified. in this study, we identified a surface protein of p. gingivalis that interacts with the sspb protein. coprecipitation between p. gingivalis outer membrane proteins and purified sspb protein demonstrated that a  100-kda p. gingivalis protein bound to sspb. the 100-kda protein also bound to an engineered strain of enterococcus faecalis that expresses the sspb protein on the cell surface. monospecific polyclonal antibodies to the 100-kda protein inhibited the binding between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii in a dose-dependent manner up to 86%. amino acid sequencing of the 100-kda protein showed homology to a protein previously identified as the p. gingivalis minor fimbria. the minor fimbrial protein may exist as a complex with a hemagglutinin-like protein since the genes  encoding these proteins are adjacent on the chromosome and are cotranscribed. thus, the p. gingivalis receptor for s. gordonii sspb is a 100-kda protein that structurally may be a minor fimbria-protein complex and functionally effectuates  coadhesion.

AB  == with the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. we report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the  optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. in particular, the pathogenic gram-positive porphyrin producing atcc strains propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces odontolyticus and porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin ix. in addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mw/cm2 light intensity and 360 j/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. the survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/-  0.10 in porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. no photoeffect was found for the bacterium streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species prevotella intermedia. taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.

AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == antibody-targeted lethal photosensitization of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that porphyromonas gingivalis is susceptible to killing by toluidine blue o (tbo) when irradiated with light from a helium-neon (hene) laser. the aim of this study was to determine whether a tbo-antibody conjugate (ab-tbo) could be used to specifically target p. gingivalis to lethal photosensitization in the presence of streptococcus sanguis or human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs). when a mixture of p. gingivalis and s. sanguis was exposed to 4 microg of tbo/ml and irradiated with hene laser light, there were 1.5- and 4.0-log(10)-unit reductions in the viable counts, respectively. in contrast, when tbo was conjugated with a murine monoclonal antibody against p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, the reductions in viable counts of p. gingivalis and s. sanguis amounted to 5.0 and 0.1 log(10) units, respectively. lethal photosensitization of p. gingivalis in the presence of hgfs using unconjugated tbo resulted in a 0.7-log(10)-unit reduction in p. gingivalis viable counts and a 99% reduction in the incorporation of tritiated thymidine ([(3)h]tdr) by the hgfs. in contrast, when the ab-tbo conjugate was used, there was a 100% reduction in p. gingivalis viable counts but no significant reduction in the incorporation  of [(3)h]tdr by hgfs. these results demonstrate that specific targeting of p. gingivalis can be achieved using tbo conjugated to a monoclonal antibody raised against a cell surface component of this organism.

TI  == effect of the interleukin-1 genotype on monocyte il-1beta expression in subjects  with adult periodontitis.
AB  == an association has been reported between polymorphisms in the genes encoding il-1alpha (-889) and il-1beta (+3953) (periodontitis susceptibility trait, pst),  and an increased severity of periodontitis (18). the il-1beta polymorphism was reported to correlate with increased il-1beta expression by monocytes in response to bacterial stimulants. in the present study, we determined if pst positive subjects with periodontitis exhibit elevated production of il-1beta, compared to  pst negative periodontitis patients. peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from 10 pst+ and 10 pst- age- and disease-balanced subjects with adult forms of periodontitis. monocytes were cultured with a panel of bacterial stimulants, including escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis lps, and whole formalinized periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and prevotella intermedia, and health-associated organisms veillonella parvula and streptococcus sanguis. our results demonstrate that monocytes from pst+ and pst-  patients showed no significant differences in il-1beta production in response to  any stimulant tested. in addition, the periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. intermedia failed to stimulate higher il-1beta responses compared to health-associated species v. parvula and s. sanguis. a marked interindividual variation in production of il-1beta was seen, with high, low and  intermediate responders present in both pst+ and pst- groups. we conclude that genetic loci other than the pst polymorphisms are also important regulators of monocyte il-1 responses.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == environmental conditions modulate the expression of the sspa and sspb genes in streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == the sspa and sspb surface proteins of streptococcus gordonii are multifunctional  adhesins encoded by tandemly arranged genes. the transcriptional regulation of the sspa and sspb genes was investigated by generating chromosomal promoter- cat  gene fusions and measuring cat enzyme activity. the sspa promoter was found to be three-fold more active than the sspb promoter. in addition, sspa transcriptional  activity increased throughout growth, whereas sspb activity decreased in stationary phase. promoter activity of both sspa and sspb was regulated in response to temperature, ph and osmolarity; however the two promoters showed a different pattern of regulation. changes in promoter activity were reflected in levels of surface protein and in adherence of s. gordonii to porphyromonas gingivalis, a phenotypic property dependent on ssp proteins. the results show that s. gordonii strain dl1 differentially regulates sspa and sspb transcription  in response to oral environmental cues, suggesting that the sspa and sspb polypeptides may have distinct functional roles in cell adherence to oral substrates.

TI  == interleukin-1 receptor signaling rather than that of tumor necrosis factor is critical in protecting the host from the severe consequences of a polymicrobe anaerobic infection.
AB  == infection of the dental pulp leads to an osteolytic lesion that results from a polymicrobial infection consisting largely of pathogenic anaerobes. infection causes significant morbidity and mortality mediated by bacterial factors and in some cases by the up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), in particular, play a complex and central role in the responses to microbial pathogens. however, relatively little is known about the significance of these cytokines in protecting the host from focal polymicrobial anaerobic infections. to establish the relative importance of il-1 and tnf in mediating the response to a mixed anaerobic infection, we inoculated the dental pulp of mice with six anaerobic pathogens containing functional deletions of receptors to il-1 (il-1r1(-/-)), tnf (tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-)), or both (tnfrp55(-/-)-il-1ri(-/-)). the results indicate that il-1 receptor signaling and tnf receptor signaling both play similarly important roles in protecting the host from local tissue damage. however, il-1 receptor signaling is considerably more important than tnf receptor signaling in  preventing the spread of infection into surrounding fascial planes, since il-1r1(-/-) but not tnfrp55(-/-)-p75(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher morbidity and mortality. moreover, all of the fatal infections occurred in male mice, suggesting the importance of gender differences in limiting the impact of these infections.

TI  == effect of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse on induction of platelet aggregation by oral bacteria in vitro.
AB  == background: with an increasing body of data suggesting an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, studies have been conducted to elucidate potential mechanisms by which oral bacteria might exert systemic effects. 2 oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis, have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. this study was conducted to determine the effect of treatment with an essential oil mouthrinse (listerine  antiseptic) on the platelet-aggregating activity of these organisms. method: bacteria were grown under standard culture conditions. s. sanguis atcc strain 10556 was exposed for 3 min to the essential oil mouthrinse at either full strength or a 1:1 dilution, while p. gingivalis fdc strain 381 was exposed to the essential oil mouthrinse at a 1:10 dilution. positive control cells were treated  with hanks balanced salt solution (hbss). aggregation was measured using a recording platelet aggregometer. the assay of each organism in its respective mouthrinse dilution(s) or hbss was repeated 5 times. results: in all cases, the hbss-treated organisms induced platelet aggregation, with mean(+/-s.e.) lag times of 12.30 (+/-1.36) min and 11.36 (+/-0.58) min for p. gingivalis and s. sanguis,  respectively. in contrast, treatment with the essential oil mouthrinse completely inhibited the platelet aggregating activity of p. gingivalis and of s. sanguis exposed to the 1:1 mouthrinse dilution in all assays; the aggregating activity of s. sanguis treated with full-strength mouthrinse was completely inhibited in 4 of 5 assays, and inhibited by 75% in the 5th, for a mean inhibition of 95 +/- 1.5%.  conclusion: this study provides additional evidence that the essential oil mouthrinse can interfere with bacterial cell surface-associated activities which  may have clinical relevance.

TI  == large-scale synthesis and functional elements for the antimicrobial activity of defensins.
AB  == human neutrophil defensins, and their analogues incorporating anionic, hydrophobic or cationic residues at the n- and c-termini, were synthesized by solid-phase procedures. the synthetic defensins were examined for their microbicidal activity against candida albicans, two gram-negative bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) and two gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans). the human neutrophil peptide 1 (hnp1) and hnp2 were found to be potent candidacidal agents. hnp3, which differs by one amino acid at the n-terminus of its sequence,  was totally inactive. the gram-negative bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans and p.  gingivalis and the gram-positive bacteria s. gordonii and s. mutans were insensitive to human defensins. however, the insertion of two basic residues, such as arginine, at both the n-terminus and the c-terminus of hnp2 significantly enhanced antifungal and antibacterial activity. the addition of anionic residues, such as aspartic acid, at the n- and c-termini rendered the molecule totally inactive. the presence of two hydrophobic amino acids, such as valine, at the n-terminus of hnp2 and of two basic arginine residues at its c-terminus resulted  in molecules that were optimally active against these oral pathogens. the results suggest that the n- and c-terminal residues in defensin peptides are the crucial  functional elements that determine their microbicidal potency. the three-dimensional structure of all defensins constitutes the same amphiphilic beta-sheet structure, with the polar face formed by the n- and c-terminal residues playing an important role in defining microbicidal potency and the antimicrobial spectrum. the enhanced microbicidal activity observed for defensin  peptides with two basic residues at both the n- and c-termini could be due to optimization of the amphiphilicity of the structure, which could facilitate specific interactions with the microbial membranes.

TI  == namibian chewing stick, diospyros lycioides, contains antibacterial compounds against oral pathogens.
AB  == the twigs of diospyros lycioides, a plant commonly known as "muthala", are frequently used as chewing sticks for the cleaning of teeth by rural and urban people in namibia. preliminary studies showed that a methanol extract of d. lycioides inhibited growth of selected oral pathogens. subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of four novel bioactive naphthalene glycosides, diospyrosides a, b, c, and d (1-4), and two known bioactive naphthoquinones, juglone (5) and 7-methyljuglone (6). the structures of the new compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic techniques including 1d and 2d nmr. these compounds inhibited the growth of oral cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis) and periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) at minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.019 to 1.25 mg/ml. juglone exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity among these compounds.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  == accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. in subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from gram-negative bacteria increases. as the gingival junctional epithelium (je) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of ltas (from streptococcus mutans and s. sanguis) and lpss (from  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (hacat and erm) and  a culture model for human je. the cells were exposed to the ltas or lpss (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. none of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the je cultures. however, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in  all cultures treated with ltas. in contrast, lpss showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. this suggests that lpss, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. however, the ltas appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal je and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == coinvasion of dentinal tubules by porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii depends upon binding specificity of streptococcal antigen i/ii adhesin.
AB  == cell wall-anchored polypeptides of the antigen i/ii family are produced by many species of oral streptococci. these proteins mediate adhesion of streptococci to  salivary glycoproteins and to other oral microorganisms and promote binding of cells to collagen type i and invasion of dentinal tubules. since infections of the root canal system have a mixed anaerobic bacterial etiology, we investigated  the hypothesis that coadhesion of anaerobic bacteria with streptococci may facilitate invasive endodontic disease. porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 cells were able to invade dentinal tubules when cocultured with streptococcus gordonii  dl1 (challis) but not when cocultured with streptococcus mutans ng8. an isogenic  noninvasive mutant of s. gordonii, with production of sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family) polypeptides abrogated, was deficient in binding to collagen and had a 40% reduced ability to support adhesion of p. gingivalis. heterologous expression of the s. mutans spap (antigen i/ii) protein in this mutant restored collagen binding and tubule invasion but not adhesion to p. gingivalis or the ability to promote p. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. an isogenic afimbrial mutant of p. gingivalis had 50% reduced binding to s. gordonii cells but was unaffected in the ability to coinvade dentinal tubules with s. gordonii wild-type cells. expression of the s. gordonii sspa or sspb polypeptide on the surface of lactococcus lactis  cells endowed these bacteria with the abilities to bind p. gingivalis, penetrate  dentinal tubules, and promote p. gingivalis coinvasion of dentin. the results demonstrate that collagen-binding and p. gingivalis-binding properties of antigen i/ii polypeptides are discrete functions. specificity of antigen i/ii polypeptide recognition accounts for the ability of p. gingivalis to coinvade dentinal tubules with s. gordonii but not with s. mutans. this provides evidence that the  specificity of interbacterial coadhesion may influence directly the etiology of pulpal and periapical diseases.

AB  == the dodecapepetide sequence r-l-c-r-i-v-v-i-r-v-c-r with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by cd and determined by two-dimensional (2d) nmr. the strains p. gingivalis (w50 and 381), a. actinomycetemcomitans (y4 and 67), s. gordonii (dl1), and s. mutans (gs5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microm concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. the weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the cd spectra of this peptide provides evidence for  the presence of a disulfide bridge. the negative n-pi* band at approximately 200  nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. the negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. the assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2d total correlated and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy. the temperature dependence of amide nh chemical shifts and (1)h-(2)h exchange effect on amide nh resonances indicate the involvement of amide nh groups of cys3, ile5, ile8, val10, and arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen  bonding. the coupling constant (j(nh-c(alpha)h)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear overhauser effects, and the results of restrained  structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications  provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type i (iii) beta-turn  involving ile5, val6, val7, and ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the n-terminal arg1, leu2, cys3, and val4 and the c-terminal arg9, val10, cys11,  and arg12 residues. the structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

AB  == background: while streptococcus mutans and actinomyces spp are considered to be major pathogenic microorganisms of root caries, their roles in the degradation of organic matrix components of human root dentin need clarification. methods: ten laboratory strains and 11 clinical isolates of mutans streptococci and actinomyces species, and positive bacterial or purified enzyme controls (porphyromonas gingivalis whole cell lysates, trypsin or clostridial collagenase) were used to establish the degradation of azocollagen (ac), insoluble type i collagen (ic) or human dentin collagen (dc) from dentin powder in two types of experiments investigating collagenolytic activity either during or after bacterial growth. ultraviolet-irradiated dentin powder and gamma-irradiated ic were used to assess the collagenolytic activity of test strains during bacterial  growth. ac, ic and acid-treated dentin powder were used to determine the collagenolytic activity of sonicated bacterial whole cells and cell-free culture  supernatants recovered from test strains after growth. hydroxyproline or spectrophotometric assays were used to analyze the level of degraded collagen. results: data from this study showed that in contrast to the positive controls, none of the laboratory strains or clinical isolates elicited significant degradation of ac, ic or dc. conclusions: results indicated that mutans streptococci and actinomyces species had no significant collagenolytic activity,  but may be involved in the root caries process through other mechanisms. in addition, proteolytic enzymes from other oral bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis or from host cells such as neutrophils may also participate in the pathogenesis of root caries.

AB  == background: chlamydia pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and recently, periodontal disease, have been associated with human atherosclerosis. porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus sanguis are major pathogens associated with periodontitis, a common chronic inflammatory condition in adults. investigators have found that these infectious agents may influence vascular cell functions by inducing thrombus formation, vascular cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell death. methods and results: the main purpose of our study was to investigate the relation between the presence of multiple infectious agents in human carotid endarterectomy specimens and pathoanatomic features of the corresponding carotid plaques. histologically, plaque rupture of the fibrous cap  and communication of the luminal thrombus with the central necrotic lipid core was seen in or at proximity to the macrophage-rich shoulder (unstable plaque region). thrombus within the lipid core without plaque rupture was occasionally found near the internal elastic lamina, associated with increased vascularity and lymphocytic infiltrate. apoptosis, as detected by both the immunohistochemical staining of apoptosis-related proteins and in situ labeling of internucleosomally degraded dna, was common in atherosclerotic plaques. immunostainings for c pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, p gingivalis, and s sanguis  were positive in the carotid plaques. from 1 to 4 organisms were found in the same specimen. the micro-organisms were immunolocalized in plaque shoulders and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, associated with ulcer and thrombus formation, and adjacent to areas of strong labeling for apoptotic bodies. conclusions: our data  provide evidence that multiple infectious agents may be found in atherosclerotic  plaques, and sometimes in the same specimen. the current study is the first to report the detection of 2 major odontopathogens, p gingivalis and s sanguis, in atherosclerotic plaques. the immunolocalization of these micro-organisms within unstable plaque regions and their association with plaque ulceration, thrombosis, and apoptosis in vascular cells are intriguing. multiple infectious agents may alter vascular cell function and provide a "trigger" for acute ischemic stroke events. further evidence from human studies and animal models will be needed.

TI  == an evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == secretion of functional salivary peptide by streptococcus gordonii which inhibits fimbria-mediated adhesion of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a putative periodontopathogen, can bind to human salivary components with its fimbriae. we have previously shown that fimbriae specifically bind to a peptide domain shared by a major salivary component, i.e., proline-rich (glyco)proteins (prps). the synthetic domain peptide prp-c (pprp-c)  significantly inhibits the fimbrial binding to prps. in this study, a recombinant strain of streptococcus gordonii secreting pprp-c was generated as a model of a possible approach to prevent the oral colonization by the pathogen. a duplicate dna fragment (prpc) encoding pprp-c was obtained by self-complementary annealing  of synthetic oligonucleotides. prpc was connected downstream to a promoter and a  gene encoding a signal peptide of streptococcus downei glucosyltransferase i in frame. the linked fragments were inserted into the plasmid pmnk-4 derived from pva838. the constructed plasmid was inserted to produce the transformant s. gordonii g9b, which then successfully secreted recombinant pprp-c (r-pprp-c) of the expected size. the concentrated bacterial culture supernatant containing r-pprp-c inhibited the binding of p. gingivalis cells and fimbriae to prp1 in a dose-dependent manner up to 72 and 77%, respectively. the r-pprp-c concentrate also inhibited the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with various streptococcal strains as effectively as synthetic pprp-c in a dose-dependent manner. collectively, pprp-c was found to be able to prevent p. gingivalis adherence to salivary receptor protein and plaque-forming bacteria. these results suggest that this recombination approach with a nonperiodontopathic bacterium may be suitable  for the therapeutic prevention of p. gingivalis adherence to the oral cavity.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == background: this investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (ha) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. the rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that ha can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. methods: in this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant ha (low, 141 kd; medium, 757 kd; and high, 1,300 kd) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. three concentrations of each ha formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. results: recombinant ha exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (mw) and concentration. the high concentrations of the medium mw ha had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella oris, staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes strains. the 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high mw ha had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. among the bacterial strains studied, ha was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. conclusions: the results of this study suggest that ha in the mw range of 1,300 kd may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds  when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.

TI  == expression of saliva-binding epitopes of the porphyromonas gingivalis fima protein on the surface of streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative oral anaerobic bacterium, has been implicated in the onset and development of periodontitis. the p. gingivalis fimbriae which mediate bacterial adherence to host oral sites and induce host inflammatory responses have been suggested as a potential antigen candidate. for  vaccine development. this study was undertaken to generate streptococcus gordonii vectors expressing the major subunit protein (fima) of p. gingivalis fimbriae for testing as a potential live vaccine against periodontitis. we report here the expression of the c-terminal saliva-binding epitopes of p. gingivalis fima on the surface of s. gordonii and demonstrate that domains containing free cysteine residues are poorly expressed on the surface of s. gordonii.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel cysteine proteinase (periodontain) from porphyromonas gingivalis. evidence for a role in the inactivation of human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor.
AB  == periodontal disease is characterized by inflammation of the periodontium manifested by recruitment of neutrophils, which can degranulate, releasing powerful proteinases responsible for destruction of connective tissues, and eventual loss of tooth attachment. although the presence of host proteinase inhibitors (serpins) should minimize tissue damage by endogenous proteinases, this is not seen clinically, and it has been speculated that proteolytic inactivation of serpins may contribute to progression of the disease. a major pathogen associated with periodontal disease is the gram-negative anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and in this report, we describe a novel proteinase that has been isolated from culture supernatants of this organism that is capable of inactivating the human serpin, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, the primary endogenous regulator of human neutrophil elastase. this new enzyme, referred to as periodontain, belongs to the cysteine proteinase family based on inhibition studies and exists as a 75-kda heterodimer. furthermore, periodontain shares significant homology to streptopain, a proteinase from streptococcus pyogenes, and prtt, a putative proteinase from p. gingivalis. clearly, the presence of this enzyme, which rapidly inactivates alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, could result in elevated levels of human neutrophil elastase clinically detected in periodontal disease and should be considered as a potential virulence factor for p. gingivalis.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

TI  == the microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  == this study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (nr-group; 11 participants) or responsive (r-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. microbiological samples from three types  of pocket (< 4 mm deep a-samples; 4-5 mm b-samples; > 5 mm c-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. actinomyces naeslundii, a. israelii, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. the periodontitis pathogens bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium spp, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the a- and b-samples of  both patient groups and in the c-samples of the r-group. in the c-samples of the  nr-group their mean counts were 45%. correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the c-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. the results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.

TI  == the importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  == cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization  of various oral bacterial species. bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an  important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. the properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance.  among others, porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. the fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kda fimbrillin proteins. dna sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fima) from nine strains of p. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fima, while retaining common  immunochemical specificities. p. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is  known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. fimbriae of prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. these fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface  and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == neutrophil response and microbiological findings around teeth and dental implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the neutrophil response, measured as both functional and antigenic elastase, around teeth and titanium implants and to relate these findings to the microbiota. the 31 patients included in the study had been treated successfully for total or partial edentulism with titanium implants. crevicular fluid and microbiological samples were taken from 3 sites: 1) crevices around teeth and 2) implants in 16 partially edentulous patients and  3) crevices around implants in 15 edentulous patients. all sites sampled showed similar degrees of inflammation assessed by gingival index and total protein concentration. the samples were analyzed for elastase activity and immunoreactive elastase. the elastase activity was significantly higher in crevices surrounding  implants in partially edentulous patients compared with implants in edentulous patients. the antigenic elastase showed no difference among the 3 sites. gram-positive cocci were the main bacterial species in all 3 groups. edentulous patients tended to have lower frequency of black pigmenting anaerobes. no correlation of analyzed bacteria and elastase activity was found between the 3 sites. this study indicates that, despite a similar appearance of clinical parameters and absence of significant differences in the microbiota, the inflammation around implants in partially edentulous patients induces a stronger  neutrophil response than does the inflammation around implants in edentulous patients.

TI  == microbiological features and crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity in early onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (ast) is one of the components of gcf that is released as a result of cell death. in this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (eop) patients were first examined for the ast levels in gcf by the periogard periodontal tissue monitor. to be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 ast positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (ast+, cic+)  and 1 ast negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (ast-, cic-). in 15 eop patients who met the entry criteria, 30 ast+, cic+ sites (1st group) and 19 ast-, cic- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. certain microbial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. parallel to the ast levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). within the scope of this study, ast activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. these findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of  the ast test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those  that are inflamed, but not progressing.

AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to assess co2 laser ability to eliminate bacteria from titanium implant surfaces. the changes of the surface  structure, the rise in temperature, and the damage of connective tissue cells after laser irradiation were also considered. study design/materials and methods: streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis on titanium discs were irradiated by an expanded beam of co2 laser. surface alteration was observed by a light, and a scanning electron, microscope. temperature was measured with a thermograph. damage of fibroblastic (l-929) and osteoblastic (mc3t3-e1) cells outside the irradiation spot and adhesion of the cells to the irradiated area were also estimated. results: all the organisms (10(8)) of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis were killed by the irradiation at 286 j/cm2 and 245 j/cm2, respectively. furthermore, laser irradiation did not cause surface alteration, rise of temperature, serious damage of connective tissue cells located outside the irradiation spot, or inhibition of cell adhesion to the irradiated area. conclusion: co2 laser irradiation with expanded beam may be useful in removing bacterial contaminants from implant surface.

TI  == microorganisms in closed periapical lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the microorganisms of strictly selected closed periapical lesions associated with both refractory endodontic therapy and pulpal calcification. definitive criteria were established that assured complete clinical isolation of the periapical lesion from the oral and periodontal environment. a total of 13 criteria-referenced lesions were selected  from 70 patients with endodontic surgical indications. a well controlled culturing method was used in all cases and samples were taken by one clinician at three separate sites during each surgery. samples taken at the surgical window and within the body of the lesion served as controls, whilst a third sample was taken at the apex. in all 13 cases, samples taken from the apex yielded microorganisms comprising 63.6% obligate anaerobes and 36.4% facultative anaerobes. prevalence of the isolated species was 31.8% for actinomyces sp., 22.7% propionibacterium sp., 18.2% streptococcus sp., 13.6% staphlyococcus sp., 4.6% porphyromonas gingivalis, 4.6% peptostreptococcus micros and 4.6% gram-negative enterics. the results of this investigation indicate that closed periapical lesions associated with calcified teeth or those resistant to root canal treatment harbour bacteria. the inability to eradicate all root canal microorganisms during root canal treatment, along with anatomical factors, may allow further bacterial colonization of the root apex and surrounding periapical  tissues, and consequently prevent healing.

TI  == biofilm formation by porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm) was used to visualize and quantify biofilm formation by the oral bacteria streptococcus gordonii and porphyromonas gingivalis. a saliva-coated glass coverslip under continuous bacterial challenge  and conditions of low shear force was used to investigate attachment to the salivary pellicle and also the effect of cell-cell interactions on the extent of  colonization and biofilm development. s. gordonii bound to the salivary pellicle  and outcompeted p. gingivalis for attachment sites. both p. gingivalis and s. gordonii failed to establish substantial biofilm formation independently. however, biofilm formation did occur subsequent to initial adherence of p. gingivalis to s. gordonii cells deposited on the salivary pellicle. the commensal species s. gordonii may, therefore, provide an attachment substrate for colonization and biofilm accretion by the potential pathogen, p. gingivalis.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

TI  == dental plaque, platelets, and cardiovascular diseases.
AB  == cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia, occur as a result of a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. during periodontitis, dental plaque microorganisms may disseminate through the blood to  infect the vascular endothelium and contribute to the occurrence of atherosclerosis and risk of myocardial ischemia and infarction. myocardial ischemia and infarction are often preceded by acute thromboembolic events. in an  in vitro model of thrombosis, certain dental plaque bacteria induce platelets to  aggregate. aggregation of platelets is induced by the platelet aggregation-associated protein [paapj expressed on plaque bacteria, including streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis. intravenous infusion of s. sanguis into rabbits has been shown previously to cause changes in the electrocardiogram (ecg), heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility. these changes are consistent with the occurrence of myocardial infarction. the ecg changes are now shown to begin within 30 seconds after infusion of paap+ s. sanguis, followed by alterations in blood pressure and respiratory rate. these changes occurred intermittently over a 30-minute period and changed within one heartbeat to a normal pattern and suddenly back to abnormal. intermittent ecg abnormalities were seen in 13 of 15 rabbits, including left axis deviation, st-segment depression, preventricular contractions, alternans, and bigemnia. dose-dependent thrombocytopenia, accumulation of 111indium-labeled platelets in the lungs, and tachypnea also occurred. no changes occurred with the paap- strain. the data indicated that papp+ s. sanguis interacts with circulating platelets, inducing thromboemboli to cause the pulmonary and cardiac abnormalities. during periodontitis, therefore, paap+ s. sanguis and p. gingivalis bacteremia may contribute to the chance of acute thromboembolic events.

TI  == oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == bactericidal activity and poly-l-proline ii conformation of the tandem repeat sequence of human salivary mucin glycoprotein (mg2).
AB  == the tandem repeat 23-residue sequence [trs23 (145-167): t-t-a-a-p-p-t-p-s-a-t-t-p-a-p-p-s-s-s-a-p-p-e] of human salivary mucin glycoprotein mg2 was examined for its in vitro bactericidal activity against four oral microorganisms, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus mutans. the conformational  features of the proline-rich peptide were determined by circular dichroism (cd) and 600 mhz two-dimensional (2d) nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) in aqueous solution. the strains of p. gingivalis (w50 and 381), a. actinomycetemcomitans (y4 and 67), s. gordonii (dl1), and s. mutans (gs5) are highly sensitive to this  peptide at 1.5-3.0 microm concentrations, suggesting that the proline-rich repeat sequence is a potent bactericidal agent for oral pathogens. the assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances was accomplished by the combined analysis of 2d total correlated spectroscopy and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy. the temperature dependence of amide nh chemical shifts and the 1h-2h exchange effect on amide nh resonances suggest the absence of intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded nh groups. the coupling constant (jnh-calphah) values, conformational restriction offered by the proline residues (phi = -60 degrees +/- 15 degrees), the set of medium- and short-range nuclear overhauser effects observed for this sequence, and the results of restrained structure calculation using diana, the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications, provide evidence for the existence of a significant population of poly-l-proline  ii-type helices in aqueous solution. the cd spectra of the peptide in phosphate buffer (ph 7.2) and in methanol are reminiscent of the cd spectrum of the poly-l-proline ii helical conformation and are consistent with the nmr data. the  bactericidal activity of the proline-rich repeat sequence suggests that bacterial colonization, facilitated by the adsorbed salivary mucins on tooth surface, could be partly controlled and cleared by proteolytically degraded proline-rich peptides of mg2 in saliva before the colonized organisms turn into pathogens. it  appears that the poly-l-proline ii helix is the biologically active backbone conformation for bactericidal activity of the tandem repeat sequences of salivary mg2.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

TI  == the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses in oral health care.
AB  == there is growing public recognition of the importance of oral health, as symbolized by the theme. "oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  == this investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. the % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. commonly detected species, such as actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. mean % of sites (+/-sem) colonized by bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. the odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when b. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. mean prevalence for porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2  (p<0.001) and for selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with pd 0-4 mm were analyzed. the data suggest an etiologic role for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and s. noxia in adult periodontitis.

TI  == binaphthalenone glycosides from african chewing sticks, diospyros lycioides.
AB  == our laboratory has engaged in the exploration of active antimicrobial principles  present in chewing sticks commonly used by the african and middle eastern countries as a mechanical oral hygiene aid in place of tooth brushing. during this investigation, a methanol extract from the twigs of diospyros lycioides, a namibia tooth cleaning stick, demonstrated antimicrobial activity against common  oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis (mics  2.5 and 0.156 mg/ml). subsequent fractionation and purification of this extract led to the identification of two novel binaphathalenone glycosides: 1', 2-binaphthalen-4-one-2',3-dimethyl-1,8'-epoxy-1,4',5,5',8, 8'-hexahydroxy-8-o-beta-glucopyranosyl-5'-o-beta-xylopyranosyl(1-- >6) -beta-glucopyranoside (1) and 1',2-binaphthalen-4-one-2', 3-dimethyl-1,8'-epoxy-1,4',5,5',8,8'-hexahydroxy-5', 8-di-o-beta-xylopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-glucopyranoside (2). their structures were  established using spectroscopic techniques. examination of the antimicrobial activity of these two compounds revealed positive but only marginal growth inhibition against the test cariogenic pathogens, s. sanguis and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == periodontal status and serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms in sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. rapid bacterial plaque accumulation occurs in sjogren's syndrome patients due to decreases in salivary flow rate. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome  and evaluate serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including  major periodontopathogens, compared to healthy controls. seventeen sjogren's syndrome patients and 14 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque (pl), sulcular bleeding (sbi), periodontal index scores (pi), probing depths (pd), and total number of teeth were recorded. an elisa was used to determine the serum igg antibody level to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms. significantly higher pl, sbi, pd, and pi scores, as well as an increased number of lost teeth were observed in patients with sjogren's syndrome compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to streptococcus oralis were significantly lower in sjogren's syndrome patients than controls (p <0.0002). these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis compared to controls (p <0.006 to 0.0004). our findings indicate that sjogren's syndrome patients have established periodontal disease and serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms previously identified as periodontopathogens in systemically healthy subjects. these results suggest that sjogren's syndrome may affect bacterial colonization in plaque and contribute to increased periodontal disease in this compromised population.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == microbiota of health, gingivitis, and initial periodontitis.
AB  == this study compared the subgingival microbiota in periodontal health, gingivitis  and initial periodontitis using predominant culture and a dna probe, checkerboard hybridization method. 56 healthy adult subjects with minimal periodontal attachment loss were clinically monitored at 3-month intervals for 12 months. more sites demonstrated small increments of attachment loss than attachment gain  over the monitoring period. sites, from 17 subjects, showing > or = 1.5 mm periodontal attachment loss during monitoring were sampled as active lesions for  microbial analysis. twelve subjects demonstrated interproximal lesions, and 5 subjects had attachment loss at buccal sites (recession). cultural studies identified bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and selenomonas noxia as  the predominant species associated with active interproximal lesions (9 subjects), whereas actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis, were the dominant species colonizing buccal active sites. a. naeslundii, campylobacter gracilis, and b. forsythus (at lower levels than active sites) were the dominant  species cultured from gingivitis (10 subjects). health-associated species (10 subjects) included streptococcus oralis, a. naeslundii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. dna probe data identified higher mean levels of b. forsythus and c. rectus with active (7 subjects) compared to inactive periodontitis sites. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were detected infrequently. cluster analysis of the cultural microbiota grouped 8/9 active interproximal lesions in one subcluster characterized by a mostly gram-negative microbiota, including b. forsythus and c. rectus. the data suggest that b. forsythus c. rectus and s. noxia were major species characterizing sites converting from periodontal health to disease. the differences in location and microbiota of interproximal and buccal active sites suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in increased attachment loss.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and hiv infection status.
AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  == the present study evaluated the long-term effect of (i) meticulous self-performed, supragingival plaque control and (ii) the use of a triclosan/copolymer containing dentifrice in adult subjects susceptible to destructive periodontitis. 40 individuals were recruited into the trial. 3-5 years prior to the baseline examination, they had all been treated by nonsurgical means- for advanced periodontal disease. during the subsequent maintenance phase, all subjects had at different time intervals exhibited sites with recurrent periodontitis. at a baseline examination, 6 surfaces per tooth were examined regarding bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level. the deepest pocket site in each quadrant (i.e. 4 sites per subject) was selected and samples of the subgingival bacteria were taken. at baseline, all volunteers received detailed information on proper oral hygiene techniques. this  information was repeated on an individual need basis during the course of the subsequent 36-months. no professional subgingival therapy was delivered between the baseline and the 36-month examinations. the subjects were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups of 20 individuals each, 1 test and 1 control group. the members of the test group were supplied with a fluoridated dentifrice  containing triclosan/copolymer (total, colgate), while the controls received a corresponding dentifrice but without triclosan/copolymer. the findings demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, carefully practiced supragingival plaque control had some effects on the subgingival microbiota, but also that this was insufficient to prevent disease progression. in a corresponding group of subjects, however, who used a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice, the subgingival microbiota was reduced in both quantitative and qualitative terms and recurrent periodontitis was almost entirely prevented.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == reduced serum igg reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in hiv-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  == serum samples were obtained from 44 hiv-seropositive (hiv+) and 37 hiv-seronegative (hiv-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. serum igg and iga reactivities towards streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of elisa. hiv+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower igg reactivities to the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum as compared  with their hiv- counterparts (p < 0.05). specific serum iga reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for p. nigrescens where the hiv+  group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). the results indicate that hiv infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in hiv-infected patients.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == anti-bacterial action of onion (allium cepa l.) extracts against oral pathogenic  bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the focus was on the antibacterial activity of onions. this study  researched the activities of onion extracts on streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, the main causal bacteria for dental caries, and porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, considered to be the main causal bacteria of adult periodontitis. the results showed that the onion extracts possess an effect on all test bacterial strains (s.mutans jc-2, s. sobrinus omz176, p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and p. intermedia atcc 25611), and the  effects were bactericidal against cultured and resting bacterial cells. the activity of the onion extracts was stable even after 48 hours in the culture medium. this result suggests that no decomposition or volatility of onion extracts occurred in the culture medium. the antibacterial activity of onion extracts was not markedly influenced by cysteine (10 mm) treatment. however, activity significantly decreased with alkali treatment. grated onion left to stand at 37 degrees c for 48 hours did not show antibacterial activity. also, activity of steam treated (100 degrees c, 10 min.) onion was not observed. using  avicel plate by thin layer chromatography with the solvent of n-butanol:acetic acid:water (3:3:1), the main component of the substance (the substance which develops color with ninhydrin) was observed at an rf value of about 0.9.

AB  == dental implants provide a restorative tool to support crowns, bridge abutments, and removable dentures. osseointegrated implants are titanium posts that are surgically implanted in alveolar bone. a tight immobile bond (osseointegration) forms between bone and titanium, and prosthetic and restorative fixtures are attached to the implants. titanium implants differ from natural teeth, which may  make them more susceptible to mechanical stress. a small proportion of implants are not successful and may fail due to infection. the microbiota of implants is similar to that of teeth in similar clinical states. implants that fail because of mechanical stress are colonized by species associated with healthy teeth. infected implants are colonized by subgingival species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, and peptostreptococcus micros. different patients may be colonized by different microbial complexes, indicating that optimal treatment should be directed to the specific infection.

TI  == secretion of porphyromonas gingivalis fimbrillin polypeptides by recombinant streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == the fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. a structural subunit of the p. gingivalis fimbriae, fimbrillin, has been shown to promote adherence of the bacteria to host surfaces and also induce an immune response. biologically active domains of fimbrillin responsible for adherence or eliciting immune responses have been determined. in a previous study, we engineered the human oral commensal organism  streptococcus gordonii to express such biologically active domains on the surface of the bacteria as a vaccine delivery system. in this study we report an alternative approach of secreting fimbrillin polypeptide domains into the medium  by modification of the surface-expression system described earlier. such recombinant s. gordonii, in addition to being a source for antigen presentation to trigger a protective immune response, may have the added advantage of directly blocking the fimbriae-mediated adherence of p. gingivalis to the oral cavity following implantation. this approach can also be utilized for secreting other biologically important therapeutic molecules on mucosal surfaces for modulating local microenvironments.

TI  == identification of a streptococcus gordonii sspb domain that mediates adhesion to  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, a primary pathogen in adult periodontitis, may establish itself in the oral cavity by adhering to early plaque bacteria such as  streptococcus gordonii. our previous studies (r. j. lamont et al., microbiology 140:867-872, 1994) suggested that this interaction is mediated by the sspb polypeptide, a member of the antigen i/ii family of streptococcal surface proteins. s. gordonii was recently shown to express a second ssp polypeptide (sspa) that resembles sspb and the structurally homologous antigen i/ii polypeptide (pac) of streptococcus mutans. to determine if all of these related antigen i/ii proteins interacted with p. gingivalis, sspa, sspb, and pac were tested for adhesion to p. gingivalis cells. both of the s. gordonii ssp proteins  bound labeled target cells, whereas the s. mutans pac polypeptide did not, suggesting that antigen i/ii-mediated binding of p. gingivalis by streptococci may be species specific. to investigate the molecular basis for this functional difference, the p. gingivalis binding domain of sspb was mapped. the binding properties of a family of truncated sspb polypeptides lacking c-terminal sequences were determined. in addition, the lack of binding activity exhibited by the pac protein was exploited to construct and analyze chimeric sspb-pac polypeptides. both approaches revealed that the region defined by residues 1167 to 1250 of sspb was essential for p. gingivalis binding. this region of sspa and  sspb is entirely conserved, consistent with the binding properties determined for these proteins. however, the corresponding region of pac differs in both the primary sequence and predicted secondary structure, suggesting that the overall structure of this domain may define its functional activity.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == occurrence of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth: microbiological findings.
AB  == bacterial invasion in roots of periodontally diseased teeth, which has been recently documented using cultural and microscopic techniques, may be important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the occurrence and the species of invading bacteria in radicular dentin of periodontally diseased teeth. samples were taken from the middle layer  of radicular dentin of 26 periodontally diseased teeth. 14 healthy teeth were used as controls. dentin samples were cultured anaerobically. the chosen methodology allowed the determination of the numbers of bacteria present in both  deeper and outer part of dentinal tubules, and the bacterial concentration in dentin samples, expressed as colony forming units per mg of tissue (cfu/mg). invading bacteria was detected in 14 (53.8%) samples from periodontally diseased  teeth. the bacterial concentration ranged from 831.84 to 11971.3 cfu/mg (mean+/-standard deviation: 3043.15+/-2763.13). micro-organisms identified included putative periodontal pathogens such as prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros and streptococcus intermedius. these findings suggest that radicular dentin could act as bacterial reservoir from which periodontal pathogens can recolonize treated periodontal pockets, contributing to the failure of therapy and recurrence of disease.

AB  == the pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. a total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or streptococcus mitis. five strains of porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. the infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. none of the prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains in combination with a. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with s. mitis in 42-100%. no difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup i (p. intermedia) and serogroup ii and iii (p. nigrescens). the infectivity of p. intermedia or p. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. p. intermedia and p.  nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in  rabbits.

TI  == extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration  range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the  cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did  not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.

TI  == environmental regulation of fimbrial gene expression in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae are an important virulence factor involved in attachment and invasion. fimbrillin, encoded by the fima gene, is the major subunit protein of the fimbriae. to elucidate the influence of environmental signals on the expression of the fima gene, a strain of p. gingivalis (designated ple) containing a chromosomal transcriptional fusion between a promoterless lacz  gene and the fima promoter region was constructed. promoter activity was assessed by measurement of beta-galactosidase activity of ple. an 11-fold increase in activity of fima promoter was found as growth temperature declined from 39 to 34  degrees c. promoter activity decreased by approximately 50% in response to hemin  limitation and upon culture on solid medium. in addition, the presence of serum or saliva in the growth medium decreased fima promoter activity by similar amounts. a correlation between fima promoter activity and phenotypic properties dependent upon fimbriae was established. p. gingivalis grown at 34 degrees c, compared to 39 degrees c, showed an increased ability to adhere to streptococcus  gordonii and to invade primary cultures of gingival epithelial cells. these studies indicate that expression of the p. gingivalis fima gene is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to several environmental conditions and that altered fima expression can also modulate the adherence and invasion abilities of p. gingivalis.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == in vitro models that support adhesion specificity in biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == adhesion to adsorbed pellicles and interspecies co-adhesion to form plaque biofilms involve selective interactions of bacterial adhesins with specific receptors. our laboratory has devised in vitro assays for co-adhesion between actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis or porphyromonas gingivalis on saliva-coated mineral and hexadecane droplet substrata. p. gingivalis structures  significant for co-adhesion with a. naeslundii include surface vesicles and fimbriae. a family of arginine-specific cysteine proteinases in vesicles may be involved in adherence to bacteria, to host cells, and to matrix proteins. new research from several laboratories has found that such proteinases are processed  from genes encoding polyproteins containing both proteinase and hemagglutinin domains. in addition to enzyme-substrate recognition, bacterial adhesion is often determined by specific protein-peptide and lectincarbohydrate recognition. a. naeslundii--salivary prolinerich protein, s. gordonii--salivary alpha-amylase, and treponema denticola--matrix protein recognition are examples of the former. co-adhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis is an example of the latter. lactose can selectively desorb a. naeslundii cells from mixed biofilms with s. oralis, a  demonstration of the significance of specificity. although non-specific forces are probably secondary to stereochemical fit in determining the selective range of surfaces that bacteria have evolved to recognize and bind, they probably help  stabilize non-covalent bonds within aligned, complementary domains.

TI  == prophyromonas gingivalis fimbriae mediate coaggregation with streptococcus oralis through specific domains.
AB  == fimbriae are major adhesive components on the cell surface of prophyromonas gingivalis. in this study, we evaluated the role of fimbriae in coaggregation with streptococcus oralis. fimbriae purified from p. gingivalis competitively inhibited the coaggregation by 100% at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. on the other hand, the same amount of lipopolysaccharide isolated from p. gingivalis was inhibited by only 25% of the level of the fimbriae. a fima-inactivated mutant of p. gingivalis failed to show distinct coaggregation activity. fimbriae added to a solution of various strains of streptococci caused their self-aggregation at a concentration of 10 to 30 micrograms/ml. the self-aggregation induced by fimbriae was inhibited by lambda-arginine (20 to 40 mm/l). iodinated fimbriae reacted with s. oralis cells immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane, and 100  degrees c heating of the cells diminished the binding abilities. recombinant fimbrillin (r-fim, corresponding to whole residues 1 to 337 of native fimbrillin) of p. gingivalis also showed 100% inhibition of the coaggregation. the r-fim variant (residues 1 to 286) lacking the c-terminal 51 residues was as inhibitory  as r-fim. however, the variant (residues 1 to 265) without the c-terminal 72 residues lost 77% of the inhibitory activity. these findings suggested that residues 266 to 286 contain a domain involved in the coaggregation of p. gingivalis with s. oralis. inhibition by three polypeptides corresponding to residues 266 to 286, 266 to 337, and 287 to 337 was studied. peptides 266 to 286  and 266 to 337 inhibited by 96 and 100%, respectively, at a concentration of 1.5  nmol/ml. peptide 287 to 337 also showed a significant inhibitory effect but to a  slightly lesser extent than that of peptide 266 to 286. p. gingivalis fimbriae appear to be involved in coaggregation with streptococci, probably through an adhesive protein molecule(s) of the latter, and the fimbriae possess several domains in the c-terminal residues 266 to 337 for interaction with s. oralis.

TI  == expression of functional porphyromonas gingivalis fimbrillin polypeptide domains  on the surface of streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == genetically engineering bacteria to express surface proteins which can antagonize the colonization of other microorganisms is a promising strategy for altering bacterial environments. the fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis play an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. a structural subunit  of the p. gingivalis fimbriae, fimbrillin, has been shown to be an important virulence factor, which likely promotes adherence of the bacterium to saliva-coated oral surfaces and induces host responses. immunization of gnotobiotic rats with synthetic peptides based on the predicted amino acid sequence of fimbrillin has also been shown to elicit a specific immune response and protection against p. gingivalis-associated periodontal destruction. in this  study we engineered the human oral commensal organism streptococcus gordonii to surface express subdomains of the fimbrillin polypeptide fused to the anchor region of streptococcal m6 protein. the resulting recombinant s. gordonii strains expressing p. gingivalis fimbrillin bound saliva-coated hydroxyapatite in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited binding of p. gingivalis to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. moreover, the recombinant s. gordonii strains were  capable of eliciting a p. gingivalis fimbrillin-specific immune response in rabbits. these results show that functional and immunologically reactive p. gingivalis fimbrillin polypeptides can be expressed on the surface of s. gordonii. the recombinant fimbrillin-expressing s. gordonii strains may provide an effective vaccine or a vehicle for replacement therapy against p. gingivalis.  these experiments demonstrated the feasibility of expressing biologically active  agents (antigens or adhesin molecules) by genetically engineered streptococci. such genetically engineered organisms can be utilized to modulate the microenvironment of the oral cavity.

TI  == monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin-8 production in mononuclear cells stimulated by oral microorganisms.
AB  == chemokines are a family of low-molecular-weight proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate recruitment of leukocytes. the chemokines interleukin-8 (il-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. chemokine expression contributes to the presence of different leukocyte populations observed in normal and pathologic states. in the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were stimulated by microbes (candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) selected based upon their importance as oral pathogens. il-8 and mcp-1 gene expression and protein release were determined by northern blot (rna blot) analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. c. albicans, p. gingivalis, and a. actinomycetemcomitans induced high levels of production of both mcp-1 and il-8. s. mutans was a strong inducer of mcp-1, but it did not stimulate significant production of il-8. c. albicans, s. mutans, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 500 to 5,000 times more potent than p. gingivalis in terms of mcp-1 production. in general, the microbe-to-pbmc ratios required for maximum gene expression of mcp-1 were lower than those for il-8. however, for actual protein release of mcp-1 versus il-8, differences in the effects of various microbe concentrations were observed only for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results demonstrate that different oral pathogens induce specific dose-dependent patterns of chemokine gene expression and release. such patterns may help explain the immunopathology of oral infections, particularly with regard to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.

TI  == the relation of microbiologic data to aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity  in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and is itself a location for specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. aspartate aminotransferase (ast) is one of the components of gcf that is released as a result of cell death. in this study, 40 periodontal  sites in 10 early onset periodontitis patients before and after nonsurgical periodontal therapy, with and without local metronidazole administration, were first examined for the ast enzyme levels in gcf and then evaluated for microbiological and clinical variables. in each patient, 4 sites (one site/quadrant) with a probing depth of > or = 5 mm were selected and treated with separate treatment protocols. certain microbial species including prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans(a. a.) were found more often and/or in higher levels in ast active sites (36/40 first measurement--9/36 second measurement), while other species (streptococcus and actinomyces) were found more often and/or in higher levels in ast inactive sites (4/40 first measurement--8/36 second measurement). eight post-treatment ast active sites revealed 1.5 mm of attachment loss, whereas 8 post-treatment ast inactive sites showed 1.37 mm of attachment gain. ast activity and microbiological-clinical data presenting such an agreement suggests that, ast level assessment would be beneficial as an adjunctive method alongside other clinical criteria, in guiding the clinician in periodontal treatment.

TI  == phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of porphyromonas and prevotella species.
AB  == species of prevotella (pr.) and porphyromonas (po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 j cm(-2)). fluences of 35 to 80 j cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in po. endodontalis, po. gingivalis, pr. denticola, pr. intermedia, pr. melaninogenica and pr. nigrescens. a fluence of 70 j cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of bacillus, candida, enterobacter, proteus, pseudomonas, staphylococcus  and streptococcus. the phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against prevotella and porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin  content of the cells. overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of  argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of prevotella or porphyromonas.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than  that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.

TI  == antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola.  when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease  sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == the effect of oral commensal bacteria on candidal adhesion to denture acrylic surfaces. an in vitro study.
AB  == the effect of four different species of oral bacteria (streptococci (x 2); escherichia; porphyromonas) on the adhesion of candida albicans and candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees c, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for e. coli-c. albicans and s. salivarius-c. albicans combinations. candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to s. sanguis and p. gingivalis, but not e. coli. there were also significant differences in relative adhesion between c. albicans and c. krusei. taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.

TI  == response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and b. forsythus.
AB  == in a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in  each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for  their content of 14 subgingival species including p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia and b. forsythus using dna probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species  group. because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. however, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed  minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. low test species subjects receiving augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. the mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. high test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving augmentin (14.1). periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with  augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. the greatest proportion of  gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in c. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. in contrast, augmentin appeared to be effective  in decreasing the % sites colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by c. ochracea. knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for  periodontal therapy.

TI  == experimental model for porphyromonas gingivalis infection in animals.
AB  == a virulence model suitable for studying the dynamics of porphyromonas gingivalis  infection, including the pathogenicity of p. gingivalis in experimentally induced infections of multiple organs was developed using mouse and hamster. virulence of p. gingivalis strains was expressed contrastingly in subcutaneous (sc) infection  in the murine abscess model (mam) and the hamsters abscess model (ham). subcutaneous infection in the mam was characterized by a gravity abscess, spreading from the primary site of inoculation downwards, frequently erupting as  a secondary lesion. in contract, s.c. p. gingivalis infection in ham was characterized as a palpable localized abscess at the primary site of inoculation. when the semi-solid agar (ssa) was added to the mono-culture of p. gingivalis, reproducibility of infection in both models was enhanced. p. gingivalis culture supplemented with haemin, or combined with oral actinomyces viscosus had its virulence overtly enhanced and often fatal in the mam. menadione, eh reducing agents and mixture with the streptococcus or a. neaslundii did not potentiate virulence in either mode. transtracheal challenge of the lungs of hamster with p. gingivalis initiated an early pneumonitis and later sequelae of necrosis and abscess formation. also, abscess was induced by direct inoculation of p. gingivalis in the muscles, liver and testes, but did not induce intra-abdominal abscesses. in conclusion, the ham applied with the ssa procedure caused a localized p. gingivalis tissue infection with practical advantages for quantitative and qualitative studies of p. gingivalis infections. this study also demonstrates the pathogenic potential of p. gingivalis by reproducing similar infections in multiple anatomical sites.

TI  == refractory periodontitis or recurrence of disease.
AB  == refractory periodontal disease is characterized by low plaque scores and low responsiveness to periodontal therapy. the patients often have a history of antibiotic therapy and therefore have a high incidence of resistance in the subgingival microflora. the above features are in contrast to adult chronic periodontal disease and recurrence of disease. the subgingival microflora of refractory disease may be either predominantly gram-positive with elevated levels of streptococcus intermedius or may be gram negative and contain elevated levels  of the classical periodontal pathogens. in some cases serum igg antibodies against porphyromonas gingivalis are elevated and seem to decrease after therapy. smoking may be an important factor in refractory periodontal disease. treatment with directed antibiotic therapy as an adjunct to scaling and root planing retards the progression of disease for a limited time. many questions are still not answered and suggestions are made for future directions in research.

TI  == rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.

AB  == strong interspecies adherence was demonstrated among the periodontal pathogens treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus and porphyromonas gingivalis, and between these pathogens and the commensal plaque organism streptococcus crista. adherence showed specificity and demonstrated saturation binding kinetics. binding between b. forsythus and p. gingivalis appeared to be a unimodal protein-protein interaction. binding between the other organisms was at least bimodal involving interactions between combinations of proteins and carbohydrates with a variety of sugar specificities. salivary molecules prevented adherence between t. denticola and s. crista, and serum eliminated b. forsythus binding to  p. gingivalis. all other interactions occurred to some degree in the presence of  serum and saliva. such interbacterial binding interactions may be important in the establishment of periodontopathic plaque.

TI  == a microbiological and clinical study of the safety and efficacy of baking-soda dentifrices.
AB  == this article reports the results of a study that examined the clinical and microbiological changes associated with regular use of baking-soda dentifrices. two dentifrice formulations were examined in a 6-month longitudinal study of 101  adult subjects with assessments for plaque, gingival inflammation, and stain at baseline and 3 and 6 months during the active phase of the study, and at 3 months after cessation of product use. one dentifrice contained 52% baking soda and 3% sodium percarbonate (arm & hammer peroxicare) while the other dentifrice contained 65% baking soda (arm & hammer dental care). both dentifrices resulted in statistically significant reductions in dental plaque, gingival inflammation,  and stain at all time periods compared to baseline. dental plaque and buccal soft-tissue samples were obtained for microbiological analysis from a 50-subject  subset. microbiological assays, including bacterial culture, phase-contrast microscopy, and immunofluorescence microscopy, confirmed the safety of both formulations. beneficial alterations in dental plaque bacteria were noted, including significant reductions in the levels of actinomyces species. the data from this study indicate that dentifrices containing high levels of baking soda are clinically effective and microbiologically safe.

TI  == inverse correlation between the proportion of salivary bacteria inhibiting streptococcus mutans and the percentage of untreated carious teeth.
AB  == to evaluate the role of inhibitory substances produced by bacteria in the oral cavity, we estimated, by a deferred test on todd-hewitt agar enriched with hemin  and vitamin k, the proportion of bacteria that inhibited or stimulated the growth of streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis, from the saliva of 109 patients (54 males and 55 females) attending our dental clinics. the patients, aged from 8 to 75 years old (mean: 31 +/- 18 years), were randomly selected whatever the reason for their visit. the results, evaluated with the spearman rank test, indicated that there was no statistically significant (p > 0.05) correlation between the proportion of salivary bacteria inhibiting or stimulating p. gingivalis with the community periodontal index of treatment needs (cpitn), the number of carious, missing and filled teeth, or with the decayed, missing and filled teeth index (dmft). also, no statistically significant correlation was observed between the proportion of salivary bacteria stimulating the growth of s. mutans and the above mentioned health indexes. however, a statistically significant (p < 0.005) negative correlation was found between the percentage of  cultivated bacteria that inhibit s. mutans and the percentage of untreated carious teeth as well as with the cpitn. the results thus indicate a possible role for inhibitory substances produced by bacteria in the maintenance of oral health.

TI  == endodontic pathogens: propagation of infection through patent dentinal tubules in traumatized monkey teeth.
AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in marginal periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be an aggravating factor in progression of marginal destruction. this has been associated with patency of  dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the purpose of the present investigation was to study to what extent a predefined selection of endodontic pathogens inoculated in the root canal can influence periodontal pathology and healing in areas of the root covered by or devoid of cementum, using root resorption as a histomorphometric marker. exposed dentine surfaces, in the present study showed significantly larger areas of resorption in infected roots compared to non-infected roots, while cementum surfaces showed an almost identical distribution of tissue reactions regardless of root canal infection or  not. it was concluded that endodontic pathogens or their products were not able to penetrate the cementum barrier. the significantly larger areas of resorption on exposed dentine surfaces in infected roots compared to non-infected roots indicated that endodontic pathogens or their products could spread through dentinal tubules to a root surface void of cementum. extrapolated to the marginal situation this indicated that endodontic pathogens in the root canal might be able to aggravate marginal infection in areas of root devoid of cementum.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis outer membrane vesicles promote bacterial resistance to  chlorhexidine.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been frequently associated with some types of periodontal diseases and possesses various mechanisms favoring the pathogenic process. it has been recently observed that vesicles elaborated by p. gingivalis  are able to protect bacteria from the bactericidal activity of human serum. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the ability of vesicles from p.  gingivalis in protecting oral bacteria against chlorhexidine. data indicate that  vesicles released by p. gingivalis may bind chlorhexidine, thus allowing protection for itself and for other oral bacterial species. it has also been demonstrated that lipopolysaccharides are the major component involved in the binding of chlorhexidine by vesicles. the mechanism of resistance reported in this study indicates that bacterial interactions in the oral cavity may influence the sensitivity of microbes.

AB  == by using an in vitro bone-forming culture system, the chick periosteal osteogenesis (cpo) model, the direct effects on osteogenesis of sonicated extracts derived from oral bacteria were examined. both extracts from bacterial species having strong associations with periodontal diseases (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia, hereinafter referred to as suspected periodontopathogens) and extracts from species not correlated with periodontal disease (streptococcus sanguis, veillonella atypica, and prevotella denticola, hereinafter referred to as nonpathogenic bacteria) were tested. all bacterial cultures were grown under standard anaerobic culture conditions. sonicated bacterial extracts were prepared from the bacterial pellet. these were added in various proportions to the cpo cultures. parameters of osteogenesis, including alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium and p(i) accumulation, and collagen synthesis, were measured in 6-day-old cultures. compared with controls grown in the absence of bacterial products, osteogenesis was inhibited significantly in cultures treated with extracts derived from the suspected periodontopathogens. no osteogenic inhibition was observed in cultures treated with extracts from the nonpathogenic bacteria. these results suggest that the ability to inhibit osteogenesis in vitro may be a pathogenic property shared by a limited group of species. further characterization of the p. gingivalis extracts revealed that both proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous products, including lipopolysaccharide, were able to inhibit osteogenesis. p. gingivalis extract-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis in cpo cultures was blocked by indomethacin, implicating prostaglandins in the regulation of the bacterial effects. the bacterial extracts had either reversible or irreversible inhibitory effects on osteogenesis when added after differentiation or before/during differentiation of bone cells, respectively.

AB  == several effects of thymol, a plant-derived antimicrobial agent, on porphyromonas  gingivalis, selenomonas artemidis and streptococcus sobrinus were examined. the extremely rapid efflux of intracellular constituents evoked by thymol is consistent with its postulated membranotropic effects. correlations between leakage-inducing concentrations of thymol and minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations suggest that membrane perforation is a principal mode of action of this substance. the thymol-induced decline in intracellular atp in s. sobrinus appears to be entirely attributable to leakage,  whereas in p. gingivalis thymol may also inhibit atp-generating pathways. relative changes in the transmembrane potential of resting cells of s. sobrinus pulsed with glucose are as sensitive to thymol as is leakage from this organism.  the effects of thymol on transmembrane potential are probably secondary to those  arising from leakage of intracellular substances.

AB  == periapical pathology indicating endodontic infection, when present in periodontitis-affected teeth, has recently been shown to be correlated to marginal periodontal breakdown. this has been associated with patency of dentinal tubules in the tooth cervix, an area normally devoid of cementum following periodontal therapy. these studies are, however hampered by that only circumstantial evidence such as presence of periapical destruction have been applied as criteria of endodontic infection. the aim of the present investigation was to assess the effects of endodontic pathogens on marginal periodontal wound healing on root surfaces devoid of cementum but surrounded by healthy periodontal membrane. significant differences between infected and non-infected teeth were found with respect to pathological pocket and connective tissue: the experimental defects were covered by approximately 20% more pocket epithelium in infected teeth while defects in non-infected teeth showed approximately 10% more connective tissue coverage. it was concluded, that an intra-canal infection of endodontic pathogens stimulates epithelial downgrowth along denuded dentin surfaces with marginal communication. extrapolated to the clinical situation, endodontic infections in periodontitis-prone patients may augment periodontitis propagation.

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  == periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (jp), rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), and adult periodontitis (ap), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. these disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. the present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of pbmc of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. the ap group had a significantly lower production of il-1ra when stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) (p < 0.05). streptococcus sanguis (s.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of il-1 alpha and tnf alpha production in all groups. the rpp group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (mc) than the ap group (p < 0.05). additionally, jp patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (p < 0.05). in conclusion, il-1 alpha, tnf alpha, or il-6 production by peripheral blood mc after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. the results support the hypothesis that the cytokine il-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: rpp and ap. furthermore, elevated mc concentration in the rpp group compared to the ap group may be an important pathogenic feature in rpp.

TI  == oral bacterial attachment to titanium surfaces: a scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  == despite the wide use of dental implants, the understanding of the mechanism(s) of bacterial attachment to implant surfaces and of the factors that affect such attachment is limited. in this study, the attachment of oral bacteria--including  streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis--to titanium (ti) discs with different surface morphology (smooth, grooved, or rough) was examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the most bacterial attachment was observed on the rough bsa-coated ti surfaces. the smooth surfaces promoted poor attachment for s. sanguis and a. viscosus. however, p. gingivalis attached equally well to both the smooth and grooved coated ti surfaces, based on direct cell quantitation and examination with sem. cell-surface fimbriae (which may play a role in adhesion) of both a. viscosus and p. gingivalis observed were associated with the ti surfaces. ti implant surface characteristics appeared to influence oral bacterial attachment in vitro. the in vitro attachment system has  proven its usefulness for future bacterial attachment studies with model implant  surfaces.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 vesicle on adherence of streptococcus mutans omz 70 to the experimental pellicle.
AB  == the vesicles of porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 strongly aggregated streptococcus cricetus, s. rattus, and s. mutans, but poorly aggregated s. sobrinus. the adherence of s. mutans omz 70 to hydroxyapatite (ha) coated with whole saliva was increased in parallel with the quantity of the vesicles. the significant increase of adherence of s. mutans omz 70 by the vesicles was also observed on the ha coated with parotid saliva, submandibular saliva, serum, and type i collagen. these findings suggest that the vesicles may act as a bridge between mutans streptococcus and the tooth surface.

TI  == revised sequence of the porphyromonas gingivalis prtt cysteine protease/hemagglutinin gene: homology with streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b/streptococcal proteinase.
AB  == the prtt gene from porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 53977 was previously isolated from an escherichia coli clone possessing trypsinlike protease activity upstream  of a region encoding hemagglutinin activity (j. otogoto and h. kuramitsu, infect. immun. 61;117-123, 1993). subsequent molecular analysis of this gene has revealed that the prtt protein is larger than originally reported, encompassing the hemagglutination region. results of primer extension experiments indicate that the translation start site was originally misidentified. an alternate open reading frame of nearly 2.7 kb, which encodes a protein in the size range of 96 to 99 kda, was identified. in vitro transcription-translation experiments confirm this size, and northern (rna) blot experiments indicate that the protease is translated from a 3.3-kb mrna. searching the embl protein database revealed that  the amino acid sequence of the revised prtt is similar to sequences of two related proteins from streptococcus pyogenes. prtt is 31% identical and 73% similar over 401 amino acids to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b. in addition,  it is 36% identical and 74% similar over 244 amino acids with streptococcal proteinase, which is closely related to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b. the similarity is particularly high at the putative active site of streptococcal proteinase, which is similar to the active sites of the family of cysteine proteases. thus, we conclude that prtt is a 96- to 99-kda cysteine protease and hemagglutinin with significant similarity to streptococcal enzymes.

TI  == periodontal disease in adult insulin-dependent diabetics.
AB  == the overall objective with the present investigations was to study the influence  of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) on periodontal conditions and to identify factors that may be predictors for severe periodontal disease in individuals with iddm. periodontal conditions were studied in two cross-sectional studies of adult, insulin-dependent diabetics and age-and sex-matched controls. in one study 72 diabetics with short-(sd) and 82 with long-duration (ld) diabetes and 77 controls participated. in the other study 83 ld diabetics and 99 controls  took part. the portion of individuals exhibiting severe periodontal disease was larger in the diabetic group than in the control group. advanced periodontal disease appeared in earlier ages (40-49 years) in the ld diabetics compared to the sd diabetics and controls. in fact, the 40-49-year-old ld diabetics had alveolar bone loss equal to the older controls (60-69 years). ld diabetics exhibited more severe periodontitis than sd diabetics. some salivary factors were studied in 72 sd and 82 ld diabetics and 77 controls. ld and sd diabetics had a lower stimulated salivary secretion rate and an increased glucose content compared to the controls. the reduction in flow rate, however, was moderate, and  all mean values were within the normal limits. the moderately increased glucose content did not result in higher mean numbers of candida albicans, lactobacilli,  and mutans streptococci. the subgingival bacterial species currently considered to be associated with periodontitis were studied in 30 ld diabetics and 34 controls. all these bacterial species were recovered in diabetics as well as controls. more ld diabetics than controls harboured porphyromonas gingivalis. in  the control group the periopathogens were recovered more often in deep periodontal pockets. in the ld group, however, these bacterial species were recovered as often in shallow as in deep periodontal pockets. the medical status  of 39 matched pairs of ld diabetics was analysed. one in each pair had severe periodontal disease while the other had no/minor symptoms of periodontal disease. biochemical analyses and clinical variables routinely used in monitoring diabetics failed to discriminate between diabetics with severe and minor periodontal disease. diabetics with severe periodontal disease, however, showed a higher prevalence of renal disease and cardiovascular complications such as stroke, transient ischemic attacks, angina, myocardial infarct, heart failure, and claudicatio intermittens than diabetics with only minor periodontal disease.  this indicates that closer cooperation between the diabetologist and the dentist  is necessary in monitoring the diabetic patient.

TI  == characterization of coaggregation and fibrinogen-binding by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == we have examined whether the adhesin of porphyromonas gingivalis which aggregates streptococcus oralis contributes to its fibrinogen-binding. various properties of coaggregation between p. gingivalis and s. oralis were compared with those of fibrinogen-binding to p. gingivalis cells. the coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric method and the fibrinogen-binding activity was determined by using 125i-fibrinogen. both the activities showed maximum values in the ph range from 5.0 to 6.0 and they were inhibited by arginine and lysine. heating treatment of p. gingivalis 381 cells at 75 degrees c abrogated the activities. however, treatment of p. gingivalis 381 cells with proteinase k considerably reduced the fibrinogen-binding activity but not the coaggregation activity. metal ions such as zn2+ and cu2+ inhibited the coaggregation activity but enhanced the fibrinogen-binding activity. the results also indicated that p.  gingivalis strains 381, atcc 33277 and su-3 showed relatively higher activities both in coaggregation and fibrinogen-binding, whereas p. gingivalis strains w83,  51 and 165 showing lower fibrinogen-binding activity than p. gingivalis 381 did not coaggregate with s. oralis atcc 9811. these findings suggest that coadhesin of p. gingivalis with s. oralis is not be associated with its fibrinogen-binding.

TI  == effect of binding of fibrinogen to each bacterium on coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis.
AB  == fibrinogen inhibits the coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis. in this study, we determined which bacterium interacts with fibrinogen in this inhibitory process. although preincubation of each bacterium with fibrinogen did not inhibit coaggregation, its activity was completely eliminated by the addition of protease inhibitors such as n-ethylmaleimide (nem), p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate and n alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone  to the preincubation mixture with fibrinogen and p. gingivalis. however, the inhibition of coaggregation was not found after preincubation of s. oralis with fibrinogen in the presence or absence of the protease inhibitors. labelled materials were recovered from the extract of p. gingivalis cells incubated with radioiodinated fibrinogen in the presence of nem but not in the absence of nem. in the binding experiment, p. gingivalis showed a much higher binding activity to fibrinogen than s. oralis. these findings suggest that fibrinogen and its fragment(s) may mask directly or indirectly the aggregation site with s. oralis on the p. gingivalis cells in its inhibitory process of coaggregation.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of necrotizing ulcerative gingivo-periodontitis (anup) diagnosed in two brothers, age 9 (anup1)  and 14 (anup2) from rural egypt. complete blood count, differential and blood chemistry were within normal limits for both brothers and they were not malnourished. the phagocytosis and killing function of their polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) towards four bacterial species were assessed using a fluorochrome microassay. the selection of bacterial species was based on preliminary microbiological results in early onset periodontitis in egypt. fluorochrome-labeled prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were pre-opsonized with anup serum and added to pmn from both anup patients, as well as pmn from three sex-matched and two sex- and age-matched healthy egyptian control (ctl) subjects. we found significant depressions (p < 0.05) in pmn phagocytosis and killing of c. rectus and p. intermedia by anup1 and anup2, when compared to all ctl pmn. an assessment of the gram-negative subgingival microflora present in both anup patients (in colony forming unit percent of total cfu recovered) (cfu %) revealed the presence of p. intermedia (anup1, 41.7 cfu %; anup2, 14.8 cfu %), fusobacterium nucleatum (anup1, 3.6 cfu %; anup2, 48.1 cfu %), and veillonella spp. (anup1, 18.2 cfu %; anup2, 18.5 cfu %). spirochetes were also observed in cytocentrifuged, gram-stained plaque from both anup patients. the predominant gram-positive bacterial species recovered from both nug1 and nug2 was streptococcus morbillorum.

TI  == molecules of streptococcus gordonii that bind to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == interbacterial binding is considered an important colonization mechanism for many of the organisms that inhabit dental plaque. porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can adhere to species that comprise early plaque, such as streptococcus gordonii. in this study, the molecules of s. gordonii g9b that mediate binding to p. gingivalis were investigated. biotinylated surface molecules of s. gordonii were extracted and mixed with p. gingivalis cells. interactive streptococcal components were identified by sds-page of the p. gingivalis cells followed by electroblotting, and visualization of the adsorbed streptococcal molecules with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. s. gordonii molecules of 45 kda and a doublet of 62/60 kda were observed to bind to p. gingivalis. polyclonal antibodies raised to the 62/60 kda proteins inhibited the  binding interaction. these antibodies demonstrated an antigenic relationship between the 62/60 kda molecules and the 45 kda protein. both molecules were also  antigenically related to, and may be breakdown products of, a larger molecule of  170 kda which is antigenically related to the p1 antigen of s. mutans. cloning and expression in enterococcus faecalis of the gene for the p1-like molecule from s. gordonii m5 resulted in a phenotype that expressed the 62/60 kda and 45 kda antigens and was capable of binding to p. gingivalis. these results suggest that  a p1-like molecule in s. gordonii is involved in adherence to p. gingivalis. processing of the p1-like molecule into smaller fragments of 62/60 kda and 45 kda may be required for binding activity.

AB  == large numbers of porphyromonas, prevotella, and bacteroides strains were screened by 3 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) and 8 rabbit antisera raised against porphyromonas gingivalis, in order to detect any possible recognition of non-p. gingivalis surface antigens by these immunoreagents. all three mabs, which were lps-specific, extensively recognized lps from 10 p. gingivalis strains in immunoblotting, whereas they recognized none of the 34 non-p. gingivalis strains. rabbit antisera were similarly specific for p. gingivalis cells in immunofluorescence and with lps in grid-blotting, but several of them recognized  lps from one prevotella melaninogenica and 5 prevotella intermedia strains in western blotting. since several pre-immune sera and an irrelevant serum raised to a streptococcus species recognized up to 5 of these preparations, we exclude that the reactions were due to antigens shared by p. gingivalis and prevotella. rather, we consider that they were false-positive reactions due to natural antibodies, stimulated in a non-specific manner upon immunization with p. gingivalis, in animals whose immune systems were sensitized to prevotella species before immunization.

TI  == inactivation of the porphyromonas gingivalis fima gene blocks periodontal damage  in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == fimbrial production by porphyromonas gingivalis was inactivated by insertion-duplication mutagenesis, using the cloned gene for the p. gingivalis major fimbrial subunit protein, fima. by several criteria, this insertion mutation rendered p. gingivalis unable to produce fimbrilin or an intact fimbrial structure. a nonfimbriated mutant, dpg3, hemagglutinated sheep erythrocytes normally and was unimpaired in the ability to coaggregate with streptococcus gordonii g9b. the cell surface hydrophobicity of dpg3 was also unaffected by the  loss of fimbriae. however, dpg3 was significantly less able to bind to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite than wild-type p. gingivalis 381. this suggested that p. gingivalis fimbriae are important for adherence of the organism to saliva-coated oral surfaces. further, dpg3 was significantly less able to cause periodontal bone loss in a gnotobiotic rat model of periodontal disease. these observations are consistent with other data suggesting that p. gingivalis fimbriae play an important role in the pathogenesis of human periodontal disease.

AB  == alkaline phosphatase (alpase) activity was quantitatively compared in various kinds of oral bacteria. high alpase activity was detected in 3 species of periodontal bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga sputigena. the alpase activity detected in these bacteria was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). by contrast, the activity of mammalian alpase isoenzymes was not inhibited at all even in the presence of 1% sds. these results indicate that the alpase assay in combination with 1% sds can identify the origin of alpase detected in gingival crevicular fluid as being from bacteria or from a host response. clinical examination with adult periodontitis revealed that alpase activity in gingival crevicular fluid from the patients consisted of a combination of sds-sensitive and sds-resistant activities. these findings indicate that alpase activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid originates not only from bacteria but also  from a host response.

TI  == short-term microbiological and clinical effects of subgingival irrigation with an antimicrobial mouthrinse.
AB  == fifty chronic adult periodontitis patients completed a 6-week controlled, double-blind, split mouth clinical study to determine the effects of subgingival  irrigation with an antimicrobial mouthrinse on periodontal microflora, supragingival plaque, and gingivitis when used as an adjunct to normal oral hygiene. qualifying subjects had at least four sites, two on each side of the mouth, with probing depths between 4 and 6 mm, which bled on gentle probing. following baseline examinations, subjects received a half mouth scaling and prophylaxis and full mouth subgingival irrigation with either the antimicrobial mouthrinse or sterile colored water control professionally delivered. subjects continued irrigation at home once daily for 42 days with their assigned rinse delivered via a subgingival delivery system. all sites in the mouth were scored at baseline and at day 42 for supragingival plaque, bleeding on probing, and redness. for the four selected periodontitis sites, probing depth and attachment  level were measured at baseline and on day 42; additionally, supragingival plaque and gingival redness were scored on days 7 and 21. subgingival plaque samples for microbiological analysis were harvested from the selected periodontal sites at baseline and on days 7, 21, and 42. microbiologically, irrigation with the antimicrobial mouthrinse resulted in statistically significant reductions compared to control in putative periodontopathogens, including black pigmenting species, which persisted at 42 days. clinically, subgingival irrigation with the  antimicrobial mouthrinse produced a significant reduction in supragingival plaque (p < 0.001), bleeding on probing (p = 0.019), and redness (p = 0.017) compared to the control, whether or not the area irrigated received a prophylaxis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci.
AB  == coaggregation occurred between porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci.  the coaggregation was completely inhibited by l-arginine, n alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), and a trypsin inhibitor, and weakly inhibited by l-lysine, n-ethylmaleimide, lysozyme, and human whole saliva. the results of heat and proteinase k treatment suggested that a heat-labile proteinaceous substance of p. gingivalis and a heat-stable substance of mutans streptococci may play a role in the coaggregation. mutans streptococci also aggregated in the presence of the heat-labile factor in the supernatant of p. gingivalis. the aggregation was also inhibited by l-arginine, tlck, and a trypsin inhibitor.

TI  == a comparison of two transport media for saliva and subgingival samples.
AB  == this study has shown that microorganisms associated with caries (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) and marginal periodontitis (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in pure culture can be stored in vmga or reduced transport fluid and be recovered sufficiently after 24 h. sufficient recovery after 24 h of mail transport was also obtained in 37 saliva samples obtained from adults and 80 subgingival samples from a group of patients before and 3, 6 and 15 months after periodontal treatment. the samples transported in vmga iii showed in comparison to the samples transported in reduced transport fluid a higher recovery rate as well as a higher percentage of  the total viable count for investigated anaerobic species. this was explained by  the different composition of the two media and also by the gel consistency of vmga iii, which maintains a low redox-potential even during transport after transferring a sample into the medium. in a few samples aerobic bacteria increased in both media.

TI  == transmission of oral bacterial species between spouses.
AB  == the transmission of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci was studied between 4 married couples who suffered from advanced periodontitis. of the 20 couples investigated, the 4 in which both spouses harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were chosen for the transmission study. three of these couples also harbored mutans streptococci. a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (8-24 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (5-23 per subject) were serotyped by immunodiffusion technique. for ribotyping, chromosomal dna from a. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (4-5 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (4-11 per subject) was digested with restriction endonucleases clai or bgli and hindiii or smai, respectively. p. gingivalis isolates (2-15 per subject) were ribotyped by using clai, bgli and smai. the blotted restriction fragments were hybridized to the plasmid pkk3535, which contains the rrna operon of the e. coli chromosome. the spouses in 2 couples shared the same sero- and ribotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans. p. gingivalis ribotypes were identical in 2  couples. the result suggests transmission of oral bacteria between spouses.

TI  == bacteriology of dental infections.
AB  == the most common dental diseases, periodontal disease and dental caries, are chronic infections caused by bacteria of normal oral flora. when these bacteria increase in number and irritation exceeds the host defence threshold, disease arises. the human oral flora comprises more than 300 different bacteria. during the last decade approximately 10 species, mainly gram-negative anaerobes, have been noted as putative pathogens in periodontal disease. the gram-positive and facultatively anaerobic mutans streptococci are aetiologically the most important bacteria in dental caries. data have rapidly increased on the association of these bacteria with certain periodontal diseases or caries, on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, pathogenic mechanisms, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and transmission among family members. chronic dental infections have been the focus of renewed interest because of recent advances in oral microbiology as well as in medicine. we now know that in addition to oral streptococci, recently classified, fastidious periodontal anaerobes can be detected from various extra-oral infections. oral bacteria may spread into the blood stream through ulcerated epithelium in diseased periodontal pockets and cause transient bacteraemias, which are regarded as increased risk, especially for immunocompromised patients or persons with endoprotheses. in these patients,  routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for invasive dental care procedures. also the new association between dental infections and myocardial/cerebral infarction have offered new challenges for cooperation between dental and medical researchers.

TI  == inhibition of coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis by fibrinogen fragments.
AB  == the localization of regions of fibrinogen that inhibit coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis was investigated. the coaggregation was inhibited by a alpha and gamma chains, but not by b beta chain. the inhibitory activity of fragment d was more potent than that of fragment e. some cyanogen bromide-treated fragments isolated from a alpha and gamma chains including the nh2-terminal 148-207 amino acid residues of a alpha chain (a alpha  148-207) and gamma 1-78 showed inhibitory activities. a alpha 148-207 was further digested with lysyl endopeptidase. a alpha 158-176 and a alpha 192-206 which contained four and two arginine residues, respectively, retained the inhibitory activities. when the arginine residues of these two peptides were modified by phenylglyoxal, the inhibitory activities were much reduced. these findings suggest that the arginine residues of some specific regions of fibrinogen may play an important role in the inhibition of the coaggregation.

TI  == involvement of porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae in adherence to streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to early plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus gordonii, is considered an important colonization mechanism. the molecules that mediate this interspecies binding have not been determined. fimbriae were prepared from p. gingivalis 33277 by mild agitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation and deae-sepharose chromatography. in a nitrocellulose blot adherence assay, purified fimbriae inhibited s. gordonii g9b-p. gingivalis 33277  binding by up to 54%. in addition, fimbriae bound to s. gordonii cells in a dot-blot assay. incubation of fimbriae with s. gordonii cells followed by washing, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), electroblotting and probing with p. gingivalis antibodies also revealed that the  fimbriae bind to s. gordonii. in contrast, s. gordonii did not interact with fimbriae that were first subjected to sds-page and electroblotting or deposited on a nitrocellulose membrane, suggesting that conformational determinants of the  fimbriae may be important in binding. the results indicate that binding between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii is mediated, at least in part, by the porphyromonads' fimbriae.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == levels of salivary iga antibodies reactive with bacteria from dental plaque are associated with susceptibility to experimental gingivitis.
AB  == serum igg, iga and igm and salivary iga antibody levels reactive with extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eubacterium  saburreum and streptococcus mutans, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay in samples from 12 persons before, during and after experimental gingivitis. the participants refrained from cleaning their teeth until 50% of their gingival units showed bleeding after gentle probing, but not longer than 15 days. samples were taken from serum and saliva, before and during the period of experimental gingivitis, and up to 8 weeks after the start of the experiment. a pattern with minor fluctuations in specific serum and salivary antibody activities was consistently found in all patients. this indicates that immunoregulatory mechanisms succeed in maintaining unchanged antibody levels when plaque load increases. a subgroup of participants with low mean numbers of bleeding gingival units after plaque accumulation, showed significantly higher salivary iga antibody levels reactive with s. mutans, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. saburreum, as compared with the subgroup reaching high bleeding after probing scores (p < 0.05). when 1 person with outlying values (p < 0.05) for p. gingivalis was excluded from the tests, the former group also showed statistically significant higher salivary antibody levels to this bacterial species. high levels of salivary iga directed against bacteria in dental plaque might thus protect against the development of gingivitis.

TI  == new findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == the predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'streptococcus milleri'-group, bacteroides ureolyticus, capnocytophaga ochracea, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, p. intermedia, p. oralis and unidentified prevotella  spp. two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. the large proportion of non-pigmented prevotella species, p. asaccharolytica and b. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. the role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.

TI  == serum immunoglobulin g antibodies to porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis during experimental gingivitis in young adults.
AB  == twenty-eight young, healthy adults completed an experimental gingivitis study in  which blood and clinical recordings were obtained at baseline; after a 4-week period of thorough oral hygiene; after a subsequent 3-week period of plaque accumulation; and after another 2 weeks of thorough oral hygiene. serum immunoglobulin g antibodies against whole cells of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mean serum immunoglobulin g antibody levels to p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and s. sanguis remained essentially constant during the experiment, whereas the immunoglobulin g antibodies to p. gingivalis declined during the initial period of oral hygiene and the subsequent period of plaque accumulation to an average of 84.5% of the baseline value. this reduction could be attributed to the people who developed marked gingival inflammation during the period of plaque accumulation, indicating that the systemic host response may be associated with local tissue responses to  variations in oral hygiene. these people were, however, also characterized by higher initial serum immunoglobulin g responses to p. gingivalis than people who  developed less pronounced gingival inflammation during the experiment. the variability and individuality noted in the host response to potential pathogens have important implications for attempts to use such measures for establishing a  diagnosis or prognosis for the individual patient.

AB  == subgingival plaque samples from patients with chronic periodontitis were exposed  to light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon laser for 30 s in the presence and absence of  50 micrograms/ml toluidine blue o as a photosensitizer. viable counts of various  groups and species of bacteria were carried out before and after irradiation. the median numbers of viable bacteria initially present in the 30-microliters aliquots irradiated were 1.13 x 10(5) cfu (aerobes), 4.08 x 10(5) cfu (anaerobes), 4.92 x 10(3) cfu (black-pigmented anaerobes), 4.75 x 10(2) cfu (porphyromonas gingivalis), 6.15 x 10(3) cfu (fusobacterium nucleatum) and 1.7 x  10(4) cfu (streptococci). the dye/laser combination achieved significant reductions in the viability of these organisms, the median reductions in the viable counts being 91.1% for aerobes, 96.6% for anaerobes, 100% for black-pigmented anaerobes, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum and 94.2% for streptococci. overall, the viability of bacteria in the 20 plaque samples was not significantly decreased by the dye alone. however, in a small minority of samples there were indications of light-independent, dye-induced toxicity. low-power lasers, in conjunction with appropriate photosensitizers, may be a useful adjunct to mechanical debridement in the treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases if a similar effectiveness against subgingival plaque bacteria can be achieved in vivo.

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections.
AB  == necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. the number of different species in one canal is usually low,  approx. 4-7 species. the species isolated most frequently belong to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and streptococcus. the frequency of isolation of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by pr. denticola and two porphyromonas species, p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis. several studies have shown that p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis are closely related to the presence  of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are not. however, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. moreover, porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. although porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.

AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. a further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. a total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. the periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. the results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for campylobacter rectus, 80% for fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for streptococcus sanguis, 72% for streptococcus mitis, 66% for eikenella corrodens,  58% for prevotella intermedia, 32% for capnocytophaga, 27% for selenomonas, 25% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for streptococcus mutans. small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring p. gingivalis, a. actinomytecomitans or  > 5% p. intermedia and the rest of the sample. similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.

TI  == modulation of intergeneric adhesion of oral bacteria by human saliva.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis adheres in vitro to biofilms containing streptococcus and actinomyces species. on initial entry to the mouth, this interbacterial adhesion may enable p. gingivalis to colonize dental plaque and to avoid clearance by saliva flow. saliva may also interfere directly with p. gingivalis colonization of dental plaque; a 43-kda glycoprotein in human submandibular-sublingual saliva binds to p. gingivalis surfaces and diminishes interbacterial adhesion activity. to avoid fouling of its surface by host components, p. gingivalis produces surface-localized proteases that can degrade adsorbed proteins and may serve to unmask bacterial adhesins. successful management of p. gingivalis colonization might be achieved in the future by devising artificial methods to block its surface adhesins or to prevent bacterial proteolysis of native salivary molecules that have protective functions.

AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the clinical and microbiological effects of topical application of a metronidazole gel and a single session of subgingival scaling in the treatment of adult periodontitis. an open, randomized controlled clinical study design was employed. each of 24 subjects received the 2 treatments simultaneously each in 2 randomly selected quadrants of the dentition. the metronidazole, 25% gel was applied subgingivally on days 0 and 7. scaling was carried out in one quadrant on day 0 and in one quadrant on day 7. clinical and microbiological examinations were carried out before treatment and on days 21, 49, 91, 133, and 175 of the experimental period. the microbiological analyses included determination of total anaerobically cultivable bacteria, and relative proportions of anaerobes, aerobes, black-pigmented anaerobic gram negative rods,  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococci, and spirochetes. both treatments were effective in reducing probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing. metronidazole tended to be a little better than scaling during the study period and the clinical effects of both treatments persisted during the whole 6 months observation period. local metronidazole treatment induced a significant and long-lasting shift in the subgingival flora towards a composition more compatible with health and comparable to that obtained by mechanical debridement. proportions of black pigmented anaerobes including prevotella intermedia, and the number of spirochetes were significantly reduced after both treatments with a concomitant increase in the proportions of streptococci. while scaling resulted in a statistically significant increase in the proportion of a. actinomycetemcomitans, this was avoided after metronidazole treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens on titanium implants and teeth in experimental gingivitis and periodontitis in beagle dogs.
AB  == the microflora around titanium implants and teeth in 4 beagle dogs was analyzed in order to follow the longitudinal development from healthy conditions to experimental gingivitis and periodontitis. a 2-month plaque control program was performed to establish healthy conditions on titanium implants and control teeth  (baseline, day 0). subgingival bacterial samples and radiographs were obtained. the plaque control was ceased and all measurements were repeated on day 21 (gingivitis). a new period of plaque control was initiated to re-establish healthy conditions (day 49). a cotton ligature was placed subgingivally around the implants and the control teeth to induce tissue breakdown. the ligatures were removed on day 91. the study was completed with registrations on day 121 (periodontitis). no significant microbiological difference was found between titanium implants and teeth in healthy conditions and in gingivitis and periodontitis. the mean total viable count increased 10 times on implants as well as on teeth. streptococci were dominating at baseline: 40.2% on implants and 60.6% on teeth and decreased in gingivitis to 11.7% and 5.4%. when periodontitis  had developed, the proportion of streptococci was < 1%. at baseline few porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia were detected. they increased  at gingivitis to 37.4% and 21.0%; when periodontitis developed, they comprised about 25.0%. microbial colonization and establishment on titanium implants with healthy gingiva, experimental gingivitis and periodontitis follow the same pattern as on teeth.

TI  == sensitization of oral bacteria to killing by low-power laser radiation.
AB  == twenty-seven compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize streptococcus sanguis to killing by light from a 7.3-mw helium/neon (hene) laser. bacteria were mixed with various concentrations of the test compounds, spread over the surfaces of agar plates, and then exposed to light from the hene laser for various time periods. the plates were then incubated and examined for zones of inhibition. those compounds found to be effective photosensitizers were then tested against porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. toluidine blue o, azure b chloride, and methylene blue at concentrations of 0.005% (wt/vol) were effective photosensitizers of all four species, enabling killing of bacteria following exposure to laser light for only  30 s.

TI  == immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of actinomyces, prevotella, porphyromonas, and fusobacterium.
AB  == immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. a total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of actinomyces, porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium. two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. the mean percentages of igg1, igg2, igm, and iga in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. elisa and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. the highest titers determined by elisa belonged to the igg1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. the concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by elisa and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. the functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of actinomyces, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, prevotella, streptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, actinobacillus,  haemophilus, capnocytophaga, and wolinella. minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. high-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.

TI  == characterization of the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  == adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis deposited on nitrocellulose paper was investigated. a variety of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of p. gingivalis bound to both s. sanguis and s. mitis. binding of p. gingivalis to all but one of the streptococci was not inhibited by salivary molecules. pretreatment of p. gingivalis with periodate and pretreatment of s. sanguis and s. mitis with pronase decreased binding, suggesting that adherence may be mediated by a protein on the streptococci interacting with a carbohydrate on p. gingivalis. binding was not inhibited by a selection of simple sugars. the ability to adhere to early plaque  bacteria such as s. sanguis and s. mitis may be important in the colonization of  the mouth by p. gingivalis.

AB  == the present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. at each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species  detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. species enumerated were; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, p.  micros, s. intermedius, s. sanguis i and ii, v. parvula and w. recta. total viable counts and counts of capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the  primary isolation plates. a total of 1581 samples were evaluated. subject visits  with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of b.  intermedius i and p. micros, and lower mean %s of capnocytophaga sp. sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of b. intermedius i and  ii, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and b. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often  at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. the 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == humoral igg antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis adhesion to streptococcus gordonii by human submandibular-sublingual saliva.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis w50 adheres in vitro to biofilms of streptococcus gordonii g9b. this phenomenon is believed to facilitate the initial colonization  of the oral cavity by p. gingivalis and to contribute to the maturation of dental plaque. in this report, we describe the modulating effects of human submandibular-sublingual saliva (hsmsl) on this in vitro model of intergeneric bacterial adhesion (coaggregation). hsmsl inhibited p. gingivalis adhesion to s.  gordonii by 50% at a concentration of 57 micrograms of protein per ml. maximum inhibitory activity was associated with a 43-kda protein obtained by sequential sephadex g200 gel filtration and cm52 ion-exchange chromatography of hsmsl. pools of other column fractions of hsmsl showed no effect or were slightly stimulatory  for bacterial adhesion. the binding of radioiodinated column fractions containing the 43-kda protein by p. gingivalis was accompanied by their rapid enzymatic degradation. treating p. gingivalis at 60 degrees c for 30 min or with protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sodium iodoacetate) reduced adherence to streptococcal biofilms. these treatments did not prevent p. gingivalis from binding soluble hsmsl saliva components, although subsequent proteolysis was nearly eliminated. these observations indicate that surface-associated proteases of p. gingivalis, either independently or in concert with adjacent surface adhesins, interact with surfaces of oral streptococci to facilitate interbacterial adhesion. the adhesion-blocking properties of hsmsl, particularly the 43-kda protein, may represent an important host defense mechanism in the oral cavity.

AB  == the present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. the mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). the probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. the % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; v. parvula, 98; b. intermedius i, 98; s. sanguis ii, 96; b. intermedius ii, 95; c. ochracea, 94; b. gingivalis, 91; s. sanguis i, 85; w. recta, 83; f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; s. intermedius, 80; b. forsythus, 76; p. micros, 74; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and  a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. the % of sites colonized by each of the  14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. the median number  of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for v. parvula. in half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than  4%. when subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

TI  == relation of counts of microbial species to clinical status at the sampled site.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to relate clinical characteristics at a site to the frequency of detection, absolute counts and proportions of 14 subgingival species. subgingival plaque samples were removed by curette from the  mesial surface of 2299 teeth in 3 healthy and 87 subjects with periodontal attachment loss. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to identify colonies of each test species. measurements of pocket depth, attachment level, recession, redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration were made at each sampled site. total viable  counts at sites ranged from 10(3) to greater than 10(8) and were strongly related to pocket depth. mean total counts at sites less than 3 mm averaged 4.6 x 10(6),  while mean counts at sites greater than 7 mm averaged 2.0 x 10(7). species enumerated and % of sites colonized were as follows; v. parvula 44; s. sanguis ii 36; b. intermedius i 33; c. ochracea 31; b. intermedius ii 30; s. sanguis i 29; b. gingivalis 27; s. intermedius 25; p. micros 24; w. recta 23; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 18; b. forsythus 15; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 10; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 8. counts of b. intermedius ii were higher at sites which exhibited gingival redness while b. intermedius i was higher at sites which bled on probing. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b was more frequent and  at higher mean % at sites without recession. the opposite was true for s. sanguis ii. b. gingivalis was somewhat more prevalent and at higher levels at suppurating sites. b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii and b. forsythus were found more frequently and at higher levels at sites with deeper pockets, while v. parvula was less prevalent at sites with pocket depths less than 4 mm. b. gingivalis, b.  intermedius i and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b increased with increasing pocket depth in both localized and widespread disease subjects, but mean counts were higher in the localized disease subjects at any pocket depth. only w. recta  was found at higher levels at deep sites in widespread disease subjects when compared with similar sites in localized disease subjects. no suspected pathogens were detected in 38% of shallow sites, 31% of intermediate sites and 22% of deep  sites, 2/3 of deep pockets, but less than 1/2 of shallow pockets harbored at least 2 of the suspected pathogens.

TI  == identification and sequence analysis of a methylase gene in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == a gene from the periodontal organism porphyromonas gingivalis has been identified as encoding a dna methylase. the gene, referred to as pgiim, has been sequenced and found to contain a reading frame of 864 basepairs. the putative amino acid sequence of the encoded methylase was 288 amino acids, and shared 47% and 31% homology with the streptococcus pneumoniae dpnii and e. coli dam methylases, respectively. the activity and specificity of the pgi methylase (m.pgii) was confirmed by cloning the gene into a dam- strain of e. coli (jm110) and performing a restriction analysis on the isolated dna with enzymes whose activities depended upon the methylation state of the dna. the data indicated that m.pgii, like dpnii and dam, methylated the adenine residue within the sequence 5'-gatc-3'.

TI  == microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  == animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. the rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of  periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues  with ligatures. experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). the studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus are  associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. however, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. in the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.

TI  == adherence of porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis to streptococcus sanguis in vitro.
AB  == intergeneric bacterial adherence is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to enable some extraneous bacteria to initially colonize the human oral cavity. some current evidence indicates that streptococcus sanguis, an early colonizer of teeth, enhances subsequent colonization by porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, a bacterium associated with advanced adult periodontitis. in this study, selected strains of  p. gingivalis and s. sanguis were tested for their adherence activities in vitro. a differential filtration assay was devised in which one member of the test pair  was radiolabeled. heterogeneous aggregates that formed in mixed suspensions were  collected on polycarbonate filters (8-microns pore size) and were washed free of  individual bacteria and small homologous clumps. p. gingivalis 381, w50, jkg7, and 33277 adhered to s. sanguis g9b, m5, challis 6, and 38. p. gingivalis a7a1-28 did not adhere well to s. sanguis under these conditions. more precise measurements of intergeneric adherence were obtained with an alternative assay with radiolabeled p. gingivalis and an artificial dental plaque composed of s. sanguis coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose beads. cnbr-agarose was selected as the supporting matrix for the plaque because it was uniformly and permanently coated with s. sanguis and because p. gingivalis had negligible adherence activity for streptococcus-free beads. p. gingivalis w50 grown to the early stationary phase adhered to s. sanguis-coated beads in higher numbers than  either midlogarithmic- or late-stationary-phase cells. intergeneric adherence was not inhibited or reversed by the presence of lactose or other monosaccharides or  disaccharides. pretreatment of either bacterium with trypsin or proteinase k reduced subsequent adherence by 86 to 100%. neuraminidase treatment of p. gingivalis caused 98% reduction of adherence, whereas similar treatment of s. sanguis caused only a 2% loss. preincubation of p. gingivalis at 60 degrees c for 30 min decreased subsequent adherence to s. sanguis-coated beads by 94%. adherence was reduced by 96% when bacteria were assayed while suspended in human  whole saliva or when pretreated with saliva and subsequently assayed in buffer. the concentration of whole human saliva required to inhibit 50% adherence in this assay was 23 micrograms per ml (1:200 dilution). suspension of the bacteria in normal rabbit serum resulted in 94% inhibition of adherence. these data indicate  that saliva and serum may be important host defense factors for controlling porphyromonas-streptococcus adherence.

AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == the rna polymerases of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the rna polymerase of escherichia coli.
AB  == western blot analysis that used antisera to the e. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the rna polymerase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. both antisera reacted with proteins in a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans whole-cell extracts. reactions were seen with some f. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core rna polymerase antisera were used,  but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. no reaction with f. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to e. coli sigma factor. there were no cross-reacting proteins detected in p. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. these results suggest that e. coli rna polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase for e. coli rna polymerase to recognize p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum promoters. partially purified p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase exhibited a specificity for a p. gingivalis dna template, while having a decreased activity from an e. coli dna template. the antibiotic sensitivity profile of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of e. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. we conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum genes in e. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.

TI  == the formation of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan by oral bacteria.
AB  == the capacity to form volatile sulfur compounds was tested in bacteria isolated from subgingival microbiotas and in a representative number of reference strains. a majority of the 75 tested oral bacterial species and 7 unnamed bacterial taxa formed significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine. the most active bacteria were found in the genera peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, selenomonas, centipeda, bacteroides and fusobacterium. methyl mercaptan from l-methionine was  formed by some members of the genera fusobacterium, bacteroides, porphyromonas and eubacterium. when incubated in serum for 7 d, the most potent producers of hydrogen sulfide were treponema denticola and the black-pigmented species, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loescheii, porphyromonas endodontalis and porphyromonas gingivalis. p. endodontalis and p. gingivalis also produced significant amounts of methyl mercaptan in serum. no other volatile sulfur compound was detected in serum or in the presence of l-cysteine and l-methionine. these findings significantly increase the list of oral bacteria known to produce  volatile sulfur compounds.

TI  == [ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro].
AB  == this study was designed to analyze the succession of an ecosystem of microbial flora in periodontal pockets, in vitro. bacterial strains used in this study, were fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, porphyromonas gingivalis 381, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mutans omz 176. the bacterial  cells, associated with beneficial, pathogenic or plaque forming activity, were cultured in brain heart infusion medium including hemin, vitamin-k1, l-cysteine hydrochloride and sodium thioglycollate under anaerobic condition (n2: 80%, co2:  10%, h2: 10%). the effect of environmental eh and ph on the growth of bacterial cells was investigated in single and mixed culture, and eh and ph tolerance tests were also undertaken. the environmental ph decreased from ph 7.0 to ph 4.9 accompanied with the growth of s. mutans omz 176 and s. sanguis atcc 10557 in both single and mixed culture. the environmental eh increased from -308 mv to -180 mv accompanied with the growth of s. sanguis atcc 10557. the growth of pathogenic bacteria, such as f. nucleatum atcc 10953 and p. gingivalis 381, varied markedly with eh and ph. especially, the growth of p. gingivalis 381 was severely inhibited at or below ph 6.0 in an acid tolerance test, whereas the growth of f. nucleatum atcc 10953 was strongly inhibited at eh -100 mv in an eh tolerance test. the oxygen generation (10.8%) was confirmed in the anaerobic culture of s. sanguis atcc 10557. therefore, it was suggested that hydrogen peroxide produced by s. sanguis atcc 10557 was reduced to oxygen and water. these results suggest that the high eh and the low ph generated from bacterial metabolism is a powerful determinant in ecology of microbial flora in periodontal pockets.

TI  == effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius.
AB  == the effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of the type strain and fresh isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius was investigated. b. intermedius strains grew with and without glucose at a ph as low as 5.0. these bacteria grew almost as well as streptococcus mutans at ph 5.0 and  better than actinomyces viscosus at ph 5.5 and 5.0. some b. intermedius strains raised the culture ph when grown at a low ph without glucose. in contrast, p. gingivalis strains grew only at ph 6.5 to 7.0. the p. gingivalis strains had proteolytic activities against azocoll, azocasein, and azoalbumin, while the b. intermedius strains degraded azocasein and azoalbumin, but not azocoll. b. intermedius showed maximum proteolytic activity at ph 7.0, and high activity over a wide ph range. in contrast, the optimum ph of proteolytic activity in p. gingivalis was ph 7.5 to 8.0. the p. gingivalis activities were more sensitive than those of b. intermedius to low ph. the capacity of b. intermedius to degrade proteins to more readily metabolizable substrates at low ph might explain the growth of this bacterium in an acidic environment. these differences between b. intermedius and p. gingivalis could explain their capacity to survive at different sites in the oral cavity and indicate how b. intermedius might positively influence the growth of p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.
