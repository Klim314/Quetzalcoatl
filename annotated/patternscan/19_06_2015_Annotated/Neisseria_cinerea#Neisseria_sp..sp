TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == prevalence and persistence of neisseria cinerea and other neisseria spp. in adults.
AB  == neisseria cinerea is a commensal neisseria sp. which was first described in 1906  but was subsequently misclassified as a subtype of branhamella catarrhalis. n. cinerea resembles neisseria gonorrhoeae in both cultural and biochemical characteristics and, thus, may also have been misidentified as n. gonorrhoeae. of 202 patients whose oropharynges were colonized by neisseria spp., n. cinerea was  isolated in 57 (28.2%) patients, including 25 (30.1%) of 83 women, 22 (23.9%) of  92 heterosexual men, and 10 (37.0%) of 27 homosexual men in seattle, wash., in 1983 to 1984. n. cinerea was isolated from the urethra of only one (1.1%) patient. the oropharynges of many individuals were colonized persistently by strains of n. cinerea and other neisseria spp.

TI  == evaluation of eight methods for identification of pathogenic neisseria species: neisseria-kwik, rim-n, gonobio-test, minitek, gonochek ii, gonogen, phadebact monoclonal gc omni test, and syva microtrak test.
AB  == the performance of eight methods in identifying neisseria species, particularly n. gonorrhoeae, was evaluated. these methods included four rapid carbohydrate utilization tests (gonobio-test, neisseria-kwik, rim-n, and minitek); the gonochek ii, a test which is based on the utilization of chromogenic substrates;  and three monoclonal antibody tests (syva microtrak, gonogen, and phadebact monoclonal gc omni test). in all, 182 isolates comprised in six species of neisseria as well as branhamella catarrhalis and moraxella sp. were tested. cystine-tryptic digest agar supplemented with sugars was included for reference purposes. in the carbohydrate utilization tests, the sensitivity and specificity  of the neisseria-kwik and minitek tests for the identification of n. gonorrhoeae  were 100%. this compared with sensitivities and specificities, respectively, of 100 and 99.1% for the gonobio-test and 99.1 and 100% for cystine-tryptic digest agar sugars and the rim-n test. the sensitivity and specificity of the gonochek ii test were 99.0 and 86.7%, respectively. although most test kits did not claim  to identify all neisseria species, in several cases isolates of n. subflava were  misidentified or could be misinterpreted as n. gonorrhoeae or n. meningitidis. with the monoclonal reagents, the syva microtrak system was 100% sensitive and 100% specific. the gonogen test was both 99.1% sensitive and specific, while the  phadebact monoclonal gc omni test was 99.1% sensitive but 91.2% specific. with this latter test, cross-reactions were observed with strains of b. catarrhalis, n. cinerea, and n. lactamica.

TI  == proctitis associated with neisseria cinerea misidentified as neisseria gonorrhoeae in a child.
AB  == an 8-year-old boy developed proctitis. rectal swabs yielded a neisseria sp. that  was repeatedly identified by api (analytab products, plainview, n.y.), minitek (bbl microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.), and bactec (johnston laboratories, towson, md.) methods as neisseria gonorrhoeae. subsequent testing in a reference  laboratory yielded an identification of neisseria cinerea. it is suggested that identification of a neisseria sp. isolated from genital or rectal sites in a child be confirmed by additional serological, growth, and antibiotic susceptibility tests and, if necessary, by a reference laboratory. the implications of such misidentifications are discussed.
