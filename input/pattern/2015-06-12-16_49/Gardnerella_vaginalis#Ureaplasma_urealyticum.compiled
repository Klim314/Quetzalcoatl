TI  - Severe pelvic abscess formation following caesarean section.
AB  - We report a case of a 24-year-old woman with severe pelvic abscess formation 2 weeks after secondary caesarean section. The isolated pathogens were a mixture of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. After initial resistance to systemic antibiotic treatment, she underwent radiologically-guided drainage of the abscesses, whereon she had a continuous recovery.
TI  - [Semen quality and its influencing factors in preconception males in Nanjing area].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the semen quality and its influencing factors in preconception males in Nanjing area so as to provide some evidence for working out effective intervention measures. METHODS: Totally 687 men receiving preconceptional physical examination were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire survey was conducted among the subjects along with an analysis of their semen quality. RESULTS: The median of sperm concentration was 63.3 x 10(6)/ml (95% CI [19.88-119] x 10(6)/ml). The median of grade a sperm was 33.03% (95% CI [19.38-55.05]%), that of grade a + b sperm was 52.08% (95% CI [39.53-69.37]%), and that of teratosperm was 91.75% (95% CI [69-100]%). The median concentration of seminal plasma PMN-elastase was 195.55 ng/ml (95% CI [76.16-3330.38] ng/ml) and that of seminal plasma zinc was 7.62 mumol/L (95% CI [1.5-23, 45] mumol/L). The positive rates of Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), and Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) were 42.4%, 0.3%, and 2.4%, respectively. The median of sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) of those whose wives had a history of adverse pregnancy was 20.25% (95% CI [2.15-68.25]%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that mental stress (OR 1.567, 95% CI [1.081-2.27]) and sedentariness (OR 1.772, 95% CI [1.211-2.592]) were independent risk factors for asthenospermia. CONCLUSION: The sperm quality of preconception males in Nanjing area is not encouraging, and it can be improved by changing undesirable lifestyle and reducing mental stress.
TI  - Clinical chorioamnionitis at term I: microbiology of the amniotic cavity using cultivation and molecular techniques.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the amniotic fluid (AF) microbiology of patients with the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis at term using both cultivation and molecular techniques; and 2) to examine the relationship between intra-amniotic inflammation with and without microorganisms and placental lesions consistent with acute AF infection. METHODS: The AF samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 46 women with clinical signs of chorioamnionitis at term were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anerobic bacteria as well as genital mycoplasmas) and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The frequency of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC), intra-amniotic inflammation [defined as an AF interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration >/=2.6 ng/mL], and placental lesions consistent with acute AF infection (acute histologic chorioamnionitis and/or acute funisitis) were examined according to the results of AF cultivation and PCR/ESI-MS as well as AF IL-6 concentrations. RESULTS: 1) Culture identified bacteria in AF from 46% (21/46) of the participants, whereas PCR/ESI-MS was positive for microorganisms in 59% (27/46) - combining these two tests, microorganisms were detected in 61% (28/46) of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term. Eight patients had discordant test results; one had a positive culture and negative PCR/ESI-MS result, whereas seven patients had positive PCR/ESI-MS results and negative cultures. 2) Ureaplasma urealyticum (n=8) and Gardnerella vaginalis (n=10) were the microorganisms most frequently identified by cultivation and PCR/ESI-MS, respectively. 3) When combining the results of AF culture, PCR/ESI-MS and AF IL-6 concentrations, 15% (7/46) of patients did not have intra-amniotic inflammation or infection, 6.5% (3/46) had only MIAC, 54% (25/46) had microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, and 24% (11/46) had intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms. 4) Placental lesions consistent with acute AF infection were significantly more frequent in patients with microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation [70.8% (17/24) vs. 28.6% (2/7); P=0.04]. CONCLUSION: Microorganisms in the AF were identified in 61% of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term; 54% had microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, whereas 24% had intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms.
TI  - Performance evaluation of a DNA chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. STDetect(R) Chip is a DNA chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13 major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. We evaluated the analytical performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. METHODS: The target pathogens of the STDetect(R) Chip are Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex PCR assay. And precision tests for STDetect(R) Chip were performed with quality control materials. RESULTS: The STDetect(R) Chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. The STDetect(R) Chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. Comparing to multiplex PCR assay, STDetect(R) Chip showed better sensitivity for detecting M. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and U. urealyticum (93.2% vs. 65.9%). In precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. CONCLUSION: The STDetect(R) Chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.
TI  - Characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy Canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. Understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. During a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth, colonization, and community structure. The objective of this study was to assess the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy Canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. Vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. Amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. Samples were also assayed for total 16S rRNA gene content and Gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative PCR and screened for the presence of Mollicutes by using family and genus-specific PCR. RESULTS: Overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. Microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. Clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus jensenii. Interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either Bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. Direct G. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and Mollicutes, including Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. Of interest in these findings was the presence of Bifidobacteriales beyond just Gardnerella species. Bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16S rRNA gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.
TI  - Bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexually transmitted infections are a significant cause of genital disease, infertility and hospital admissions. The economic impact is high. An accurate diagnosis is often difficult and time consuming. We report the development and validation of a novel bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling (STIP) assay that detects 18 sexually transmitted infections using a multiplex PCR followed by Luminex bead-based hybridisation. METHODS: STIP was validated using urogenital samples pretested by commercially available quantitative PCR, microscopy or by culturing methods. RESULTS: STIP specifically detects Chlamydia trachomatis, Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma (M.) genitalium, M. hominis, M. pneumonia, M. spermatophilum, Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. parvum, and quantifies bacterial vaginosis-associated Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis as well as three Candida species and normal genital flora-associated Lactobacillus species. STIP reached an overall concordance of 95-100% with commercially available quantitative PCR tests. Compared to Nugent score, STIP reached a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 86% for bacterial vaginosis detection. Candida specimens, pretested by direct culturing, were identified with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: STIP is a powerful high-throughput tool in assessing a broad spectrum of urogenital infections.
TI  - Vaginal infections among pregnant women at Omdurman Maternity Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. This study aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between August and December 2008 at Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. Vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct Gram smear, Nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS program version 12.0.1. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, BV was detected in 49.8%, followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and Candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and Trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). Higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). No significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and C. trachomatis infections was found. Gentamicin was the most active agent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clarythromycin was the most active against Mycoplasma species. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. Such cases may require specific medication. Routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.

TI  - Human papillomavirus and other genital infections in indigenous women from Paraguay: a cross-sectional analytical study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of cervical cancer in Paraguay is among the highest in  the world, with the human papillomavirus (HPV) being a necessary factor for cervical cancer. Knowledge about HPV infection among indigenous women is limited. This cross-sectional study analyzed the frequency of HPV and other genital infections in indigenous Paraguayan women of the Department of Presidente Hayes. METHODS: This study included 181 sexually active women without cervical lesions. They belonged to the following ethnicities: Maka (n = 40); Nivacle (n = 23); Sanapana (n = 33); Enxet Sur (n = 51) and Toba-Qom (n = 34). The detection of HPV and other gynecological infectious microorganisms was performed by either molecular methods (for Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis), gram staining and/or culture (for Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida sp, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae), serological methods (for Treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) or cytology (cervical inflammation). RESULTS: A high prevalence (41.4%) of women positive for at least one sexually transmitted infection (STI) was found (23.2% any-type HPV, 11.6% T pallidum, 10.5% T vaginalis, 9.9% C trachomatis and 0.6% HIV) with 12.2% having more than one STI. HPV infection was the most frequent, with 16.1% of women positive for high-risk HPV types. There was a statistically significant association observed between any-type HPV and C trachomatis (p = 0.004), which indicates that the detection of one of these agents should suggest the presence of the other. There was no association between any-type HPV and other genital infections or cervical inflammation, suggesting that other mechanism could exist to favor infection with the virus. CONCLUSION: This multidisciplinary work suggests that STIs are frequent, making it necessary to implement control measures and improve diagnosis in order to increase the number of cases detected, especially in populations with poor access to health centers.
TI  - Microbial and vaginal determinants influencing Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma  urealyticum genital colonization in a population of female patients.
AB  - Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum are associated with chorioamnionitis, preterm delivery and pelvic inflammatory disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible risk factors of co-colonization by M. hominis in patients already colonized by U. urealyticum and compare demographic parameters, vaginal pH and microbiota of women colonized by U. urealyticum or M. hominis. A total of 452 patients positive for U. urealyticum or M. hominis were analysed, 421 (93.1%) of whom were positive for U. urealyticum and 31 (6.9%) for M. hominis. Patients positive for M. hominis compared to patients positive for U. urealyticum were more frequently colonized by Gardnerella vaginalis (71% vs 18.5%; p 0.0001), less frequently by lactobacilli (16.1% vs 61.5%; p 0.0001), and more frequently had a pH value higher than 4.5 (96.8% vs 57%; p 0.0001), all conditions associated to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Logistic regression analysis showed that only G. vaginalis colonization and pH higher than 4.5 were independently related to M. hominis colonization (respectively p 0.0001 and p 0.016). Thus, in women colonized by U. urealyticum, BV is an independent risk factor for M. hominis co-colonization.
TI  - Plants traditionally used individually and in combination to treat sexually transmitted infections in northern Maputaland, South Africa: antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Although medicinal plants are used extensively to treat sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in rural northern Maputaland, KwaZulu-Natal, the efficacy and safety of these plants have not previously been evaluated. AIM OF STUDY: A study was designed to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity profiles of a selection (individual plants and selected combinations) of traditionally used plants in this study area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous and organic (dichloromethane: methanol, 1:1) extracts were prepared. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay against the STI associated pathogens; Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Ureaplasma urealyticum clinical strain, Oligella ureolytica ATCC 43534, Trichomonas vaginalis clinical strain, Gardnerella vaginalis ATCC 14018 and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 19424. For the combination study, interactions were assessed using the fractional inhibitory concentration (SigmaFIC). The plant species were assessed for safety using the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cellular viability assay on the human embryonic kidney epithelial (Graham, HEK-293) cell line. RESULTS: For the antimicrobial studies, U. urealyticum was the most sensitive of the six test organisms, with the aqueous extract of Ranunculus multifidus (0.02mg/ml) and the organic extract of Peltophorum africanum (0.04mg/ml) being the most antimicrobially active plant species studied. Sclerocarya birrea was found to have the broadest spectrum of activity (mean MIC of 0.89mg/ml). The only plant species to exhibit some degree of cytotoxicity against the kidney epithelial cell line was Kigelia africana (100microg/ml), with 22% and 16% cell death for the aqueous and organic extracts, respectively. Of the 13 combinations studied, several synergistic combinations were evident, the most prominent being the combination of Albizia adianthifolia and Trichilia dregeana (aqueous extract) with an SigmaFIC value of 0.15 against O. ureolytica. Synergistic interactions were observed regardless of the ratio of the aqueous mixtures of the two plants. Syzygium cordatum and S. birrea (aqueous extract) was also a combination of interest, demonstrating synergistic (SigmaFIC=0.42) interactions against O. ureolytica. This combination, however, also displayed some cytotoxicity towards the human epithelial cell line. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that anecdotal evidence of plant use does not always correlate with in vitro activity. Furthermore, the toxicological profiling is of utmost importance as if not combined in its correct ratio can lead to potential adverse effects.
TI  - Bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern Poland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already given birth to healthy children. The material for the presence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominis and U. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by PCR. Furthermore, BD ProbeTec ET system was used to detect C. trachomatis infection. Vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the Nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. RESULTS: U. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of controls. Presence of M. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and C. trachomatis only in latter (3%). N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium were not found in any of the examined women. The frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. There were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. BV develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.
TI  - Fetal membrane biomarker network diversity and disease functions induced by intra-amniotic pathogens.
AB  - PROBLEM: Intra-amniotic pathogens and by-products activate innate immune responses encompassing multitudes of signaling molecules and pathways that can result in spontaneous preterm birth (PTB). This study investigates fetal membrane response to bacterial stimulation using a bioinformatics approach. METHOD OF STUDY: Dysregulated biomarker (IL1-beta, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha) data from fetal membranes at term stimulated with Ureaplasma urealyticum, Ureaplasma parvum, Mycoplasma hominis, E. coli, Group B Streptococci, Polyporhans gingivalis, or Gardnerella vaginalis with 50% (v/v) amniotic fluid (AF) were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: In racially stratified analysis, networks representing late-stage immune inflammation were seen in African-Americans in AF absence. Inflammation was dominant in AF presence as well. In Caucasians, late-stage immune response was dominant with AF, but not in its absence. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal membrane biofunctions in response to bacteria reflect early- and late-stage innate immune defenses that vary based on the presence of AF and subject race.
TI  - Simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  - Our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot assay. We have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. In this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. The 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were Trichomonas vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, M. genitalium, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. Two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. The method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. In a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in Sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the 14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.
TI  - Amniotic fluid and maternal race influence responsiveness of fetal membranes to bacteria.
AB  - Spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pPROM) occur more frequently in African-American women than in other racial groups. This may be due to an enhanced inflammatory response to pathogens associated with the condition. It is also possible that amniotic fluid (AF) has different immunomodulatory properties in African-American women that increase their risk of PTB and pPROM. To test this, we cultured fetal membranes from European-American and African-American women with sterile medium (control), Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Group B streptococci (GBS), Polyporphorans gingivalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum or Ureaplasma parvum in the presence and absence of 50% autologous AF. Cytokine concentrations were quantified in the conditioned medium. All bacterial species increased IL-8 production. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production were stimulated by LPS, E. coli, and G. vaginalis compared with control, but responses to Group B streptococci and P. gingivalis were limited to IL-1beta and TNF-alpha respectively. Genital mycoplasmas stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-10 but had no effect on IL-1beta production. African-Americans had twice the IL-1beta response to E. coli as European-Americans (P=0.031). Conversely, European-Americans produced more IL-8 in response to LPS than African-Americans (P=0.026). AF had both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that varied between races and pathogens. These results suggest that the host response to fetal membrane infections is complex and not generalizable. Interventions to prevent PTB and pPROM may need to be customized based on a patient's race, type of bacterial infection and factors in her AF.
TI  - Bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane Toll-like receptor expression.
AB  - PROBLEM: Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pPROM) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (PTB) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection and inflammation. The membranes may sense and respond to microbes via Toll-like receptors (TLRs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation in this tissue. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of TLRs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and PTB. METHOD OF STUDY: Normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. After 24 hrs, RNA was extracted and quantitative RT-PCR performed for TLRs1-10. RESULTS: Treatment of fetal membranes with Mycoplasma hominis increased expression of TLR4, TLR6, and TLR8 mRNA. Ureaplasma parvum upregulated TLR8 mRNA, and Porphyromonas gingivalis significantly increased fetal membrane TLR7 expression. In contrast, treatment with Gram-negative Escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated TLR10 mRNA. No effect was detected for Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, or Group B Streptococcus. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane TLR expression patterns. Moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pPROM and PTB, arise.
TI  - Preserved ex vivo inflammatory status in decidual cells from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the inflammatory response preserved ex vivo by decidual cells isolated from women who experienced preterm labor with and without subclinical intrauterine infection. METHODS: Fetal membranes were obtained after cesarean section from 35 women who delivered before 37 weeks of gestation following spontaneous preterm labor, with no clinical evidence of intrauterine infection. Decidua was microbiologically tested and cultured. Concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9) were measured in the supernatants using Bio-Plex, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Subclinical infection was confirmed in 10 women (28.5%). Microorganisms isolated were Ureaplasma urealyticum (4), group B streptococci (3), Gardnerella vaginalis (1), and Escherichia coli (2). We found a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines in supernatants from decidual cells obtained from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection compared to women without infection. Secretion of MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-9 and PGE(2) was significantly higher in infected women. Secretion of IL-8 by decidual cells from infected women persisted upon repeated in vitro culture passages. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 30% of idiopathic preterm labor cases were associated with subclinical intrauterine infection, and decidual cells isolated from these cases preserved an ex vivo inflammatory status after in vivo bacterial exposure.
TI  - [Possible role of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  - Vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. It is due to several causes, some even unknown. Bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. They have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. The identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. In 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Candida albicans, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Streptococcus agalactiae. B. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. These strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees C in anaerobe chambers. Supernatant activity was assayed in HT-29 cells. Eighteen B. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. It was not identified in healthy women (P < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. This fact suggests that enterotoxigenic B. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. The effect of enterotoxin on E-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. This is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.
TI  - [Effect of combined therapy using complex of natural cytokines and antimicrobial  peptides in urogenital infections caused by Chlamydia and Mycoplasma].
AB  - AIM: To study efficacy of complex therapy of urogenital infections caused by Chlamydia and Mycoplasma using immunomodulator Superlimph. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty males and thirty six females ages 22 - 47 years old with chronic urogenital infections--cervicitis and vulvovaginitis (females), prostatitis (males)--were studied. PCR and bacteriologic methods were used for diagnostics of mixed infection and microbiota efficiency. Patients were divided on 3 groups according to treatment protocol. Twenty patients (group 1)--standard therapy (josamycin), 48 patients received immunomodulator (suppositorium) before treatment with josamycin (group 2), 18 patients were simultaneously treated with josamycin and immunomodulator (group 3). RESULTS: Combinations of Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium were identified in 30 - 35% of cases before treatment. After treatment with josamycin (group 1) or simultaneous therapy with josamycin and immunomodulator (group 3) considerable suppression of growth and elimination of both main pathogens and members of microbiota. Use of immunomodulator (group 2) in some cases resulted elimination of main pathogens and associated opportunistic microflora. CONCLUSION: Microbiological monitoring in 97% cases demonstrated therapeutic effect of immunomodulator Superlymph on urogenital infections associated with Chlamydia and Mycoplasma and disbiotic microbiota of urogenital tract.
TI  - HIV-infected women of Burkina Faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 HIV-positive compared to 200 HIV-negative women at the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service of Saint Camille Medical Center Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). METHODOLOGY: After revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: Among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, we identified respectively: Mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus 5.5%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection M. hominis with U. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); Candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); E. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. The Nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of BV, was significantly higher in HIV-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxitocica, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence ranging from 0% to 5%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the HIV-positive women of Burkina Faso are frequently affected by BV and represent a reservoir for mycoplasma infection. Since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.

AB  - This study used a previously described multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. First-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in Sydney, Australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. One hundred and sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly G. vaginalis and Ureaplasma spp. The prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. Of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. Only G. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (P = 0.05). The specificity of the mPCR/RLB assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. The mean sensitivities of the mPCR/RLB assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. There were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis and H. influenzae, although all were found infrequently. Overall, the mPCR/RLB platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.
TI  - Subtle perturbations of genital microflora alter mucosal immunity among low-risk  pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alteration in the vaginal flora has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of changes in individual microflora on genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women in early pregnancy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Large, tertiary care, academic hospital clinic. POPULATION: Low-risk women were enrolled prior to 14 weeks' gestation. METHODS: Women were included if they had no medical or previous obstetrical complications, were non-smokers, had no sexually transmitted infections and no intercourse in the last 48 hours. Consenting women underwent speculum examination for collection of vaginal culture and Dacron swabs for cytokine analysis. Semi-quantitative vaginal cultures were performed in a reference laboratory. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Concentrations of immune mediators were compared in the presence of various organisms. Concentrations were converted to multiples of the median to standardize the values of each mediator. Regression analyses were performed to control for race. RESULTS: We enrolled 47 women. The frequencies of genital microorganisms were: H(2)O(2) -producing lactobacilli (70%), Ureaplasma urealyticum (66%), Gardnerella vaginalis (45%), anaerobic non-pigmented Gram-negative rods (ANPGNR, 40%), anaerobic pigmented Gram-negative rods (APGNR, 17%). After adjusting for race and body mass index, interleukin-1beta, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor were increased in the presence of G. vaginalis, ANPGNR, and APGNR. There was no consistent impact on the other markers of immune activation. CONCLUSION: The presence of individual species impacts genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women. Perturbations in genital immunity could partially explain heterogeneity in adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - Prevalence of genital Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Gardnerella, and human papillomavirus in Japanese men with urethritis, and risk factors for detection of urethral human papillomavirus infection.
AB  - To analyze the risk factors for HPV infection in the urethra, we examined the prevalence of various microorganisms, for example Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Ureaplasma parvum, Gardnerella vaginalis, and human papillomavirus (HPV) in Japanese male patients with urethritis, and investigated their sexual backgrounds. Rubbed samples obtained from the distal urethra and questionnaires regarding sexual activity and demographic information were collected from 176 participants. N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, U. parvum, G. vaginalis, and HPV were detected in 19, 26, 18, 12, 12, 8.5, 14, and 20%, respectively, of all cases in this study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that more than 4 sexual partners within the last year and presence of N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis and/or M. genitalium infections were independent risk factors for urethral HPV infection, with odds ratios of 3.85 (95% CI 1.49-9.94) and 2.41 (95% CI 1.03-5.61), respectively. It is likely that urethral HPV detection is associated with current sexual activity and the presence of N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and/or M. genitalium infections.
TI  - Bacterial species present in the lower male genital tract: a five-year retrospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify bacterial species present in the lower genital tract of males and to investigate the relationship with semen quality. METHODS: The microscopic analyses and cultures of 696 semen specimens, collected over five years from males investigated for subfertility, were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: Semen cultures were sterile in 48%; they showed a polymicrobial flora (more than two bacterial species) in 30%, and were positive (>1 x 10(3) colony forming units/ml) in 22% of the cases. Gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by Escherichia coli and Enterococcus sp. Ureaplasma urealyticum was recovered from 13 of 147 samples (9%). Of patients with bacteriospermia 42% had leukospermia (>10(6) leukocytes/ml of semen). Bacteriospermia and leukospermia did not correlate with each other although a positive correlation was found between the presence of leukocytes and G. vaginalis isolation. Semen parameters were correlated with the bacterial species isolated most frequently. In comparison with controls, sperm concentration, motility and morphology were mostly deteriorated in the presence of G. vaginalis and U. urealyticum. CONCLUSIONS: Positive seminal fluid cultures must be interpreted with caution, taking into account both raised colony counts of single isolates and leukocyte concentration in the semen. Thus the common misdiagnosis of genital tract infection, based on the presence of seminal bacteria, and unnecessary treatment with antibiotics may be avoided.
TI  - Detection of sexually transmitted infection and human papillomavirus in negative  cytology by multiplex-PCR.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and 15 species that cause sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in negative cytology. In addition, we compared the diagnostic performance of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with widely available techniques used to detect HPV. METHODS: We recruited 235 women of reproductive age who had negative cytology findings in a liquid-based cervical smear. STIs were identified by multiplex PCR, and HPV genotypes by multiplex PCR, hybrid capture 2, and DNA microaray; discordant results were analyzed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Approximately 96.6% of patients with negative cytology results were positive for pathogens that cause STIs. The pathogens most frequently detected were Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum. The incidence of HPV in negative cytology was 23.3%. Low-risk HPV infection was significantly correlated with Chalmaydia trachomatis, and high-risk HPV infection was significantly correlated with Group beta streptococcus. The analytical sensitivities of the multiplex PCR and DNA microarray were higher than 80%, and the analytical specificity was nearly 100% for all tests. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR yielded results that most of patients with negative cytology were positive for pathogens that cause STIs, and were more similar to that of DNA microarray, than that of hybrid capture 2 in terms of analytical sensitivity and prediction value of HPV infection.
TI  - An antimicrobial investigation of plants used traditionally in southern Africa to treat sexually transmitted infections.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Eighteen plants were assessed for antimicrobial activity against pathogens associated with prevalent urogenital/sexually transmitted infections. Plant selection was based on information obtained from the ethnobotanical literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried plant material was submerged in a 1:1 mixture of methanol and dichloromethane for 24 h. Aqueous extracts were prepared by submerging dried plant material in sterile distilled water for 24 h followed by lyophilization. Essential oils were distilled from the two aromatic plant species (Tarchonanthus camphoratus and Croton gratissimus). Antimicrobial activity was assessed using the micro-well minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay with specific modifications to facilitate fastidious growth of pathogens. RESULTS: Tarchonanthus camphoratus (solvent extract) showed the most significant broad spectrum activity with MIC values ranging between 0.50 and 0.70 mg/ml against five of the six pathogens tested. Other noteworthy activity was found for Hypericum aethiopicum (root) at 0.3 mg/ml (Neisseria gonorrhoeae).Polygala fruticosa and the solvent root extract of Hypericum aethiopicum showed highest sensitivities towards Gardnerella vaginalis at 0.2 mg/ml. Efficacy of the solvent extracts against the pathogen Oligella ureolytica demonstrated antimicrobial activity (MIC values <or=1.0 mg/ml) for seven plant species. The highest activity noted against Ureaplasma urealyticum was for Psidium guajava (solvent extract) at 0.8 mg/ml. In general the aqueous extracts displayed mostly poor anti-STI activity. The most noteworthy susceptibility for the aqueous extracts was noted with the plant extract Syzygium cordatum (MIC value 0.1 mg/ml against Candida albicans). The most noteworthy activity for the essential oils was observed for Tarchonanthus camphoratus (0.8 mg/ml) against Oligella ureolytica. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial activity was observed for a number of the plant samples against at least one or more pathogen, thus validating the ethnobotanical use as an anti-infective to treat sexually transmitted diseases.
TI  - Gardnerella, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum in the genital discharge of symptomatic fertile and asymptomatic infertile women.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the different prevalence of the microorganisms investigated in the two groups considered: fertile women with symptoms and asymptomatic women with infertility problems. The data from women (n= 952) investigated for two years for quality of genital discharge and the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyiticum and Chlamydia trachomatis were retrospectively analyzed. In the population of fertile women with symptoms the microrganisms most frequently involved are Gardnerella vaginalis (26.6%), Candida species (12.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (9.2%). The genital discharges of asymptomatic women with infertility problems are characterized by a prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis (19.7%), Enterobacteriaceae or Enterococci (12.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (8.6%). The reduction of vaginal lactobacilli flora and the presence of an elevated number of polymorphonucleates in the vaginal discharge are important parameters to consider for the evaluation of the health status of the human female urogenital tract. Our results indicate that is important to culture the vaginal discharge for Streptococcus agalactiae and for prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci. Lastly, the reasons for the prevalence of some microorganisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci, Streptococcus agalactiae) in the population of infertile asymptomatic women need to be better analyzed especially after the recent studies correlating idiopathic infertility with the presence of cervical cytokines in women with an abnormal vaginal flora.
TI  - [Evaluation of microbiological diagnostics in urogenital infections in postmenopausal women].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the percentage of infections in postmenopausal women with urinary symptoms which can be confirmed by microbiological analysis, the most common causative agents and whether the urethra and vagina in patients with cystitis are concurrently colonized by pathogenic microorganisms. METHODS: Laboratories of the Croatian National Institute of Public Health in Zagreb, in the period of two years, analyzed 245 samples taken from patients with urinary symptoms who had been postmenopausal at least for a year. Urine samples, as well as urethral and vaginal swabs were taken from each patient and tested for causative agents of urogenital infections, genital mycoplasma and Chlamydia trachomatis. RESULTS: Cystitis was confirmed by microbiological analysis in 31.4% women, urethritis in 24.8%, and vaginitis in 15.1%. The most common causative agent of urethritis was Ureaplasma urealyticum, while Gardnerella vaginalis was the most common in vaginal infections. E. coli was concurrently isolated in urine, urethral and vaginal samples in 65.1% of patients with E. coli cystitis, while Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated in urethral and vaginal samples in each patient with Streptococcus agalactiae cystitis. CONCLUSION: Mucosal colonization of the urethra and vagina contributes to the incidence of cystitis in postmenopausal women. Microbiological diagnostics is necessary to distinguish between the symptoms of ageing of the urogenital system and infection, with a view to preventing unnecessary antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Vaginal ectopia of urethra as a cause of chronic recurrent cystitis in women: diagnosis and treatment].
AB  - Ectopia of the urethral opening (female hypospadia) often causes chronic recurrent cystitis in women because of a retrograde delivery of urogenital infection from the introitus and vagina to the short wide urethra and urinary bladder. Etiologically, cystitis develops due to pathogenic vaginal microflora: Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma, urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida, E. coli and other gram-negative bacteria. In 64 female patients aged 16-57 years with female hypospadia (FH) the diagnosis was made by O'Donnel-Hirchhorn symptom. Identification of urinary and vaginal microflora was made using polymerase chain reaction. Radical treatment of chronic recurrent cystitis in FH is surgical transposition of the distal urethra and its opening in the typical place with pre- and perioperative anti-inflammatory therapy according to the pathogen or with drugs having combined antimycotic and antiprotosoic properties. One of such drugs safocid demonstrates a rapid therapeutic effect in mixed urogenital infections causing chronic recurrent cystitis in women.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely Trichomonas vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma parvum, U. urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and HSV2, N. meningitidis, Mycoplasma hominis, M. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. The method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. The limits of detection for the mPCR/RLB assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic DNA. There were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. This method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with and without urethritis attending two Sydney sexual health clinics. One or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. Of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mPCR/RLB and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific PCR), 9 were positive only by mPCR/RLB, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. The mPCR/RLB method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.
TI  - Does progesterone inhibit bacteria-stimulated interleukin-8 production by lower genital tract epithelial cells?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Progesterone (P(4)) has been clinically shown to prevent the recurrence of preterm birth. The mechanism(s) of action is unclear, but may involve modulation of the immunologic inflammatory response of the lower genital tract. We evaluated the effects of P(4) on interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by vaginal and cervical epithelial cells stimulated with bacterial species that are commonly associated with preterm birth. METHODS: Vaginal and endocervical epithelial cells were incubated with up to 10,000 ng/mL P(4) overnight and stimulated with heat-killed Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, or Ureaplasma urealyticum. Concentrations of IL-8 in conditioned medium were quantified by ELISA and viability of the cell cultures was measured by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt. RESULTS: E. coli, G. vaginalis and U. urealyticum-stimulated IL-8 production for both cell lines. P(4) inhibited basal and bacteria-stimulated IL-8 production for vaginal epithelial cells but enhanced IL-8 production by endocervical cells. P(4) reduced the number of viable cells for both cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: P(4) inhibits IL-8 production by vaginal epithelial cells stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth, possibly by reducing the number of viable cells or by inhibiting their proliferation. Although P(4) also reduces proliferation of endocervical cells it also increases their production of IL-8.
TI  - Molecular quantification of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. METHODS: Molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by Gram stain-based Nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for BV; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. A quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 BV-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. The targeted microorganisms were Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus species, Mobiluncus curtisii, Mobiluncus mulieris, and Candida albicans (which can be identified by Gram staining), as well as Atopobium vaginae, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by Gram staining). RESULTS: With use of the Nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as BV, and 44 were classified as intermediate. Except for U. urealyticum, M. mulieris, and Lactobacillus species, DNA of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating BV, but the predictive value of such detection was low. The molecular quantification of A. vaginae (DNA level, > or = 10(8) copies/mL) and G. vaginalis (DNA level, > or = 10(9) copies/mL) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of BV, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a BV profile. When applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of BV.
TI  - Placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in Latvia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. METHODS: In a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (GDS) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). At delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta was studied. RESULTS: Some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had RTI or endogenous vaginal flora. Placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract colonisation with G. vaginalis (p =0.013), BV (p =0.031), S. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). BV and BV-related G. vaginalis correlated with the presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. Genital tract colonisation with GDS and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. Mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other RTIs (p =0.023). CONCLUSION: Histological placental inflammation is associated with both BV and genital tract colonisation with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.
TI  - Epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases in Rio Cuarto, Argentina.
AB  - Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are a group of transmittable diseases acquired fundamentally through sexual contact. STD are a social problem resulting from demographic explosion and changes in sexual conduct, which affects teenagers and adults of all socioeconomic strata. The goal of this work was to establish the actual state of the different STD within the studied population. Samples of vaginal fluids, endocervical materials and urethral exudates taken from 2,630 patients during five years were processed. 1,341 samples tested positive to one or more of the microorganisms, 1,099 corresponding to female patients and 242 to male patients. The microorganisms found in women were: Gardnerella vaginalis (39.1%), Candida albicans (21.3%), Trichomonas vaginalis (16.8%), Chlamydia trachomatis (11.5%); Neisseria gonorrhoeae (3.4%), Mycoplasma hominis (2.6%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (4.1%) and Treponema pallidum (1.6%). Associations were: Gardnerella vaginalis with Trichomonas vaginalis (6%), Gardnerella vaginalis with Candida albicans (5.1%); Trichomonas vaginalis with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2.2%) and Gardnerella vaginalis with Chlamydia trachomatis (2.1%). In men, gonococcic urethritis represented 37.8%, non-gonococcic urethritis 55.4% and Treponema pallidum 6.8%. A decrease in syphilis, gonococcic urethritis and gonococcic cervicitis was observed, increasing the prevalence of non-gonococcic urethritis and cervicitis. This study showed that in our environment the actual tendency of STD is still high.
TI  - [Vaginosis in patients with antenatal foetus death].
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of bacterial vaginosis as well as of vaginal anaerobe flora (Mycoplasma Hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus curtisii) was performed in women with antenatal foetus death. Specimens from forty women with this pathology were studied. Control group consisted of 100 pregnant women of the adequate age groups and gestation periods, but with live foetus. Vaginal smears treated by the use of polymerase chain reaction method showed that in the cases of antenatal foetus death in 70% of women Lactobacillus spp. was completely absent. This bacterium was observed only in 30% of these women. In 75% of women with live foetus Lactobacillus spp. was observed, while in 25% it was not present. Increase of quantity of anaerobic vaginal flora was observed in women, where the antenatal death of foetus was diagnosed. Percentage significance of these indices in women with live foetus was comparatively lower.
TI  - Preterm birth due to maternal infection: Causative pathogens and modes of prevention.
AB  - Preterm birth represents a major problem for modern obstetrics due to its increasing frequency and the accompanying socioeconomic impact. Although several maternal characteristics related to preterm birth have been identified, the etiology in most cases remains inadequately understood. Various microorganisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of preterm birth. Microbes may reach the amniotic cavity and fetus by ascending from the vagina and cervix, by hematogenous distribution through the placenta, by migration from the abdominal cavity through the fallopian tubes, or through invasive medical procedures. Organisms commonly cultured from the amniotic cavity following preterm delivery include Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Bacteroides spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and group B hemolytic streptococci. Several trials have examined the effect of antibiotic administration to patients with preterm labor and intact membranes, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, genital mycoplasmal infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and bacterial vaginosis. The results of such studies, which were variable and often conflicting, are discussed here.
TI  - Etiologies of nongonococcal urethritis: bacteria, viruses, and the association with orogenital exposure.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to determine pathogens and behaviors associated with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and the usefulness of the urethral smear in predicting the presence of pathogens. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of men with and without symptoms of NGU. Sexual practices were measured by questionnaire. First-stream urine was tested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma parvum, U. urealyticum, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, HSV-2, adenoviruses, and Gardnerella vaginalis by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: C. trachomatis (20%), M. genitalium (9%), adenoviruses (4%), and HSV-1 (2%) were more common in cases with NGU (n = 329) after age and sexual risk were adjusted for (P< or =.01); U. urealyticum, U. parvum, and G. vaginalis were not. Infection with adenoviruses or HSV-1 was associated with distinct clinical features, oral sex, and male partners, whereas infection with M. genitalium or C. trachomatis was associated with unprotected vaginal sex. Oral sex was associated with NGU in which no pathogen was detected (P < or = .001). Fewer than 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) per high-power field (HPF) on urethral smear were present in 32%, 37%, 38%, and 44% of cases with C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, adenoviruses, and HSV, respectively. CONCLUSION: We identified adenoviruses and HSV-1 as significant causes of NGU with distinct clinical and behavioral characteristics and highlighted the association between insertive oral sex and NGU. A urethral PMNL count of > or =5 PMNLs/HPF is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude pathogens in men with urethral symptoms.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  - The physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. This prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. Semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) and/or U. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) CCU ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. In standard aerobic cultures, Gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and Streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). Ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered, high (> or =10(4) CCU ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) CCU ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. Of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. This study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of U. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for U. urealyticum should be raised to > or =10(4) CFU ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before any treatment.
TI  - [Significance of clue cells in the diagnosis of male urogenital infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the significance of clue cells in the diagnosis of male urogenital infection. METHODS: Urethra swabs or prostatic fluid of 264 male outpatients were collected and smeared directly on the slice to find clue cells under the ultramicroscopy. Meanwhile, the positive patients' spouses were detected for bacterial vaginosis (BV). RESULTS: The positive rates of the urethra swabs and the prostatic fluid were 5.1% (11/215 ) and 2.0% (1/49), respectively. Nine cases in 11 of the patients' spouses (81.8%) were diagnosed as BV. CONCLUSION: BV pathogen can attack and attach to the epithelia of male genitals to form clue cells. Clue cells positive, along with clinical symptoms, contribute to the diagnosis of male urogenital bacterial infection.
TI  - A cluster analysis of bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora and pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Controversy surrounds the association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Women (N = 1,140) were ascertained at five US centers, enrolled (1999-2001), and followed up for a median of 3 years. Serial vaginal swabs were obtained for Gram's stain and cultures. PID was defined as 1) histologic endometritis or 2) pelvic pain and tenderness plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees C, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. Exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. The first correlated with BV by Gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to a lesser degree, Ureaplasma urealyticum. The second, unrelated to BV by Gram's stain, consisted of Enterococcus species and Escherichia coli. Being in the highest tertile in terms of growth of BV-associated microorganisms increased PID risk (adjusted rate ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 3.53). Carriage of non-BV-associated microorganisms did not increase PID risk. Women with heavy growth of BV-associated microorganisms and a new sexual partner appeared to be at particularly high risk (adjusted rate ratio = 8.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 69.2). When identified by microbial culture, a combination of BV-related microorganisms significantly elevated the risk of acquiring PID.
TI  - Symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis in heterosexual men: a case control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine microbial and behavioural factors contributing to non-gonococcal urethral symptoms in men. METHODS: Case-control study of heterosexual men with non-gonococcal urethral symptoms (cases) and without urethral symptoms (controls) attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, Australia. Sexual behaviour and condom use were measured by questionnaire. First stream urine was tested for potential pathogens: Chlamydia trachomatis (ligase chain reaction), Mycoplasma genitalium (polymerase chain reaction, PCR), Ureaplasma urealyticum (culture and PCR), and Streptococcus spp, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Haemophilus species (culture). Urethral smears from cases were examined for polymorphonuclear leucocytes. RESULTS: 80 cases and 79 controls were recruited over 4 months in 2002-3. 49 cases (61%) had urethritis by microscopic criteria, 17 (21%) had Chlamydia trachomatis (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 27 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.4 to 222)), five (6%) had Mycoplasma genitalium (OR 6.1 (95% CI: 0.6 to 61)), and 11 (14%) had Gardnerella vaginalis (OR 9.0 (95% CI: 1.6 to 52)). Other organisms were not significantly associated with urethral symptoms. The presence of urethritis on urethral smear did not predict the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis (OR 1.7 (95% CI: 0.5 to 5.4)). Urethral symptoms were significantly associated with unprotected vaginal sex with more than one casual partner (OR 9.3 (95% CI: 1.3 to 65)) and unprotected anal sex with a regular partner in the past month (OR 3.5 (95% CI: 1.0 to 13)). CONCLUSION: Gardnerella vaginalis and unprotected anal sex may cause symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis. Microscopy of the urethral smear to diagnose urethritis in this population does not help to identify which men with urethral symptoms require treatment for chlamydia.
TI  - [Studies on the infection status of seven species Mycoplasma, three species of Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Garderella vaginalis in 76 patients with sexual transmitted diseases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious status of seven species of Mycoplasma, three species of Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Garderella vaginalis in the 76 male sexual transmitted disease (STD) patients in Yangzhou city. METHODS: Twelve species of pathogens including Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu), Mycoplasma hominis (Mh), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpn), Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg), Mycoplasma fermentans (Mf), Mycoplasma penetrans (Mpe), Mycoplasma prium (Mpi), Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), Chlamydia psittaci (Cps), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) and Garderella vaginalis (GV) were detected by nested polymerase chain reaction including PPNG. RESULTS: The positive rates of Uu, Mh, Mpn, Mg, Mf, Mpe, Ct, Ng were 64.5%, 27.6%, 26.3%, 18.4%, 2.6%, 2.6%, 31.6%, 36.8%, in which Penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) accounted for 14.3%, GV 15.8%. No Mpi, Cpn or Cps were found. There was more significant therapeutic effects on the detectable rate of Mycoplasma nucleic acid between positive gonococcus and negative gonococcus in male STDs patients (chi(2) = 3.848, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The infection rates of Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Ng and GV were high among male STD patients in Yangzhou city. In clinical practice, more attention should be paid on correct diagnosis and treatment for patients, with Gonococcus, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and GV.
TI  - [Abnormal bacterial colonisation of the vagina and implantation during assisted reproduction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of our treatment of vaginal infection for couples included in an IVF program. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Microbiologic screening of vaginal flora and semen has been performed one month prior to in vitro fertilization for 951 couples in 2000. Antibiotic treatment was prescribed in case of positive culture. RESULTS: Positive microbial growths were observed from endocervical and vaginal cultures in 218 women (22.9%). The clinical pregnancy rate was 30.29% in the group of patients without growth and 30.27% in the group with positive microbial growth. The implantation rate was significantly diminished in case of bacterial growth: 14.6 compared to 19.3% (P <0.02) for sterile endocervical culture. Five main bacterial species were found at the cervical level: Candida albicans (69 cases), Ureaplasma urealyticum (49 cases), Gardnerella vaginalis (43 cases), Streptococcus B or D (24 cases) and Escherichia coli (22 cases). Positive cultures from both vagina and semen were observed for 77 couples whose clinical pregnancy rate was 19.5 vs 36.2% in case of vaginal infection alone (P <0.01) with a spontaneous miscarriage rate of 46.7 compared to 17.6% (P <0.01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Endocervical microorganisms, even treated with adapted antibiotics, may affect embryonic implantation. Positive culture from both female and male partner may enhance this negative effect. In this case, the best strategy would be to cancel the IVF treatment.
TI  - [Prevalence of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections among high-risk patients attending a free anonymous HIV-screening center].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among patients attending an anonymous HIV Screening Center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was performed in the HIV Screening Center of University hospital in Reims (France) from May 1997 to December 1997. The inclusion criteria were the asymptomatic clinical presentation and the presence of risk factors for sexually transmitted infections referring to WHO criteria. The methods included clinical examination after application of acetic acid and urethral and endocervical swabs to identify:Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis in specific culture. Treponema pallidum and HIV-1 infection were both detected by Enzym Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). RESULTS: One hundred and one patients (62 men and 39 women) were included in the study. Their mean age was 27 +/- 4 Years. Risk factors for sexually transmitted infections were: multiple sexual partners 81 p. 100; homo or bisexuality 16 p. 100; intravenous drug use 3 p. 100. The sexually transmitted infections were: HIV-1 infection 1 p. 100;Ureaplasma urealyticum 25 p. 100; genital warts 5 p. 100;Chlamydia trachomatis 3 p. 100; Gardnerella vaginalis 3 p. 100; Mycoplasma hominis 2 p. 100; Treponema pallidum 0 p. 100; Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0 p. 100; Trichomonas vaginalis 0 p. 100. The prevalence of sexually transmitted infections was significantly higher among women (p<0.05). DISCUSSION: Classical sexually transmitted infections and HIV infection were rarely detected in this study; but prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (genital warts, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum) was high. Ureaplasma urealyticum is considered as a possible pathogenic agent in pregnant women (preterm delivery, decrease of birth weight, chorioamniotitis). These results suggest that other than sexually transmitted infections in high risk patients attending a HIV Screening Center other sexually transmitted infections should also be systematically screened for.
TI  - Cervical immunoglobulin A and altered vaginal flora in pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery.
AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin A concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. The results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. Concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. There was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). The median of cervical IgA levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical IgA concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. Patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest IgA levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). Measurement of cervical IgA concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.
TI  - [Role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. The participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of UTI; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. To gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in UTI. METHODS: A total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low UTI were analyzed. Samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and McConkey agar, as well as HBT medium for G. vaginalis, and U9B broth and agar E broth for M. hominis and U. urealyticum. The following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. RESULTS. There were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. Escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): G. vaginalis (25.7%), U. urealyticum (5.9%), S. agalactiae (3.4%) and M. hominis (2%). UTI were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and in diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of UTI.
TI  - [Allelic polymorphism of the tem(M) determinant in Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum clinical isolates resistant to tetracyclines].
AB  - Of the 130 clinical isolates of Mycoplasma hominis from patients with nonspecific inflammatory diseases of the urogenital tract (UGT), approximately 10% contained the tet(M) gene after the course of treatment with tetracyclines. This gene was found in nine (25%) of the 36 Ureaplasma urealyticum clinical isolates. The nucleotide sequence of 13 tet(M) genes in TcR clinical isolates of M. hominis and five genes in U. urealyticum TcR clinical isolates was determined. A comparison of nucleotide sequences of eight tetM genes of different origin and tet(M) genes of Gardnerella vaginalis and M. hominis and U. urealyticum clinical isolates showed that the mosaic structure of the tet(M) gene is completely identical in 11 of 13 M. hominis TcR isolates but belongs to an unidentified allele different from those described earlier, Another new allelic variant of tet(M) was found in two isolates. In three of five TcR clinical isolates of U. urealyticum, a tet(M) gene, whose mosaic structure was identical to that of tet(M) reported previously for ureaplasmas, and also two new allelic variants, which have not been described so far, were found.
TI  - [Cervicovaginal infection as a risk factor for premature labor].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the possible association between cervicovaginal infections (CVI) and preterm delivery. DESIGN: Cohorts. REFERENCE FRAME: Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, Hospital Central Militar and Hospital General Regional No. 1, IMSS, Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. PATIENTS: Four hundred and sixty eight patients attending prenatal control and delivery care. INTERVENTIONS: Fresh smears, Gram stain, and cervicovaginal sample culture from samples obtained during the following gestational stages: First sample at 16-24 weeks, second sample at 25-32 weeks, and third sample at 33-42 weeks. The following microorganisms were studied: Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis. In case of a positive culture, the specific treatment was indicated. MEASUREMENTS: Positive or negative culture for each of the studied pathogens, and the presence or absence of a preterm delivery for each of the patients included in the study. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety eight were still present at the end of the study, of which 156 had a CVI and 242 had no CVI. No differences between both groups were observed concerning preterm delivery. Significant relative risks were: In the first stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis with RR = 9.0 (6.81, 11.8); in the second stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 6.2 (3.30, 11.7) and Escherichia coli with RR = 3.4 (1.33, 8.6); in the third stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 9.19 (6.93, 12.1). The logistic regression analysis identified Ureaplasma urealyticum during the second stage with OR = 16.6 (2.9, 93.7), statistically significant with p = 0.001. The survival analysis showed differences between the two groups concerning pregnancy duration (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a difference in the duration in pregnancy in patients with CVI and without CVI. Ureaplasma urealyticum is consistently associated with preterm delivery.
TI  - Characterization of vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis in women who have sex with women.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) may be common among women who report having sex with women (WSW) and frequently occurs in both members of monogamous couples. The results of Gram staining of a vaginal smear were consistent with BV in 81 (25%) and intermediate in 37 (11%) of 326 WSW included in this study. Lactobacilli were detected in 64% of subjects, and 42% of subjects had H(2)O(2)-producing strains. BV was associated with a higher lifetime number of female sex partners, failure to always clean an insertive sex toy before use, and oral-anal sex with female partners. Neither recent douching nor sexual practices with male partners were associated with BV. Vaginal smears from each partner were concordant in 55 (95%) of 58 monogamous couples; BV was present in both partners in 16 couples (28%) (P<.001, compared with expected distribution). BV was common among subjects who did not douche, who did not have concurrent sex with male partners, or who did not have a new sex partner, which suggests that other risk factors for BV exist. These data support the hypothesis that sexual exchange of vaginal secretions is a possible mechanism for acquisition of BV.
TI  - [Complications of sexually transmitted diseases: clinical course and treatment].
AB  - Sexually transmitted infectious agents cause a wide array of complications in the short-, medium-, and long-term, especially among women. Specifically, infection with these agents can result in sterility, infertility, genital neoplasia, pre-term delivery, and foetal/neonatal pathologies, and the agents most commonly associated with these complications are: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, anaerobic bacteria, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis and human papilloma virus (HPV), which is involved in the etiology of squamous genital carcinomas. This report describes several of the mechanisms involved in the damage to genital and reproductive organs, focussing on those mechanisms involved in the damage caused by delayed autoimmune response.
TI  - Predictors of the vaginal microflora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to define influences on the patterns of the vaginal microflora. STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 617 African American and Mexican American women in a 1-year longitudinal study of sexual behaviors and the vaginal microflora on the basis of the presence of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, or syphilis at the initial visit. The patients were assigned randomly to a behavioral intervention or standard counseling regarding sexually transmitted disease. We reevaluated 508 (82%) and 549 (89%) women at 6 and 12 months, respectively. A comprehensive survey of lower genital tract organisms was conducted at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Behavioral and microbiologic associations were screened by bivariate analysis. All variables associated with an organism at P < or = .15 were included in a multivariate analysis. Associations between behavior and the genital tract microflora were identified by logistic regression coefficients with P <.05. RESULTS: African American race had a consistent association with vaginal microflora, specifically, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, group B streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Various behaviors had a less consistent effect, including multiple partners, douching, frequency of coitus >3 times a week, and cunnilingus, fellatio, and anal intercourse at the last sexual encounter. M hominis (but not Ureaplasma urealyticum ), Gardnerella vaginalis, and Lactobacillus species were associated with bacterial vaginosis. Lactobacillus species appeared to protect against bacterial vaginosis and infection with G vaginalis. Sexually transmitted diseases (caused by M hominis, N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and T vaginalis ) were associated with each other. In contrast, hormonal status, vaginal blood, and foreign bodies had little effect. CONCLUSION: The presence of other microorganisms and race have a more consistent association with the presence or absence of a cervical-vaginal organism than sexual behavior, hormonal status, vaginal devices, or the presence of abnormal vaginal bleeding.
TI  - Detection of cervical immunoglobulin A in normal pregnancy.
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. In 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. In this cervical mucus immunoglobulin A concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. A vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each woman. Concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. There was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55 (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin A concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). The serum levels of immunoglobulins A, A1, A2, M and G do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin A levels nor to gestational age. In normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin A concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin A levels.
TI  - Role of the male partner in the lower genitourinary tract infection of female.
AB  - We studied the relationships of selected microbes and the role of consorts in the causation of vaginal discharge which may be due to cervicitis or vaginitis. A total of 93 consecutive patients in the reproductive age group with symptoms of vaginal discharge along with their sexual partners were studied. Samples were collected from the cervix and posterior fornix of the female patients and from the urethra and sub-prepucial area of the male partner for culture of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma, candida, aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Apart from cultures, KOH and Gram stain of the discharge were made. Predominant pathogen isolated was Ureaplasma urealyticum from 40 (43.01%) females and 23 (24.7%) males. The next common pathogenic organisms isolated were candida species from 11 (11.8%) females and 5 (5.4%) males and Chlamydia trachomatis in 3 (3.2%) females and 1 (1.1%) male. Various organisms were more frequently isolated from the 29 of 43 (67.4%) couples who had had sexual intercourse 7 days prior to the recruitment as compared to 14 of 43 (32.6%) who had had coitus more than 7 days prior to their recruitment. This may be due to the spontaneous disappearance or decrease in the number of organisms to the level that they could be detected by culture. In our study, 6 (6.5%) of male partners carrying pathogenic organisms were asymptomatic, indicating that their screening and treatment is vital.
TI  - Association of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum with some indicators of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the isolation rates of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum from three populations of women and also to relate the presence of these microorganisms with some indicators of nonspecific vaginitis. Three hundred vaginal swabs were taken from delivery, pregnant and control (not pregnant) women. Cultures were done in E broth supplemented with arginine or urea. M. hominis was isolated in 5% at delivery, 12% from pregnant and 5% from control women and U. urealyticum was isolated in 21%, 31% and 28% respectively. There was statistical difference in the isolation rate of M. hominis in pregnant women respect to the other groups. Both microorganisms were more frequently isolated in women with acid vaginal pH, amine-like odor in KOH test, clue cells and leucorrhea. M. hominis was isolated in 17% and U. urealyticum in 52% from women with nonspecific vaginitis. M. hominis was isolated in 2% and U. urealyticum in 13% from women without nonspecific vaginitis. Although the presence of clue cells and amine-like odor in KOH test have relationship with Gardnerella vaginalis, these tests could also suggest the presence of these mycoplasmas.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was first reported in 1995 by Gardner and Dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. They also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "Haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. BV has a complex microbiology. Lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes G. vaginalis, anaerobic Gram-negative rods such as Prevotella species, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. Those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome, raising the vaginal pH and producing a discharge odor. The excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". Nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. Results from epidemiologic studies have associated BV with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. In particular, the presence of BV in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that BV is a cause of preterm delivery. The interest in potential invasiveness of G. vaginalis has increased. However, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. The most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.
TI  - Symptomatic bacteriuria due to Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma in adults.
AB  - 314 women, and 52 men were screened during 18 months, for the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in a midstream specimens of urine. All the patients were adults with symptoms of urinary tract infection who consulted a physician at a Primary Health Center "Jose Castro Villagrana" in Tlalpan, D.F. Mexico. Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated in 54 (17.1%) of the women and 8 (15.4%) of the men. Only Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis were isolated more frequently in both groups, 36.6% and 25.4%, respectively in women and 58.5% and 30.8% in men Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in 12 (3.8%) in women and 4 (7.7%) in men. The bacteriuria due to fastidious bacteria or Ureaplasmas that is not detected by routine culture methods are relatively common and would not necessarily respond to antibiotic treatment for conventional urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - Role of bacterial typing in genitourinary medicine.
AB  
TI  - Association of indicators of bacterial vaginosis with a female genital tract factor that induces expression of HIV-1.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of bacterial vaginosis and bacterial vaginosis-associated microorganisms with an HIV-inducing factor (HIF) found in cervicovaginal lavage. DESIGN: A total of 26 cervicovaginal lavage specimens collected from 17 women were used in this study to determine if HIF was significantly associated with features consistent with bacterial vaginosis. METHODS: Patients were evaluated for various clinical features including age, HIV status and stage, CD4 cell counts, clinical diagnosis of gynecological infections, vaginal pH, Gram stains of vaginal fluid, phase of menstruation, and presence of cervical dysplasia. Cervicovaginal lavage specimens were analyzed for the presence of HIF by U1 bioassay. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, and general Mycoplasmataceae, and specifically Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, M. fermentans, M. genitalium in cervicovaginal lavage were determined by semiquantitative PCR. RESULTS: Eleven cervicovaginal lavage samples from seven women were HIF-positive and 15 cervicovaginal lavage samples from 11 women were HIF-negative (patient No. 8 had two HIF-negative cervicovaginal lavage and one HIF-positive cervicovaginal lavage). The following parameters were significantly associated with HIF: abnormal vaginal fluid pH (>4.5) (P = 0.006), Gram stains indicative of bacterial vaginosis (P = 0.007), normal menstrual cycle (P = 0.0007) and PCR detection and relative quantity of M. hominis (P = 0.0003, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that HIF is closely associated with features of bacterial vaginosis.

AB  
TI  - Preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  - Opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (PTB) cases. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which Gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic species primarily among Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Mobiluncus; Mycoplasma hominis; and Ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. This BV complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, PTB, and other perinatal infectious complications. Pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. In the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. Also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely F. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. Although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to PTB.
TI  - Chlamydia trachomatis: probable cause of prostatitis.
AB  - Seventy-eight men with symptoms of chronic or subacute prostatitis were enrolled. Investigations for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis in urethral swabs were carried out. The expressed prostatic secretions were additionally examined for Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, Trichomonas vaginalis, yeast-like fungi and leucocyte count. Furthermore, all patients were evaluated for the presence of serum anti-chlamydial IgG antibodies. Signs of inflammation on the basis of the count of leucocytes per hpf in the prostatic secretions were detected in 42 patients (group I). Prostatodynia was found in the remaining 36 men (group II). In group I, chlamydial antigen was detected in the urethra and expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) in 6 (14.3%) and 9 (21.4%) patients, respectively. No evidence of current chlamydial infection was found in group II. The presence of serum anti-chlamydial IgG antibodies was demonstrated in 13/42 (30.9%) patients with prostatitis and in 3/36 (8.3%) patients with prostatodynia (P < 0.01). The results suggest that chlamydia may be one of the causative agents of chronic prostatitis.
TI  - Vaginal microflora in postmenopausal women who have not received estrogen replacement therapy.
AB  - We studied the vaginal microflora of 73 postmenopausal women who had never received estrogen replacement therapy. The median age of these women was 67 years, and none of them had bacterial vaginosis. Lactobacilli were detected in 36 (49%) of these women at a mean concentration of 10(5.7) cfu/g of vaginal fluid. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 38% of the women. Some of the other organisms that were recovered, including Gardnerella vaginalis (27% of the women), Ureaplasma urealyticum (13%), Candida albicans (1%), and Prevotella bivia (33%), were less frequently isolated from postmenopausal women than from women of reproductive age, while coliforms (41%) were recovered at higher frequencies. Lactobacilli, yeasts, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria are less commonly part of the vaginal microflora in postmenopausal women than in women of reproductive age, which may explain the decrease in the incidence of bacterial vaginosis and yeast vaginitis among these women.
TI  - Microbiology of semen specimens from males attending a fertility clinic.
AB  - The relationship between semen quality, pyospermia and bacteriology was studied in 201 semen specimens from male patients attending a fertility clinic. Semen quality parameters were within normal limits in 115 (57%) patients, slightly reduced in 60 (30%), and 26 (13%) had findings indicating reduced fertility. Twelve patients (6%) had pyospermia. In 182 patients, 552 microorganisms were detected, including Enterobacteriaceae (2.8%), Gardnerella vaginalis (9.6%), Chlamydia trachomatis (1.6%), Mycoplasma genitalium (0.9%), and Ureaplasma urealyticum (11.8%). Semen quality was neither related to occurrence of microorganisms nor pyospermia. However, pyospermia was associated with simultaneous growth of Gardnerella vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. The exact nature of this association could not be ascertained, in as far as the males were not questioned about urethritis symptoms.
TI  - What is normal vaginal flora?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the composition of the vaginal flora of healthy women over  time, and in relation to hormonal changes, sexual activity, and hygiene habits. DESIGN: A longitudinal surveillance of the vaginal flora over an eight week period. SUBJECTS: 26 female health care workers in local genitourinary medicine clinics. METHODS: The participants were anonymised. They filled in diary cards daily. Blind vaginal swabs were self-taken two-seven times weekly. A smear was air-dried for later Gram staining. The swabs were also cultured for Candida spp, Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. RESULTS: Of 26 subjects, only four had normal vaginal microbiology throughout. One woman, who was not sexually active, had bacterial vaginosis (BV) throughout and nine (35%) had intermittent BV. Candidiasis was found intermittently in eight women (31%), and eight had normal microscopy. U urealyticum was isolated intermittently in 40% of women with BV, 25% with candida, and 50% with normal microscopy. Many women were symptomatic, but symptoms correlated poorly with microbiological findings. All but two women were sexually active; however, more women with BV were exposed to semen. BV seemed to be related to frequent use of scented soap, and there appeared to be an additive effect of clothing and hygiene factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study raises doubts about what should be regarded as normal vaginal flora. It calls into question the significance of finding BV or U urealyticum on a single occasion in asymptomatic women, or of finding normal flora in symptomatic women. The effect of external factors on the vaginal flora deserve further study.
TI  - [Microbiological study of some microorganisms implicated in sexually transmitted  diseases among the female prison population].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are of over greater interest, particularly since the appearance of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) in the last decade. Asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections are very frequent, overall in women. The aim of this study was to know the prevalence of certain STD producing microorganisms in a female penitentiary population, the clinical characteristics and evaluate the risk factors which may be found in this population. METHODS: One hundred thirty-three female prisoners attended in the Gynecology Ward of the Female Penitentiary of Carabanchel of Madrid, Spain, were studied over 13 months (from 30 April 1993 to 30 May, 1994). Vaginal and endocervical samples were taken in each case for microbiologic study by the usual methods. Demographic and clinical data were collected as were possible risk factors for acquiring STD (age of first sexual relations, sexual habits, intravenous drug addiction.
TI  - [Frequency of isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum in an open population from southern Mexico City].
AB  - Vaginal cultures for Ureaplasma urealyticum and confidential questionnaires were  obtained from women with signs and symptoms of vaginitis who consulted a physician at a Primary Health Center, Tlalpan, D.F., Mexico. In all 220 women were studied, 50 (22.7%) of whom were colonized with Ureaplasma urealyticum, statistical analysis (X2) showed there was no association between colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum, and age, pregnancy, and other but there was association between colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum and the number of pregnancies and no birth control method use.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis infection in heterosexual couples. Ultrastructural study of desquamation cells of the stratified epithelium].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most frequent infections during the woman's reproductive age. Lactobacilli normal flora is substituted by relatively elevated Gardnerella vaginalis (GV), anaerobic bacteroids, Mobiluncus and Mycoplasma. The purpose of this study is to perform a morphological analysis of possible mechanisms for adhesion and penetration of GV in the heterosexual couple, in squamous epithelium at vaginal wall, as well as in seminal fluid. Ten couples with positive GV culture with three to four days of abstinence, were studied. The women presented with at least three of the four Amsel's criteria. Samples were obtained from vaginal lateral walls and from seminal fluid; these were divided in two parts: 1. To realize cultures for GV. Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis; and 2. For an ultrastructural analysis. Samples were processed with common techniques for electronic microscopy. In vaginal cells, bacteria similar to GV free form fixed to plasmatic membrane and inside the cellular cytoplasm. In the seminal fluid there were found numerous urethral cells of desquamation, which presented, as well as in woman, free form bacteria, fixed to plasmatic membrane and inside the cytoplasm. In four cases, bacteria similar to Mycoplasma, were found; and one case with particles suggesting cytomegalovirus. It is concluded in this study that: 1. The male presents with urethral cells similar to vaginal "guide cells". 2. GV colonizes urethral epithelium in the male. 3. Male is capable of infecting and/or re-infecting the woman.
TI  - Changes in vaginal flora during pregnancy and association with preterm birth.
AB  - A prospective study of the vaginal flora changes between midtrimester and labor was undertaken in 560 women; 337 had intact membranes and were in labor when swabs were taken. Of these, 45 delivered preterm. Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum (both associated with preterm birth when present in midtrimester), and Mycoplasma hominis commonly persisted between midtrimester and labor, particularly in the preterm cohort (24 [65%] of 37 midtrimester isolates), and these organisms were seldom acquired late in pregnancy. A second group, Bacteroides species, had both a high persistence (9 [60%] of 15 midtrimester isolates) and high late acquisition rate (10 [53%] of 19 labor isolates) in the preterm cohort. These findings provide a rationale for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. A third group, comprising enteropharyngeal bacteria and Peptostreptococcus species, were almost all acquired late in the preterm cohort (14 [88%] of 16 labor isolates), and persistence from midtrimester was rare.
TI  - Genital flora in pregnancy and its association with intrauterine growth retardation.
AB  - A study of risk factors for intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was conducted  among a cohort of 13,914 pregnant women enrolled in the multicenter Vaginal Infections and Prematurity Study. From 23 through 26 weeks of gestational age, cultures of specimens from the vagina and cervix were done for group B streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella. Newborns who were small for their gestational age were delivered by 1,251 women, and infants of the appropriate weight for their gestational age were delivered by 10,332 women. When controlling for ethnicity and smoking and excluding women treated with antibiotics, the Mantel-Haenszel adjusted relative risk of IUGR was 1.16 for Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.33), 1.16 for M. hominis (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.29), 1.20 for U. urealyticum (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.38), and 1.22 for T. vaginalis (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.42). There was also a strong and significant trend for an increasing risk of IUGR with the number of these four microbes recovered. Among women colonized with all four isolates, the adjusted odds ratio of IUGR was 1.79 (95% CI, 1.27 to 2.52) in comparison with women not colonized with any of these microorganisms. Group B streptococci, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and C. albicans were not significantly associated with IUGR. These results suggest that infection is associated with some cases of IUGR and that specific microorganisms, alone or in combination, are involved. Since genital isolates are highly correlated with each other, the relative contribution of each microbe is difficult to determine.
TI  - Variability of polymerase chain reaction-based detection of human papillomavirus  DNA is associated with the composition of vaginal microbial flora.
AB  - The results of repeated human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing were compared to changes in cervical pathology and the composition of vaginal microorganisms. A cohort of 19 women with HPV cervical infections in the absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at enrollment was reexamined on average at 7.3-month intervals over a 2-year period. At each follow-up visit, cytological and colposcopic examinations were done and vaginal microorganisms were assessed quantitatively by Gram staining of secretions, and anaerobic and aerobic culture. HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 were detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis using DNA isolated from exfoliated cervical cells. The detection of HPV DNA was significantly associated with carriage of Grade II flora (P < 0.001), isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis (P = 0.03), Ureaplasma urealyticum (P = 0.04), Candida albicans (P = 0.01), Bacteroides species (P = 0.01), and overgrowth by anaerobes (P = 0.004). Normal vaginal flora, characterised by the predominance of Lactobacillus species, was significantly associated (P < 0.001) with a negative HPV test. The detection of HPV DNA is associated with the composition of microorganisms present in the vagina at the time of testing.
TI  - [Perinatal infections. Infection as etiological factor of preterm labor].
AB  - On the ground of contemporary medical literature and our own observations, we have tried to estimate the participation of microorganism infection in preterm labor. In this article, we present mechanism, currently recognized as the most probable, that are leading to preterm labor under condition of perinatal infections. One of them seems to be the production of enzymes by pathological strains. Those enzymes are considered to stimulate decidual and amniotic cells to arachidonic acid metabolism and prostaglandins synthesis. Coexisted with chorionamnionitis the migration of leukocytes that are able to induce prostaglandins synthesis releasing interleukin, can also be an important factor of preterm labor.
TI  - The microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A group of microorganisms are present concurrently in high concentrations in the  vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis. The major members of the group are Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Facultative species of Lactobacillus are present in lower concentrations and are less prevalent in bacterial vaginosis than in women with a normal vaginal examination. The exact microbe(s) responsible for bacterial vaginosis is unknown whether among the organisms listed above or an unknown agent. The high concentrations of anaerobic gram-negative rods, peptostreptococci, and other opportunistic pathogens in the lower genital tract place women with bacterial vaginosis at increased risk for genital infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - The normal vaginal flora, H2O2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  - In this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (Lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the basis of a vaginal smear. BV was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with BV, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and 61% of those with a normal flora. H2O2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. The microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with BV included Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia/disiens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Prevotella corporis/Bacteroides levii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mobiluncus species, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus tetradius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis (P < .05 for each). The presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by H2O2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were B. ureolyticus, F. nucleatum, and P. prevotii. Other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without BV. We conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with BV in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with BV and those inhibited by H2O2-producing lactobacilli.
TI  - Prevalence of cervical pathogens in women with and without inflammatory changes on smear testing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess correlation between nonspecific cervicitis, inflammation, or exudate on cervical smears tests and confirmed presence of known cervical pathogens. DESIGN: Investigation of women attending a family practice clinic for smear test by microbiological screening for Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, group B streptococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. SETTING: Family practice teaching clinic in a university hospital. PATIENTS: 411 women presenting for a smear test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of genital infections associated with presence or absence of inflammatory changes on cervical smear. RESULTS: Of the 132 women with inflammatory changes on cervical smear, 64 (48%) had positive cultures. Of the 248 without inflammatory changes, 117 (47%) had positive cultures. Subgroup analysis on individual organisms also showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Reports of inflammatory changes on cervical smear testing are a poor indicator of infection.
TI  - Tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 2 in normal and infected human seminal fluid.
AB  - The presence of cytokines such as the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin 2 (IL2) in human spermatozoa is still to be defined. The aim of this study was to measure the concentration of both soluble factors in seminal fluid. Data from normal semen samples (n = 24) confirmed the presence of IL2 (258 +/- 84 fmol/ml corresponding to 953 +/- 369 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) and TNF alpha (62.2 +/- 16.4 fmol/ml corresponding to 231.3 +/- 86 fmol/total volume of ejaculate). A significant positive correlation (r = 0.59; P < 0.01) was observed between the TNF alpha and the IL2 concentrations. The concentrations of these cytokines were not related to sperm parameters. In contrast, IL2 concentrations (196.9 +/- 60.4 fmol/ml; 686.2 +/- 236.7 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) evaluated in 16 seminal fluids with identified bacterial agents were lower than in the control group, whereas TNF alpha concentrations (68.6 +/- 12.3 fmol/ml; 241.3 +/- 78.9 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) were not significantly different from the controls. Further studies are needed to determine the potential role of these cytokines in the physiology of semen and their usefulness as indicators of reproductive pathology.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  - Rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. High concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. Like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), Streptococcus spp. (MIC50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC50, 0.06 microgram/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 0.25 microgram/ml). Rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting Bacteroides bivius-disiens, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., and Mobiluncus spp. strains (all MICs < or = 1 microgram/ml). Strains of Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. However, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were rifaximin resistant, for example, Candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to rifamycin resistance.
TI  - [Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in a group of adolescents attending a perinatal care institute].
AB  - To start an active sexual activity at an earlier age and with a larger number of  partners, has arousen the frequency of sexually transmitted diseases (STS). The teenagers are a group particularly affected. The objective of this article is to report the etiology of STD in a group of teenagers, out-patients at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia (INPer). The study includes 1360 patients at the clinic of STD at the INPer, 8.5 percent were less than 20 years old; 18.9 percent of them had previously a STD. The most frequent pathology was cervicovaginitis and the most frequently isolated pathogens were Candida sp, Gardnerella vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. There were no cases of gonorrhea. Three patients had Immunodeficiency Syndrome.
TI  - Infection and labor. VIII. Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in patients  with suspected cervical incompetence: prevalence and clinical significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in patients presenting with cervical dilatation in the midtrimester of pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Amniocentesis for microbial studies was performed in women admitted with cervical dilatation > or = 2 cm, intact membranes, and without active labor between 14 and 24 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluid was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as for mycoplasmas. Gram stain was performed on all samples. RESULTS: The prevalence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity was 51.5% (17/33). The most common microbial isolates were Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans, and Fusobacterium sp. All patients with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity had complications. Patients who underwent cervical cerclage in the presence of a positive amniotic fluid culture had rupture of membranes, clinical chorioamnionitis, or pregnancy loss. On the other hand, the prognosis of patients with a negative amniotic fluid culture was better than that of patients with a positive culture. Of 16 patients with a negative amniotic culture, nine were delivered at > 34 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity occurs frequently in women presenting with cervical dilatation in the midtrimester; (2) the microbiologic state of the amniotic cavity is an important prognostic factor for pregnancy outcome; (3) amniocentesis to determine the microbiologic characteristics of the amniotic cavity should be considered before a cerclage is placed in women presenting with cervical dilatation in the midtrimester.
TI  - Prenatal microbiological risk factors associated with preterm birth.
AB  
TI  - [Epidemiological factors and vaginal flora changes in vaginal bacteriosis (bacterial vaginosis)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to know the modifications of the vaginal bacterial flora that occurs in bacterial vaginosis and to know the involvement of these microorganisms and the influence of several epidemiologic factors in the etiology of this disease. METHODS: We studied, by using semiquantitative cultures and GLC, vaginal washings from 50 healthy women and 50 women with bacterial vaginosis. RESULTS: The most remarkable results were the high sensitivity of Amsel's criteria and their good correlation with GLC. Women with bacterial vaginosis showed a great increase of CFUs/ml of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and several species of anaerobic bacteria, and an important decrease of the amounts of aerobic lactobacilli. The main epidemiologic factor among those that were studied was the use of IUDs. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of bacterial vaginosis is associated with the increase of the amounts of G. vaginalis, Bacteroides or related genera (Prevotella, Porphyromonas), and probably M. hominis and U. urealyticum, also being associated to a decrease of the amounts of aerobic lactobacilli. These facts are probably related with alteration in the ecologic relationship lactobacilli/G. vaginalis/anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - The relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  - Lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. The role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. Vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of H2O2-positive and H2O2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. Compared with women with H2O2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized by H2O2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and viridans streptococci (P less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). In addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with H2O2-positive lactobacilli to have Chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by Enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (P less than .05 for each comparison). Vaginal colonization by group B streptococci or Escherichia coli was not related to the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli. These data suggest that the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.
TI  - Prenatal microbiological risk factors associated with preterm birth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the vaginal flora of pregnant women at 22-28 weeks gestation  to determine whether the presence of specific micro-organisms is significantly associated with preterm birth and prelabour rupture of the membranes. DESIGN: A comprehensive descriptive prospective study of the vaginal micro-flora of women between 22-28 weeks gestation comparing those who gave birth preterm (less than 37 weeks) with those who gave birth at term. Microbiological assessment included cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, genital mycoplasmas and Trichomonas vaginalis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to account for confounding obstetric and demographic variables. SETTING: The Queen Victoria Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia. SUBJECTS: 135 women who gave birth preterm compared to 651 women who gave birth at term. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Preterm birth and preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) RESULTS: The prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis between 22-28 weeks was significantly higher in women who gave birth preterm compared to women who gave birth at term (23% vs 15%; multiple logistic regression odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.01-3.2, P less than 0.05. Ureaplasma urealyticum was also found in a higher proportion of women who gave birth preterm (49% vs 32% OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6, P less than 0.0005). Preterm PROM occurred in 42% of whom 60% were carriers of U. urealyticum between 22-28 weeks, compared with 32% in the term group (OR 3.2, CI 1.7-6.1, P less than 0.0005). When women who received antibiotics between the midtrimester swab and labour were excluded, G. vaginalis was also significantly associated with preterm PROM (OR 2.7, CI 1.1-6.5, P less than 0.05). The presence of vaginal enteropharyngeal bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus spp., Staph. aureus) in the midtrimester was not predictive of preterm birth, but when these organisms were found in labour, they appeared to have been acquired later in the pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Women carrying G. vaginalis or U. urealyticum during the midtrimester had nearly twice the risk of preterm birth, while women positive for U. urealyticum had more than a threefold risk of preterm PROM.
TI  - A microbiological study of vaginal discharge in women attending a Malaysian gynaecological clinic.
AB  - Vaginal discharge is a common complaint of women attending gynaecological clinics. The purpose of this study was to compare the occurrence of commonly implicated microorganisms in vaginal discharge amongst women with or without the complaint, attending a gynaecological and family planning clinic. The association of Gardnerella vaginalis with bacterial vaginosis was also studied. It was found that there were no significant differences between the cases and controls in the isolation rate of Gardnerella vaginalis, Torulopsis glabrata, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma ssp and Group B streptococcus (p greater than 0.05). Only the isolation rate of Candida albicans was significantly higher in the cases than controls (p less than 0.01). However, there was a significant association of G. vaginalis with bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin and other antimicrobial agents against genital  pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin was determined for 60 strains of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae, 15 strains of Chlamydia trachomatis and 40 strains each of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum and compared with those of ampicillin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, temafloxacin and tetracycline. Sparfloxacin was active against all the strains studied and appeared to be the most potent quinolone tested. Sparfloxacin had the lowest MICs against N. gonorrhoeae (MICs 0.002-0.06 micrograms/ml). Its MICs against C. trachomatis (0.03-0.06 micrograms/ml) were higher than those of clarithromycin but lower than those of the other antimicrobial agents. Sparfloxacin was particularly active against tetracycline-susceptible as well as resistant strains of M. hominis (MICs, 0.06 micrograms/ml) and U. urealyticum (MICs 0.125-1 micrograms/ml). Because of this in vitro activity and its tissue distribution, sparfloxacin might be a valuable therapeutic agent for treating major bacterial sexually transmitted diseases.
TI  - [Age and sex distribution of sexually transmitted diseases in Valladolid. A study of 5076 cases].
AB  - The age and sex distribution of 5,076 cases of S.T.D. dealt with between 1982 and 1988 at the Dermatological Dispensary of the Territorial Social Welfare Service in Valladolid are studied. The maximum frequency of S.T.D. (24.1% of cases) corresponded to the age group between 21 and 25 years, which was also the period for maximum prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26.3%), Gardnerella vaginalis (30.7%), Candida albicans (27.4%) and acuminata condyloma (33.4%). Syphilis (19.9%), Chlamydia trachomatis (27%), Ureaplasma urealyticum (24.6%), Mycoplasma hominis (25.0%), Trichomonas vaginalis (23.0%) and genital herpes had maximum prevalence in the group between 26 and 30 years. Women were affected at younger ages than males. 16.9% of women with some S.T.D. were between 16 and 20 years of age, while only 6.5% of males with S.T.D. were in this age-group (p less than 0.001).
TI  - Prevalence of sexually transmitted pathogens among women attending a methadone clinic in Israel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of sexually transmitted pathogens in drug-addicted women in Tel Aviv, Israel. DESIGN: A prospective study conducted between March and July 1987. SETTING: A methadone clinic in Tel Aviv, Israel. SUBJECTS: Sixty four asymptomatic female drug addicts were studied; 38 of them were declared practising prostitutes. METHODS: Cervical specimens were obtained for cultures, and blood samples were drawn for serological tests. Demographic data and sexual histories were obtained using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in the cervix of 25% of women; 98% had antibody titres (greater than 1:64). Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated in 57% and 65% respectively. Gardnerella vaginalis was detected in 17% of women, and herpes simplex virus was cultured from two prostitutes. Five per cent of women were carriers of HBsAg, while 57% had HBSs and/or HBc antibodies. Only one prostitute had specific treponemal antibodies. In no case were gonococci or group B streptococci isolated, and HIV serology was invariably negative. CONCLUSION: Chlamydia and genital mycoplasmas appear to be the prevailing pathogens in Israeli drug-addicted women, while gonococci and Treponema pallidum occur only rarely.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic features of urethritis in men in Toulouse, France.
AB  - On hundred twenty-six men who attended a hospital microbiology laboratory and 99  men who attended a private laboratory in Toulouse, France, for symptoms of urethritis were examined during 1988, for evidence of urethral pathogens. The following incidences were found: Neisseria gonorrhoeae: 24 (10.7%); Chlamydia trachomatis: 58 (25.8%); Ureaplasma urealyticum: 46 (20.4%); Gardnerella vaginalis: 21 (9.3%); Haemophilus parainfluenzae: 21 (9.3%); Streptococcus agalactiae: 15 (6.7%); Candida albicans: 10 (4.4%); and Trichomonas vaginalis: 4 (1.8%). The prevalence of these microorganisms was similar in the two groups of patients. No pathogen was isolated from 71 patients (31.6%). Mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 49 men (21.8%). Another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of urethral pathogens in relation to clinical findings. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated significantly more often in patients who had a urethral discharge (P less than .05) that contained five or more polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (PMN/HPF) (P less than .001). G. vaginalis was isolated significantly more often in patients who did not have an urethral discharge (P less than .05) and in men with less than five PMN/HPF (P less than .05). Isolation of C. albicans was significantly associated with pruritus (P less than .05) and balanitis (P less than .001). Like the clinical features, the gram-stained urethral smear was of limited value in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making regarding non-gonococcal urethritis. In contrast, this study underlines the importance of full identification of urethral isolates in the management of urethritis in men.
TI  - Prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  - Media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. The bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were Group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. A similar pattern of results was obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. In all experiments interleukin 1 beta consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. It is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. Furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.
TI  - Survival of Gardnerella vaginalis in human urine.
AB  - The authors studied the survival of Gardnerella vaginalis in human urine and determined conditions for optimum recovery on agar media. Gardnerella counts declined by greater than 99.9% in urine held at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, whereas the falloff was negligible at 4 degrees C. Viability was lost after 6 hours in urine with pH of 5, and only 0.01% cells survived in urine with pH of 7. In contrast, greater than 90% cells survived exposure at pH of 6. Dialysis to remove small molecular weight (less than 14,000) inhibitors did not enhance survival. Co-cultivation with Ureaplasma urealyticum and the addition of glycogen improved survival. Maximum recovery from urine required anaerobic incubation on enriched agar medium (pH 6.5-7.5) for at least 48 hours. Gardnerella vaginalis survives poorly in human urine at 37 degrees C. Culture for these bacteria requires prolonged anaerobic incubation.
TI  - Microbiological, epidemiological and clinical correlates of vaginal colonisation  by Mobiluncus species.
AB  - The microbiological and epidemiological correlates of vaginal colonisation by Mobiluncus species were examined among randomly selected women attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic. Women positive for Trichomonas vaginalis were excluded. Mobiluncus spp. were detected by Gram stained vaginal smear in 21% of 633 STD clinic patients, including 53% of those with and 4% of those without bacterial vaginosis (BV), as diagnosed by clinical criteria. Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis detected by vaginal culture and Mobiluncus detected by vaginal Gram stain were each independently associated with BV after adjusting by logistic regression for the presence of sexually transmitted disease pathogens, gravidity, parity and number of lifetime sexual partners (p less than 0.001 for each organism). Bacterial vaginosis was negatively correlated with isolation of lactobacilli, yeast and herpes simplex virus. After adjusting for presence or absence of BV, women with Mobiluncus were more likely to harbour G vaginalis (odds ratio 5.6, 95% confidence interval 1.6-19.5), M hominis (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.0-7.0) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.0) and less likely to harbour vaginal yeast (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-1.0); were more likely to be black (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5-4.6), and to have been pregnant (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1); but after the adjustment for BV, vaginal colonisation by Mobiluncus was not associated with symptoms of odour, abdominal pain, menstrual irregularities, or with adnexal tenderness. In summary, Mobiluncus, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis were independently associated with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and Mobiluncus was further associated with the presence of BV-associated microorganisms (M hominis and G vaginalis), N gonorrhoeae, black race, and gravidity.
TI  - The effect of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline plus metronidazole on lower genital tract flora in patients with proven pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Alterations in the lower genital tract flora were studied during antimicrobial treatment of 36 women with acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Sixteen women received ciprofloxacin, and 20 received doxycycline plus metronidazole. Both regimes eradicated Chlamydia trachomatis in all cases and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in all except one in which combination treatment failed because of resistance of the organism to tetracycline. Both regimes eradicated Mycoplasma hominis in all cases, while ciprofloxacin was somewhat less effective than combination treatment against Ureaplasma urealyticum. Ciprofloxacin was less effective than combination treatment against Gardnerella vaginalis. The incidence of Candida infection increased equally in both groups, although symptoms necessitating antifungal treatment were rare.
TI  - Survey of genitourinary organisms in a population of sexually active adolescent males admitted to a chemical dependency unit.
AB  - Sixty-two males consecutively admitted to an adolescent chemical dependency unit  for treatment over a one-year period were studied. When interviewed, all denied having urogenital symptoms. Forty-eight reported having had sexual intercourse. Of these 48, 34 were screened (urethral swab) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chylamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Eighteen of the 34 males who had complete screening were found to harbor one or more organisms: 3 had Chlamydia, 13 had Ureaplasma, and 11 had Gardnerella. In addition, 61 of the original 62 subjects were tested for serum antibodies to Treponema pallidum and for pyuria. No subjects were found to have syphilis. Pyuria was present in all subjects with Chlamydia but in only two with Ureaplasma or Gardnerella.
TI  - Evaluation of the significance of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum in female genital tract infection--a retrospective case note study.
AB  - Routine screening for sexually transmitted diseases in new patients attending the Genitourinary Clinic in Stoke-on-Trent includes a culture for Mycoplasma hominis (MH) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU). A retrospective study was carried out on 400 female patients to ascertain whether there were any significant differences between the group positive for MH and UU and the negative control group. The positive group were found to be younger on average, but to have similar sexual histories to the negative control group. An association was found between the presence of genital mycoplasmas and Gardnerella vaginalis. An odourous vaginal discharge was more common in the positive group. Erythromycin was ineffective in eradicating the organisms in 62.5% of patients with MH, and 70% of those with UU. Continuing work is required to identify those women in whom the presence of MH or UU could have pathogenic effects. Treatment regimens for this group of women need to be carefully reassessed, in the light of increasing antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Characterization of the Tet M determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus ducreyi, Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Veillonella parvula had DNA sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the Tet M transposon, Tn916. In contrast, Gardnerella vaginalis, commensal Neisseria spp., and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.
TI  - Association of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis with intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery. The John Hopkins Study of Cervicitis and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome.
AB  - The authors conducted a prospective study of risk factors for intrauterine growth retardation (birth weight less than a standard (race- and sex-adjusted) 10th percentile for gestational age) and preterm birth (birth prior to 37 weeks gestation) in a high-risk, inner-city, obstetric population, with special interest in pathogens colonizing the maternal genital tract. A total of 801 women within 22 to 30 weeks of gestation were enrolled and interviewed. Subjects were cultured for Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Candida albicans, and they were followed to delivery. Intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery occurred in 8% and 13% of these pregnancies, respectively. After adjustment for other important risk factors, colonization with C. trachomatis was significantly associated both with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 2.4, 90% confidence interval 1.32-4.18) and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 1.6, 90% confidence interval 1.01-2.50). Colonization with C. albicans was significantly associated with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 1.9, 90% confidence interval 1.20-3.14); colonization with M. hominis was significantly associated with preterm birth (odds ratio = 2.0, 90% confidence interval 1.42-2.93). These associations support the probable role of infection in preterm and intrauterine growth retardation births and suggest the need for carefully designed intervention studies.
TI  - Chlamydiazyme test for rapid detection of Chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  - Endocervical (120) and endourethral (104) swabs collected from patients attending the Gynaecological OPD and STD Clinic of a Hospital, in north India were subjected to the chlamydiazyme test to detect C. trachomatis antigen. This antigen was detected in 25 per cent (30 of 120) of cervical and 20.19 per cent (21 of 104) of urethral specimens. Of the 51 antigen positive cases, 30 (58.8%) presented with the clinical picture of cervicitis, 11 (21.5%) with urethritis, 6 (11.7%) were cases of primary infertility and 4 (7.8%) were healthy controls. The association of C. trachomatis and other sexually manifested microorganisms (Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis) was found more commonly in patients of cervicitis, especially those who were C. trachomatis antigen positive.
TI  - [Etiology of cervicovaginal infection in pregnant and non-pregnant patients].
AB  - A prospective study to evaluate the prevalence of specific microorganisms in pregnant and nonpregnant women with cervicovaginitis attended at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, was done; Candida sp, Gardnerella vaginalis, Replasma urealitycum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Group B Streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae were investigated. Two hundred thirty four patients were studied, 105/234 (44.9%) pregnant and 129/234 (55.1%) nonpregnant women, with a mean age of 26.5 years (range 14 to 44 years). One hundred eighty one (77.5%) women had only one sexual partner. The most common microorganisms seen were Candida sp (31.6%), Gardnerella vaginalis (27.7) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (15.8%). Infection by Chlamydia trachomatis was documented in 9.8% of the population. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.7%, there was not any case of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Candida sp and Ureaplasma urealyticum were founded more frequent in the pregnant women than nonpregnant women, 41.9% vs. 24.8% (p less than 0.01) and 20% vs. 12.4% (p less than 0.05) respectively. Group B Streptococci was isolated as a single agent in 4.8% in pregnant women. There were not found any pathogenic microorganisms in 29.9% of the cases, as a causal agent of symptomatic cervicovaginitis.
TI  - Early postpartum endometritis: the role of bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  - To characterize the flora of early postpartum endometritis and the clinical features of women with specific organisms, endometrial cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia trachomatis were taken with a triple-lumen sampling device. More than one organism was recovered from 80% of the women. Over 60% of the women had Gardnerella vaginalis and/or anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis isolated from the endometrium; these women were more likely to have severe illness and to develop a wound infection than were other women. Genital mycoplasmas were isolated frequently, but specific antibiotic therapy was not required for clinical cure in the 10% of patients who had Ureaplasma urealyticum only. Chlamydia trachomatis was infrequently isolated, but C trachomatis commonly remained after therapy.
TI  - [Genital infections in adolescence].
AB  - In 126 patients with relapsing cervicitis or abnormal cytologic findings, aged 13-19 years (12.5% were virgins), the most frequently bacteria were Ureaplasma urealyticum (30.2%), Mycoplasma hominis, and Gardnerella vaginalis (14.3%), and Chlamydia trachomatis (9.5%). In patients with abnormal cytologic findings, Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated most frequently--5 times in group IIIa after Papanicolaou and 4 times in group IIIb, followed by Mycoplasma hominis 3 times in group IIIa and IIIb each. Koilocytes were found twice in groups IIIa and IIIb each.
TI  - A case-control study of chorioamnionic infection and histologic chorioamnionitis  in prematurity.
AB  - To study the role of infection in prematurity, we studied the demographic and obstetrical characteristics, chorioamnionic cultures, and placental histologic features of women who delivered prematurely and compared these findings with those in women who delivered at term. Microorganisms were isolated from the area between the chorion and the amnion (chorioamnion) in 23 of 38 placentas (61 percent) from women with preterm labor who delivered before 37 weeks' gestation and in 12 (21 percent) of 56 placentas from women without preterm labor who delivered at term (odds ratio, 5.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 15.6). The most frequent isolates from the placentas of those whose infants were delivered prematurely were Ureaplasma urealyticum (47 percent) and Gardnerella vaginalis (26 percent). The recovery of any organism from the chorioamnion was strongly associated with histologic chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 7.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 19.5) and with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio, 3.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.6). When multiple logistic regression was used to control for demographic and obstetrical variables, premature delivery was still related to the recovery of organisms from the chorioamnion (odds ratio, 3.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 9.9) and with chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 5.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 15.3). The proportion of placentas with evidence of infection was highest among those who delivered at the lowest gestational age. We conclude that infection of the chorioamnion is strongly related to histologic chorioamnionitis and may be a cause of premature birth.
TI  - Microbiological profile of the cervix in 1,000 sexually active women.
AB  - One thousand consecutive women who attended the Richmond Family Planning Association Clinic and who were to undergo a vaginal examination were asked to participate in a large prospective microbiological study. Participants were questioned about their sexual activity during the previous 12 months and any apparent signs of sexually transmitted disease. On examination the cervix was inspected for evidence of inflammation, ectopy or discharge and cervical swabs were taken microbiological assessment. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 5.1% of women tested while Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis were found in 48.8% and 16.4% of women respectively. Significant associations were found between the number of sexual partners during the previous 12 months and the incidence of all 3 organisms. The carriage rate of the genital mycoplasmas was significantly affected by the type of contraception. In addition the association between the presence of the genital mycoplasmas and pelvic and cervical abnormalities was determined.
TI  - [Genital infections and the course of pregnancy: a prospective study].
AB  - The reported study investigates the relationship of genital infections, pathobiochemical findings and demographic data to preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and premature delivery. The predictability of chorioamnionitis, puerperal and neonatal infections by these parameters was evaluated concurrently. 301 patients were included in this study between July 1985 and June 1986. 147 of these patients were studied longitudinally during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium (longitudinal group). A second group consisted of 154 women who presented themselves on start of labor to the labor and delivery unit of our Department (peripartal group). The incidence of preterm labor and of PROM was 26%. The incidence of premature delivery, chorioamnionitis, puerperal and neonatal infection was 11.4%, 5.5%, 7.6% and 3% respectively. Cervical colonization with Mycoplasma hominis correlated positively with PROM (relative risk 2.2), premature delivery (3.9) and neonatal infection (6.9). Chorioamnionitis, premature delivery and puerperal infection were also significantly increased in patients with positive vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum cultures during pregnancy and delivery. Premature delivery (2.8) and puerperal infection (4.0) were associated with a vaginal group B-Streptococci (GBS) colonization during pregnancy, as was a positive GBS culture during delivery associated with puerperal infection. Bacterial vaginosis also correlated positively with premature delivery (5.6) and puerperal infection. Preterm labor correlated negatively with the socioeconomic level, PROM correlated negatively with the marital status, positively with age, a history of cervical cerclage, conization or PROM during former pregnancies. Sexual intercourse more often than once weekly during the last month of pregnancy was also associated with an increased number of PROM. Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida and Trichomoniasis during pregnancy and delivery were associated with preterm labor and puerperal infections. Levels of maternal plasma fibrinogen concentrations in patients with PROM were elevated 48 hours after delivery in accordance to the characteristics of acute phase proteins. In contrast, the maternal PMN-granulocyte-elastase concentration was significantly elevated at time of delivery and 24 hours thereafter in those patients who developed puerperal infections. The derived positive predictive value was 26%, the negative 94.7%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the prediction was 83.1%. Six out of seven mothers with neonates treated because of neonatal infection showed significantly elevated plasma concentration of PMN-granulocyte-elastase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis is associated with other sexually transmittable microorganisms in the male urethra.
AB  - In a prospective study, urethral swabs were taken from 544 men presented to an STD clinic, 118 with and 426 without urethritis, and examined by microscope and/or culture for G. vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Candida species and Trichomonas vaginalis. G. vaginalis was isolated from 4.2% of the males with urethritis and from 6.3% of those without urethritis. Using loglinear analysis, the following associations were significant (p less than 0.05): three-way: G. vaginalis, U. urealyticum, C. trachomatis; two-way: G. vaginalis, U. urealyticum and G. vaginalis, M. hominis and U. urealyticum, M. hominis. It is concluded that G. vaginalis is associated with genital mycoplasmas not only in the female, but also in the male urogenital tract.
TI  - Prevalence of lower genital tract infections in pregnancy.
AB  - A descriptive profile of 106 pregnant women with various forms of cervicitis and  vaginitis is provided. Fifty women attending individual physicians' private offices are compared with 56 clinic patients: 34 attending a university prenatal teaching clinic and 22 attending a pregnancy termination unit. Univariate analysis showed that single women were significantly more likely to be infected by mycoplasmas, yeasts, trichomonads, and Gardnerella vaginalis than were married women. Teenagers were more frequently infected by Mycoplasma hominis, yeasts, and Trichomonas vaginalis than were women older than 20 years. After stepwise logistic regression analysis, the most significant predictor of infection with M. hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, or yeasts was being a clinic patient; for G. vaginalis, the most significant variable was being unmarried. These data suggest that teenaged and single women who are pregnant will benefit most from routine screening for vaginitis/cervicitis-producing microorganisms.
TI  - A review of the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin against genital pathogens.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of roxithromycin against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Treponema pallidum, Gardnerella vaginalis and Haemophilus ducreyi is reviewed. Roxithromycin demonstrated equivalent activity to erythromycin against N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, G. vaginalis and H. ducreyi. In a rabbit model for syphilis, potentially useful activity against T. pallidum has been demonstrated.
TI  - Roxithromycin in nongonococcal urethritis.
AB  - This presentation is a summary of five different studies on the efficacy and tolerance of roxithromycin in the treatment of non-gonococcal genital infections. Three of the studies were double-blind comparative and two were open studies. Of the 924 out-patients whose data were analysed for clinical efficacy, 637 received treatment with roxithromycin 150 mg bd. The standard dose of roxithromycin, 150 mg bd for ten days, was compared with doxycycline 200 mg daily, lymecycline 300 mg bd and roxithromycin 450 mg once daily. The overall clinical success rate was 90% (576 of 637 patients) for roxithromycin 150 mg bd. In the three comparative trials, no significant difference was found between the clinical success rates of roxithromycin 150 mg bd and the other drugs. The overall clinical success rate with roxithromycin 150 mg bd was 92% (512/558) in nongonococcal urethritis and 81% (64/79) in cervicovaginitis. Taking into account all patients treated with roxithromycin 150 mg bd, the bacteriological success rate was 90% (444/492). In the comparative trials, no significant difference could be found between the treatment groups. Roxithromycin 150 mg bd was effective in eradicating 97% (308/316) of the isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis, 88% (149/170) of Ureaplasma urealyticum, 73% (40/55) of Mycoplasma hominis and 57% (13/23) of Gardnerella vaginalis. The present findings show that a high cure rate can be achieved with a ten-day course of treatment with roxithromycin and that it is at least as effective as the tetracyclines commonly used in the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis. A higher dosage than 300 mg/day of roxithromycin did not offer any clear advantage in terms of efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The midcycle cervical microbial flora as studied by the weighed-swab method, and  its possible correlation with results of sperm cervical mucus penetration tests.
AB  - Infertile couples undergoing routine investigation for infertility were randomly  selected for the study. A quantitative method using weighed swabs was found satisfactory for the study of microbial flora in the midcycle cervical mucus. In 6 of the 20 women, the midcycle cervical mucus was hostile in the sperm cervical mucus penetration tests. The total bacterial counts and the number of species (average, 2.5) isolated from the hostile mucus were significantly greater than those from the receptive mucus (average, 1.3). Only normal vaginal/cervical flora was isolated. Ureaplasma urealyticum was found more frequently in patients undergoing clomiphene citrate therapy (6/10 versus 0/9, P less than 0.03, Fischer's Exact test).
TI  - Infection with multiple sexually transmitted agents.
AB  - A patient named as a contact by an individual with gonorrhea and syphilis was found to be an asymptomatic carrier of seven organisms known to be transmitted sexually. Cultures were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Herpes simplex virus. Trichomonas vaginalis was detected by a wet preparation and the Papanicolaou smear. The cervix was found to have an ulcer on the posterior lip that yielded Herpes simplex on culture. Although the venereal disease reaction level (VDRL) and the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption tests (FTA-ABS) were negative, and treponemes were not identified on dark-field microscopy, a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction on this patient raised the possibility that she also had incubating syphilis.
TI  - The acute urethral syndrome in routine practice.
AB  - Midstream samples of urine from 185 acutely dysuric women and 89 symptom-free controls were screened according to the modified criteria of Kass by both conventional and microaerophilic culture. Among the 185 symptomatic women, coliform bacilli were isolated from 125 (67.5%) and in 45 (36%) of the latter the concentration of these organisms in the urine was less than 10(8)/l. Fastidious organisms were isolated in pure and mixed cultures from 25 (13.4%) of the 185 patients and from 4 (4.5%) of 89 controls. Staphylococcus species were isolated from 10.8% (9.7% S. saprophyticus; 1.1% S. epidermidis) and Ureaplasma urealyticum from 2.7%. All patients infected with conventional organisms but only 30.4% of those yielding fastidious organisms had pyuria. The isolation rate of fastidious organisms tended to be higher (P = 0.055) in symptomatic women that in symptom-free controls.
TI  - Salpingitis; aspects of diagnosis and etiology: a 4-year study from a Swedish capital hospital.
AB  - 359 patients underwent laparoscopy to verify the diagnosis of salpingitis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was found in 187 (52%) cases. Laparoscopy revealed normal conditions in 136 (37%) cases. Other diseases were diagnosed in 36 (10%) cases. Bacteriological cultures from the fimbrial lumen were positive in 24% of the PID cases. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) was detected in 12%, Bacteroides species (BS) in 5%, Actinomyces israelii (AI) in 3%, Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) in 2%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in 1%, and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) in 1%. Cervical cultures were positive for NG and/or CT in 71% of the PID cases but only in 19% of the non-PID cases. From these no positive intra-abdominal cultures were detected. Serological tests for CT were carried out. A positive acute titre of greater than or equal to 1/64 was noted in 37%, a seroconversion (X4) 2-3 weeks later was found in 14%. Positive serology despite a negative culture was registered in 19%.
TI  - Syphilitic patients with urogenital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  
TI  - Transmission rate of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, B-streptococci, Candida spp. and Chlamydia trachomatis from the mother to the newborn.
AB  - In a preliminary study of the transmission rate of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma species, Gardnerella vaginalis, B-Streptococci, Candida species and Chlamydia trachomatis from the mother to the newborn, swabs were taken from 45 parturients and their neonates and cultured by suitable methods. Out of 30 parturients with a positive culture, 8 harboured more than one microorganism investigated. U. urealyticum was found in 11 newborn and all of them had a positive mother. Candida spp. were found in 4 newborn, but 3 of these had a negative mother. G. vaginalis was detected in only 1 infant and the mother was negative. C. trachomatis was not isolated from any mother but was present in 2 newborn infants. Thus only U. urealyticum showed clear evidence of transmission from mother to baby.
TI  - Bacteriuria due to ureaplasmas and other fastidious organisms during pregnancy: prevalence and significance.
AB  - When urine, which has been collected by suprapubic bladder aspiration, is appropriately cultured, asymptomatic bacteriuria due to fastidious organisms can be detected quite commonly in apparently healthy pregnant women; Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis can each be isolated from the bladder urine of 10 to 15% of subjects, other bacteria less frequently. Both organisms are often present together, sometimes in addition to "conventional" urinary pathogens. Overall bacteriuria occurs in about 25% of healthy pregnant women, including 6% with "conventional" asymptomatic bacteriuria. Pyuria occurs in about one-third of patients with fastidious bacteriuria. Bacteriuria due to fastidious bacteria occurs significantly more commonly in selected groups of pregnant women. U. urealyticum or G. vaginalis or both can be isolated, generally in relatively high numbers from more than 70% of pregnant women with renal disease and 20 to 30% of those with preeclampsia. In a prospective study in which urine was collected using an open ended catheter, ureaplasmas were isolated 3 times more frequently from women less than 25 years of age than from older women. Women with Ureaplasma bacteriuria at the first antenatal visit were 3 times more likely to develop preeclampsia than those without, but the mean birth weights of the infants born to the two groups of women were not significantly different. Further studies are required to determine the importance of these preliminary findings.
TI  - High-level tetracycline resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is result of acquisition of streptococcal tetM determinant.
AB  - Recently, strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae have been isolated which are highly resistant to tetracycline (MICs of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml). This resistance was due to the acquisition of the resistance determinant tetM, a transposon-borne determinant initially found in the genus Streptococcus and more recently in Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Gardnerella vaginalis. In N. gonorrhoeae, the tetM determinant was located on a 25.2-megadalton plasmid. This plasmid arose from the insertion of tetM into the 24.5-megadalton gonococcal conjugative plasmid. The tetM determinant could be transferred to suitable recipient strains of N. gonorrhoeae by both genetic transformation and conjugation.
TI  - In vitro activity of the two new 4-quinolones A56619 and A56620 against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and two recently developed 1-aryl-fluoroquinolones, A56610 and A56620, was tested against 65 beta-lactamase-negative and 35 beta-lactamase-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 12 Chlamydia trachomatis, 50 Mycoplasma hominis, 28 Ureaplasma urealyticum and 50 Gardnerella vaginalis strains. In the case of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis both the MIC and the MBC were determined. The MIC90 of ciprofloxacin for Neisseria gonorrhoeae was 0.008 microgram/ml and of A56619 and A56620 less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. No difference was observed between the activity against beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive strains. The MIC90 values of of ciprofloxacin and A56620 for Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum were identical, the values being 2 micrograms/ml, 1 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml respectively. The MIC90 of A56619 for Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum was 0.5 micrograms/ml and 1 microgram/ml respectively. The MBC90 values of the three quinolones for Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. The activity of the quinolones against Gardnerella vaginalis was rather low, the MIC90 being greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. It is concluded that A56619 and A56620 might be useful for single-dose therapy of gonococcal infections.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis-associated balanoposthitis.
AB  - The clinical features, microbiologic investigation, and response to therapy of three patients with Gardnerella vaginalis-associated balanoposthitis were studied. Each man presented with a similar syndrome of diffuse erythema and pruritus of the glans meatus and coronal sulcus, irritation of the prepuce, and minimal urethral discharge. A characteristic fishy odor was present in the urethral discharge of all three patients. G. vaginalis was isolated from the glans of all three, and clue cells were present in two. In all cases, cultures for Candida albicans, herpes simplex virus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were negative. All three patients responded to oral therapy with metronidazole and concurrent treatment of the partner. Two patients subsequently relapsed but ultimately responded to clindamycin therapy. These men presented with a distinctive clinical syndrome of balanoposthitis associated with G. vaginalis, which is in many respects similar to the syndrome of bacterial vaginosis in women. Our data indicate that balanoposthitis may have a polymicrobial and synergistic etiology involving G. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in the male lower genital tract; such an etiology is analogous to that of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Endometrial cultures obtained by a triple-lumen method from afebrile and febrile  postpartum women.
AB  - Transfundal endometrial cultures obtained from afebrile women who delivered vaginally were uniformly free of bacteria and contained Ureaplasma urealyticum in only 2 of 14 women. A protected triple-lumen transcervical method to obtain an endometrial culture recovered organisms from 6 (43%) of the 14 women. Compared with cultures from afebrile women, organisms were recovered from 51 (93%) of 55 febrile postpartum women by using the triple-lumen transcervical culture method (P less than .001). Among febrile women there was a correlation between the recovery of group B Streptococcus, enterococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria from the cervix and their recovery from the endometrium. Protected transcervical methods used to obtain postpartum endometrial cultures reduce cervical contamination, but semiquantitation of the culture is useful to further increase culture specificity.
TI  - Polymicrobial early postpartum endometritis with facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia trachomatis: treatment with piperacillin or cefoxitin.
AB  - A protected, triple-lumen transcervical culture method was used to recover organisms from the endometrium. At least one facultative or one anaerobic species of bacteria was recovered from 82% of the patients, and genital mycoplasmas were recovered from 76% of the women with endometritis. Bacteria together with genital mycoplasmas were present in 61% of the women, bacteria alone were present in 20%, genital mycoplasmas alone were present in 16%, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 2% of the patients. The most common organisms included Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B Streptococcus, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. A randomized, double-blind regimen of either piperacillin or cefoxitin was equally successful in treating the postpartum endometritis.
TI  - Sexually transmissible infectious agents in sexually active and virginal asymptomatic adolescent girls.
AB  - Sixty-eight sexually active and 52 virginal adolescent girls were evaluated for six sexually transmissible infectious agents: Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. There were significant differences between sexually active and virginal girls with respect to the prevalence of isolation of U urealyticum (75% v 33%, P less than .005), M hominis (27% v 10%, P less than .05), and C trachomatis (19% v 2%, P less than .025) but not for G vaginalis (34% v 17%, P = .09). N gonorrhoeae and T vaginalis were isolated exclusively from sexually active girls, but their low prevalence (6% and 9%, respectively) made the difference statistically insignificant (P = .2 and .06, respectively). Race, current v previous sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, oral contraceptive use, and concurrent isolation of another organism did not identify those at increased risk for chlamydial isolation. Such girls were significantly more likely to have inflammatory Papanicolaou smears (36% v 10%, P less than .05) and excessive WBC in their vaginal secretions (50% v 19%, P = .05). The data support the contention that C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, and T vaginalis are organisms that are predominantly acquired via sexual routes. Significant nonsexual modes of transmission are supported by the data for the genital mycoplasmas and G vaginalis. Finally, a history of sexual activity in an adolescent female warrants specific diagnostic testing for Chlamydia.
TI  - Etiology of cervical inflammation.
AB  - We studied the relationships of selected microbial, clinical, demographic, and behavioral variables to mucopurulent cervicitis in two clinical settings, a sexually transmitted disease clinic and a student health clinic. From each clinic, we studied a group of women referred for suspected mucopurulent cervicitis and a representative sample of other women attending the clinic. After the women were stratified by patient group and summary odds ratios for all groups were obtained, mucopurulent cervicitis was most strongly associated with the isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis; other variables associated with mucopurulent cervicitis included the isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, the presence of serum antibody to C. trachomatis, the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and oral contraceptive use (positive associations) or isolation of yeast (negative association). After adjustment for cervical culture results for C. trachomatis, mucopurulent cervicitis was positively associated with oral contraceptive use (p = 0.02) and isolation of U. urealyticum (p = 0.02) and negatively associated with isolation of yeast (p = 0.03). Among women with a positive cervical culture for C. trachomatis, isolation of U. urealyticum was significantly associated with mucopurulent cervicitis, while among the subgroup of women with a negative cervical culture for C. trachomatis and positive serum antibody to C. trachomatis, oral contraceptive use was strongly associated with mucopurulent cervicitis. These results confirm that in both clinical settings C. trachomatis is the major cause of mucopurulent cervicitis. The roles of U. urealyticum, T. vaginalis, G. vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, and oral contraceptive use in the etiology of mucopurulent cervicitis deserve further study.
TI  - [Amine colpitis].
AB  - Significance of KOH test and isonitril (isocyanide) reaction tested in 104 patients was compared with our microbial culture results. In Gardnerella vaginalis as well as in no spores forming anaerobic germs the KOH test was not and the isonitril reaction was only insignificant reliable. Both tests are not able to substitute the procedures of culturing germs including those of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum.
TI  - Microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - The prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, lactobacillus, Mycoplasma species, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. Sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (SD = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (SD = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (P = 0.001). Sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal G. vaginalis, lactobacilli, Mycoplasma species, and U. urealyticum, as well as endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoea, and T. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. Significant differences in isolation rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis. In general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; N. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. Differences were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific vaginitis. Vaginal G. vaginalis and Mycoplasma species and endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. It is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.
TI  - [Detection of Gardnerella vaginalis in the pathogen spectrum of sexually transmissible diseases in vulvovaginitis].
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis, a sexually transmittable organism, is regarded as the indicator of the so-called "non-specific vaginitis". The isolation rate of G. vaginalis from 72 women attending our out-patient department during one year because of urogenital complaints was higher in pretreated than in untreated patients. In genital swabs taken from untreated patients, G. vaginalis could be isolated only in 17%, whereas this was observed in 38% of the specimens from women pretreated with various antimicrobial agents. In 9% of the women without vaginal discharge G. vaginalis was isolated. In specimens obtained from 53% of the women positive for G. vaginalis further organisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma spp. and B-Streptococci could be isolated. Asymptomatic infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1) and C. trachomatis (4) were also observed. The present study clearly demonstrates that a broad microbiological examination is essential for specific therapy in vaginitis. Even if unspecific vaginitis is diagnosed by the presence of clue-cells, increased vaginal pH and fishy odour, a combined infection by further sexually transmittable organisms, especially N. gonorrhoeae, is to be excluded.
TI  - [Prevalence of 7 microorganisms in abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis)].
AB  - Seven microorganisms (N. gonorrhoeae, C. albicans, T. vaginalis, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, U. urealyticum and Streptococcus of group B) have been assayed in genital samplings of 164 asymptomatic women (control group) and of 374 women suffering from abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis group). All these bacteria except group B Streptococci were isolated in the vaginitis group more frequently than in the control group (p less than 0.01). The proportion of negative cultures for all tested bacteria was 39% in the control group and 6.4% in the vaginitis group (p less than 0.01). This shows an association of these bacteria with 70% of the patients of the vaginitis group and with only 26% of the women of the control group (p less than 0.01). It is to be noted that the pH values are higher in the group of women with vaginitis than in the control group (p less than 0.01). Comparison of the microbial flora during "specific" an "non-specific" vaginitis indicates that G. vaginalis is isolated more frequently in patients with non-specific vaginitis than among those with specific vaginitis (p less than 0.01). Likewise, M. hominis is isolated more frequently in groups of women with either non-specific vaginitis or T. vaginalis vaginitis, than in groups of patients with a C. albicans vaginitis (p less than 0,01). The results of this study indicate that there is a causal relationship between vaginitis and the presence of T. vaginalis. C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis or N. gonorrhoeae, either as a single or a mixed infection, and that there is a relationship between increased pH values and abnormal vaginal secretions.
TI  - The association of sexually transmitted diseases with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a case-control study.
AB  - Thirty-three women with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (grades I to III, with one case of microinvasive carcinoma) and 54 women without evidence of the disease were prospectively studied to determine the relationship of genital infection to cervical neoplasia. Demographic and sexual data for patients and control subjects were collected, with standardized clinical and colposcopic evaluation by means of predefined diagnostic categories. Cultures from the cervix were examined for herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Human papilloma virus infection was identified by characteristic changes of koilocytosis in cytologic or histopathologic specimen. Cultures from the vagina were evaluated for Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Candida albicans, and other yeasts. Separate Gram strains were prepared from endocervical secretions and from vaginal secretions. More lifetime sexual partners, larger area of transformation zone, evidence of human papilloma virus infection, and altered vaginal flora were observed in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The association of human papilloma virus infection and altered vaginal flora with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was independent of sexual experience.
TI  - Bacteriuria due to Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis in women with preeclampsia.
AB  - Certain fastidious organisms such as U urealyticum and G vaginalis can be isolated from the aspirated bladder urine of pregnant women more frequently than conventional urinary pathogens such as Escherichia coli [1]. They can be isolated even more often from the aspirated bladder urine of patients with renal disease, but rarely from that of healthy men or nonpregnant women [2]. We investigated the incidence of bacteriuria due to these two organisms--particularly U urealyticum--in patients with preeclampsia. U urealyticum was isolated more frequently (rate, 20%), and usually in higher colony counts, from the urine of patients with preeclampsia than from that of healthy pregnant women (rate, 7%). G vaginalis was isolated with approximately the same frequency as U urealyticum from specimens of bladder urine; both organisms were isolated from the urine of 11 patients (eight healthy women and three with preeclampsia). High colony counts of G vaginalis were also found more frequently in patients with preeclampsia. In both groups other fastidious organisms were isolated in a total of only five patients, and in four of these five cases U urealyticum and/or G vaginalis were also isolated from the same specimen. Urine cultures were more frequently positive in patients with moderately severe hypertension (blood pressure, greater than 160/100 mm Hg) than in those with mild hypertension (blood pressure, 140/90-160/100 mm Hg, occurring in nine (53%) of 17 patients and in nine (26.5%) of 34 patients, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Unconventional bacteria in urinary tract disease: Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bladder aspirate urine samples (N = 190) were cultured for the presence of fastidious microorganisms. These samples were obtained from patients with urinary tract disease in whom standard bacteriologic investigation had failed to indicate infection. Gardnerella vaginalis was recovered alone, or in association with Ureaplasma urealyticum from the bladder urine of 33% of patients with reflux scarring. G. vaginalis was localized to the upper urinary tract in 75% of these patients with bladder counts greater than 10(3) colony-forming units per milliliter. The results show that two fastidious microbial species, not conventionally associated with urinary tract infection, are recoverable from the upper urinary tracts of patients with so-called sterile pyelonephritis.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae in genitourinary tract infections.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae was isolated in pure or predominant culture from genital specimens from nine females and two males. Four of the females had vaginitis, two had IUD-related endometritis, one had an incomplete septic abortion, and one had probable urethral syndrome. Two males had urethritis.
TI  - Comparison of mid catheter collection and suprapubic aspiration of urine for diagnosing bacteriuria due to fastidious micro-organisms.
AB  - We examined 40 female patients for the presence of fastidious bacteria in the bladder by culture of mid catheter and suprapubic aspiration urine specimens. Gardnerella vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum were the most frequently isolated fastidious species. The suprapubic aspirate was positive in 3 patients with more than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml. Gardnerella vaginalis and 7 with more than 10(2) colony-forming units per ml. Ureaplasma urealyticum in the mid catheter urine specimen, while it was negative for bacteria in 6 patients with less than 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. coryneform bacilli or lactobacilli in the mid catheter urine specimen. The results show that culture of mid catheter urine samples provides a reasonable guide to the presence of bacteriuria owing to fastidious micro-organisms and can be used when a suprapubic aspiration specimen cannot be obtained easily.

TI  - Vaginitis in sexually active women: relationship to nine sexually transmitted organisms.
AB  - Women seen for symptoms suggestive of vulvovaginitis were studied for the detection of Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum, yeast, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, aerobes, anaerobes, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Asymptomatic women who reported to be sexually active and agreed to undergo comprehensive genital cultures were used as controls. There was a significant association of vulvovaginitis with the recovery of sexually transmitted organisms. However, all organisms were also recovered from asymptomatic patients. A total of 468 sexually transmitted organisms were recovered from 253 symptomatic patients (1.85 organisms per patient), while 125 were recovered from 130 asymptomatic patients (0.96 organisms per patient). The difference in prevalence between symptomatic and asymptomatic women for Chlamydia trachomatis, group B streptococcus, and the mycoplasmas was not statistically significant. Factors that predispose patients to the manifestations of symptoms are not clearly understood.
TI  - Polymicrobial nature of vaginitis in young women: a microbiological and therapeutic study.
AB  - Thirty-six young females attending the Student Health Service with vaginitis were investigated by serial semiquantitative aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, mycoplasma and viral cultures over a 10 day period and results were correlated with signs and symptoms. Antifungal therapy (econazole pessaries and cream) resulted in clearance of candida from 13 out of 16 patients where there was no increase in the anaerobic flora. In the four subjects where candida was isolated along with Gardnerella vaginalis plus abnormal anaerobic flora, only one cleared with econazole, the remaining three clearing during therapy with metronidazole. In the nine subjects with Gardnerella vaginalis and abnormal anaerobic flora, metronidazole relieved symptoms despite failure to eradicate G. vaginalis in seven indicating the pathogenic role of the anaerobic flora rather then G. vaginalis. Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and gram negative enteric bacilli were not implicated as primary agents in causing vaginitis.
TI  - Anaerobic and other fastidious microorganisms in asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women.
AB  - Urine from 44 pregnant women with known or suspected renal disease (group 1) and  from 50 healthy pregnant women (group 2) with negative routine cultures of midstream urine was obtained by suprapubic aspiration. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures showed bacteriuria in 70% of the women in group 1 and in 26% of those in group 2. Gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequently isolated organism. Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated from 14(48%) of 29 women in group 1 and from two (12.5%) of 16 women in group 2. Radiologic studies showed a high incidence of underlying renal disease in asymptomatic women with bacteriuria. Localization testing indicated kidney infection in six of 14 women in group 1 and in one of four women in group 2. These findings suggest that there is an increased susceptibility to colonization of the bladder with these microorganisms during pregnancy and that persistence of infection and renal involvement are associated with underlying renal disease.
TI  - Ureaplasma urealyticum in the upper urinary tracts of renal allograft recipients.
AB  - Urine samples from 123 renal transplant recipients were cultured for the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and other fastidious microorganisms. Ureaplasmas were recovered alone or in association with other microbial species from the bladder urine of 13 (11%) of the 123 patients, and evidence of involvement of the upper urinary tract was present in nine patients. Colonization of the upper urinary tract by U. urealyticum was not associated with a decline in function of the grafted kidney and was found only in patients with a primary diagnosis of reflux nephropathy (50% of such patients were positive for ureaplasmas) or glomerulonephritis (10% were positive) who had their own kidneys. The next most common isolate was Gardnerella vaginalis, recovered from 7% of patients, the majority of whom harbored the organism in the bladder only. The results confirm that U. urealyticum may colonize the upper urinary tracts of patients with proven renal disease.
TI  - Sexually transmitted conditions among women college students.
AB  - We studied 500 unselected young women who consulted a gynecologist in a student health service. Most participants were symptom-free and had normal physical examinations. Few sexually transmitted infections were encountered. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was recovered from two and Trichomonas vaginalis was obtained from 14 of 500 women. Chlamydia trachomatis was recovered from 20 (4.6%) of 439 participants. Genital warts, genital herpes, and molluscum contagiosum, respectively, were noted in seven, four, and one of the 500 participants. There was no cases of syphilis, scabies, or pediculosis pubis. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum, respectively, were recovered from 17.6 and 56.8% of the subjects. Prevalent vaginal bacteria included lactobacilli, streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from the vaginal specimens of about one third of the participants.
TI  - Etiology of nongonococcal urethritis. Evidence for Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum (T-mycoplasma), and Hemophilus vaginalis have previously been considered possible etiological agents in nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). In this study, current C. trachomatis infection was confirmed by culture and (or) micro-immunofluorescence serology in 26 of 69 men experiencing afirst episode of NGU, and 1 of 39 with no urethritis. Serum IgM immunofluorescent antibody to chlamydia was demonstrated in 16 of 20 men with chlamydia culture positive NGU, and 3 of 39 with chlamydia culture negative NG, and none of 34 with no urethritis. 9 of 10 culture positive men with less than or equal to 10 days symptoms developed immunofluorescent antibody seroconversion in paired sera. U. realyticum was isolated significantly more often and in significantly higher concentration from first voided urine from chlamydia-negative cases of NGU than from chlamydia-positive NGU. Ureaplasmacidal antibody titers increased fourfold in six men, four of whom had negative cultures for for unreaplasma. H. vaginalis was isolated from c9 of 33 men with no urethritis and 2 of 69 with NGU. C. trachomatis is susceptible, and U. urealyticum is resistant to sulfonamides. A 10-day course of sulfisoxazole therapy produced improvement in 13 of 13 chlamydia-positive, unreaplasma-negative, and only 14 of 29 chlamydia-negative, unreaplasma-positive NGU cases (P less than 0.002). Thus, culture, serology, and response to therapy support the etiologic role of chlamydia in NGU. Quantitative culture and response to therapy suggest U. unrealyticum may cause many cases of chlamydia-netative NGU.
